In current study, 6 COVID-19 subjects with respiratory failure received convalescent plasma at a median of 21.5 days after first detection of viral shedding, all tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 RNA by 3 days after infusion, and 5 died eventually. In conclusion, convalescent plasma treatment can discontinue SARS-CoV-2 shedding but cannot reduce mortality in critically end-stage COVID-19 patients, and treatment should be initiated earlier.\nConvalescent plasma therapy, Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), Fatality, Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), Survival rate, Viral shedding\nTopic: plasma virus shedding sars-cov-2 covid-19\nIssue Section: Brief Report\nPDF\nThis content is only available as a PDF.\nAuthor notes\n\" These authors contributed equally to this article.\n\u00a9 The Author(s) 2020.

We utilized confirmed cases outside Hubei Province to analyze epidemiologic characteristics and evaluate the effect of traffic restrictions implemented in Hubei beginning on January 23, 2020.\nMethod\nInformation on 7,015 confirmed cases from January 19 to February 8, 2020, in all provinces outside Hubei was collected from the national and local health commissions in China. Incubation period and interval times were calculated using dates of the following events: contact with an infected person, onset, first visit and diagnosis. We evaluated changes in incubation period and interval times.\nResults\nThe average age of all cases was 44.24 years old. The median incubation period was 5 days and extended from 2 days on January 23 to 15 days on February 8. The proportion of imported cases decreased from 85.71% to 33.19% after January 23. In addition, the lengths of the intervals between onset and diagnosis, onset and first visit, and first visit and diagnosis decreased over time.\nConclusion\nRapidly transmitting COVID-19 has a short incubation period.

The median period from diagnosis to negative nucleic acid test was significantly different between patients with normal or atypical chest computed tomography (CT) findings (n\u2005=\u200516, 61.5%; 7.5 days [2\u201320 days]) and patients with typical ground-glass or patchy opacities on CT (n\u2005=\u200510, 38.5%; 12.5 days [8\u201322 days]; P\u2005<\u2005.01).

Obvious improvement in CT findings was observed in 3 patients (30.0%) despite positive nucleic acid test results.\nConclusions\nIn asymptomatic patients, changes in biochemical and inflammatory variables are small and changes on chest CT can occur. It is worth noting that the long existence of SARS-CoV-2 in some asymptomatic patients and false-negative results need to be considered in SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid test.\nasymptomatic, clinical characteristics, coronavirus disease 2019, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2\nTopic: nucleic acids diagnosis chest ct sars-cov-2 covid-19\nIssue Section: Major Article\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the causation agent of a novel respiratory infectious coronavirus disease (termed COVID-2019), which has disseminated quickly among people. Since its initial outbreak in Wuhan, China was reported in December 2019, there have been 1\u2005279\u2005722 cases worldwide up to April 7, 2020 [1, 2]. COVID-19 is highly contagious with rapid transmission, and people are general susceptible to this new coronavirus.\nPatients with SARS-CoV-2 infection may show COVID-19-related symptoms. Asymptomatic carriers have also been found [3]. For instance, there are reports documenting a substantial fraction of truly asymptomatic individuals with COVID-19 from the Diamond Princess Cruise ship (approximately 18%) and Japanese evacuees out of Wuhan [4, 5]. There are a few other case reports in various journals in Table 1 [3, 6\u201310]. These reports mainly focus on the estimated asymptomatic proportion, mode of transmission, some radiological findings, and solutions to identify and isolate asymptomatic patients. Emerging evidence suggests that patients with clinical manifestations are contagious, with analysis of their clinical characteristics [11, 12]. However, there are few studies that report the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of asymptomatic patients. A few studies have described the clinical characteristics of asymptomatic patients, but some of the asymptomatic patients in these studies were asymptomatic at the time of diagnosis but later developed symptoms, so they cannot truly represent the clinical characteristics of asymptomatic patients [13, 14]. In this study, we identified a total of 26 persistently asymptomatic patients with positive test results for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid to determine the clinical characteristics and asymptomatic carrier transmission of COVID-19 infection.\nTable 1.\nAsymptomatic Cases Reports in Various Journals\nJournal Research Focus Location Reference\nN Engl J Med  Transmission of 2019-nCoV infection from an asymptomatic contact  Germany  Rothe et al [3] \nBMJ  Identifying and isolating asymptomatic people  Italian Village  Day [6] \nLancet Infect Dis  Radiological findings in both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients  Wuhan, China  Shi et al [7] \nJ Nucl Med  Nuclear medicine services in asymptomatic patients  Brescia, Italy  Albano et al [8] \nLancet Infect Dis  Asymptomatic cases in a family cluster with SARS-CoV-2 infection  Guangdong, China  Pan et al [9] \nInt J Infect Dis  Delivery of infection from asymptomatic carriers of COVID-19 in a familial cluster  Chengdu, China  Ye et al [10] \nAbbreviations: 2019-nCoV, novel coronavirus; COVID-19, coronavirus disease 2019; SARS-CoV-2, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2.\nOpen in new tab\nMETHODS\nStudy Design\nA total of 26 hospitalized patients with a SARS-CoV-2 epidemiological history and positive SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid test results were identified to analyze the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of COVID-19-infected asymptomatic carriers. These patients\u2019 sputum and throat swabs were sampled for SARS-CoV-2 confirmation and tested using reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction. An epidemiological history was defined as a close contact with a diagnosed or possible case of COVID-19 or had a history of residence in or travel to Wuhan. Informed consent was obtained from each registered patient, and this study was reviewed and approved by the Medical Ethics Committee of Zhengzhou University.\nData Collection\nDetailed information regarding the epidemiological history and information of other family members of each patient was obtained. We also collected information regarding patient age, sex, previous medical history, clinical manifestations, laboratory tests, chest computed tomography (CT) scans, treatment measures, and prognosis.\nStatistical Analysis\nNormally distributed continuous variables are presented as mean\u2005\u00b1\u2005standard deviation and were compared using the t test. Nonnormally distributed data are described as the median and were analyzed using the rank-sum test of 2 groups. Categorical variables are show as percentages. All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS software, version 22.0.\nRESULTS\nBasic Information\nA total of 26 patients with asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection were collected in this study: 16 (61.5%) were men and 10 (38.5%) were women. The median age was 29.5 years (2 to 80 years), and the age of 18 patients (69.2%) ranged from 20 to 60 years. Two patients had a history of smoking (both for over 20 years), with an average of 20 cigarettes per day. Two patients had a history of hypertension and 1 patient had coronary heart disease.\nEpidemiological History\nRegarding the source of the infection, 6 patients (23.0%) has a history of travel to Wuhan, with no clear contact with a source of infection. Exact contacts with confirmed or possible patients were found in 18 cases (69.2%), and the contact history was unknown in 2 patients (7.8%). Among patients with a clear source of infection, 10 cases (55.6%) had previously talked to or had a meal with a confirmed COVID-19 patient, and 8 cases (44.4%) lived with a confirmed patient. The sources of infection in these cases included confirmed patients with clinical symptoms (n\u2005=\u200516, 88.8%), a possible COVID-19 patient with clinical symptoms (n\u2005=\u20051, 5.6%), and a confirmed patient without clinical symptoms (n\u2005=\u20051, 5.6%). In addition, 22 cases (84.6%) were found to be correlated with a local cluster. The close contacts of these 26 enrolled patients were traced, and only 2 SARS-CoV-2-infected patients were identified.\nIn the 6 patients with a recent history of travel to Wuhan, the median period from leaving Wuhan to a COVID-19 diagnosis was 16 days (14\u201319 days). In 18 patients with a clear source of infection, the median period from contact with a confirmed or possible case to the confirmed to diagnosis was 19 days (8\u201324 days). This period was longer than 14 days in 14 cases (77.8%) and over 20 days in 4 cases (22.2%) (Figure 1).\nFigure 1.\nOpen in new tabDownload slide\nTimeline of 26 asymptomatic severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 carriers (from contact with or exposure to the infection source/return home from Wuhan to discharge from hospital).\nLaboratory Examinations\nThe initial leukocyte counts were slightly lower than the normal value in 2 patients, slightly higher in 1 patient, and normal in the other patients. The lymphocyte count was normal in 26 patients. Regarding coagulation function, there was an elevated platelet count in 4 patients, higher prothrombin time in 1 patient, and increased D-dimer in 4 patients. Procalcitonin was slightly elevated in 3 cases, all of which were less than 1 ng/mL, and C-reactive protein was normal in 26 patients. In addition, investigations revealed 3 patients with reduced albumin, 4 patients with mildly abnormal transaminase, and 2 patients with slightly elevated creatinine levels. Five patients had slightly lower serum sodium concentration and 1 patient had higher serum potassium concentration. Lactate dehydrogenase and creatine kinase levels were slightly elevated in 3 patients and 1 patient, respectively. There was no statistical significance between the initial and following results for all the above indicators (P\u2005>\u2005.05).\nNucleic Acid Result Change\nBeing SARS-CoV-2-free was defined as 2 consecutive negative nucleic acid results with an interval of at least 24 hours. The period from diagnosis to being confirmed SARS-CoV-2-free was within 10 days in 15 patients, within 20 days in 23 patients, and more than 20 days in 3 patients (20 days, 20 days, and 22 days, respectively). The exact time of contact with a confirmed or possible COVID-19 case was clear in 18 patients. The median period from contact to the last positive COVID-19 nucleic acid test was 21.5 days (10 to 36 days), and in 4 patients this was over 30 days. In a case originating from Wuhan, the period from leaving Wuhan to the last positive COVID-19 nucleic acid test was 35 days (Figure 1). There were positive test results for SARS-CoV-2 after a negative result in 2 patients. In particular, in 1 patient, the SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid tests repeatedly had positive and negative results (Figure 1).\nChest Computed Tomography Characteristics\nChest CT scans were performed an average of 3\u20134 days after the initial CT examination, and each patient had at least 2 CT scans. The results of the first CT scan of the 26 patients were as follows: 9 patients (34.6%) with normal CT scans, 10 patients (38.5%) with typical manifestations (patch-like, ground-glass opacities distributed in the extrapulmonary zone), 7 patients with changes in a unilateral lung, and 3 patients with changes in bilateral lungs. In 7 patients (26.9%), CT scans showed atypical CT manifestations (chronic inflammation and small cord shadows), including a small strip shadows in 3 patients, small nodular shadows in 1 patient, thickened bronchial vascular bundles in 2 patients, and a small manifestation of chronic inflammation in 1 patient.\nIn patients with normal CT scans on admission, the chest CT manifestations did not significantly change during hospitalization, and 7 patients with atypical CT manifestations also showed no significant changes on chest CT scans. For patients with typical chest CT manifestations, improved chest CTs were observed in 7 patients and 3 patients showed improvement after an initial progression of lesions (Figure 2).\nFigure 2.\nOpen in new tabDownload slide\n(A) Chest computed tomography (CT) changes from admission to discharge in case 14 multiple patchy ground-glass opacities can be seen in the right lung on February 6, 2020. (B) The infection progressed more than before on February 11, 2020. (C) On February 16, 2020, the signs of viral pneumonia in the right lung improved slightly, and on February 26, 2020, the chest CT improved (D).\nCorrelations Between Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 Nucleic Acid Changes and Chest Computed Tomography Changes\nPatients with normal or atypical chest CT findings had a relatively short period from diagnosis to continuous negative COVID-19 nucleic acid results, with a median period of 7.5 days (2\u201320 days). In patients with typical patchy or ground-glass opacities, the median period was 12.5 days (8\u201322 days). This difference was statistically significant (P\u2005<\u2005.01). Of the 10 patients with typical chest CT manifestations, 7 patients showed improved chest CT results that synchronized with the negative SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid test result, whereas 3 patients had a marked improvement in CT results without a negative SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid test result.\nEvidence of Dissemination From Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 Carriers\nEvidence 1\nCase 1 was a 30-year-old man who lived in Wuhan, Hubei for a long time. After returning home from Wuhan on January 23, 2020, he lived with his wife, children, and father. His nucleic acid test was positive on February 11, 2020, but there were no clinical symptoms. His chest CT scan showed a few chronic inflammatory changes that were not correlated with COVID-19 infection. His wife, child, and father were examined. Both the wife and child had negative nucleic acid test results. However, his father (case 2) had a positive nucleic acid test result, with no symptoms and no abnormalities in chest CT. Except for case 1, case 2 had no history of contact with any other confirmed or possible COVID-19 patients over the previous 14 days (Figure 3).\nFigure 3.\nOpen in new tabDownload slide\nTransmission evidence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 carriers 1 (Please refer to figure 4 for legend).\nEvidence 2\nCase 3 was a 25-year-old man who lived in Hubei for a long time. He returned home on January 20, 2020, and then lived with his father and mother. The patients had no history of contact with any confirmed or possible COVID-19 patients in the 14 days before diagnosis. On January 25, his mother began to have fever, cough, and chest tightness. Three days later, on January 28, his father began to have fever, cough, sputum, and sore throat. The patients had positive nucleic acid test results on February 3. After the parents were diagnosed, case 3 was hospitalized and isolated for inspection. Case 3 experienced no clinical symptoms throughout this period, although his nucleic acid test result was positive on February 4 and his chest CT showed a slightly increased density in the basal segment of the lower left lung (Figure 4).\nFigure 4.\nOpen in new tabDownload slide\nTransmission evidence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 carriers 2.\nTreatment Strategy\nAll patients were isolated and treated with 1 or more antiviral drugs. Recombinant human alpha-1b interferon nebulized inhalation (5 million U bid for adults and 3 million U bid for children) was administered in 25 cases. Twenty-two patients received oral lopinavir/ritonavir (400 mg/100 mg bid for adults, 200 mg/50 mg qd for children). Five adult patients were treated with oral arbidol (200 mg tid), and 1 patient developed purulent tonsillitis during hospitalization and was treated with antibiotics.\nPrognosis of Asymptomatic Patients With Coronavirus Disease 2019\nOne patient developed nausea during hospitalization, which may have been caused by lopinavir/ritonavir. Another case developed a transient fever, which was related to suppurative tonsillitis. This patient felt better after antibiotic treatment. Neither of the 2 symptoms was associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. The remaining cases were asymptomatic during hospitalization. Discharge criteria for COVID-19 were as follows: (1) normal body temperature for more than 3 days; (2) significantly improved respiratory symptoms; (3) significantly improved chest radiography; and (4) 2 consecutive negative SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid test results (sampling interval at least 1 day). All 26 patients were discharged from the hospital. The period from admission to discharge ranged from 10 to 24 days, with a median of 13 days.\nDiscussion\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, a new coronavirus that recently appeared, has rapidly spread across many countries and regions around the world. This new coronavirus is reported to be more contagious than atypical pneumonia (SARS) and Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome coronavirus [15\u201317]. The clinical symptoms of COVID-19 were mainly mild to moderate disease, but there is still mortality of 3.2% [11]. Isolating sources of infection is an important measure to control this current epidemic [2, 18]. Infected individuals with clinical symptoms can be tracked according to their clinical symptoms, whereas those who are asymptomatic, especially those without an epidemiological history, are difficult to track. These asymptomatic cases may also capable of transmitting SARS-CoV-2, which could cause difficulties in COVID-19 prevention and control. At present, there are few studies of asymptomatic disease, most of which focus on the proportion of asymptomatic patients and the evidence of asymptomatic transmission. The description of clinical features of asymptomatic patients is technically a description of asymptomatic disease at the time of diagnosis, with some patients going on to develop symptoms. There is also little research on asymptomatic epidemiology. The infectiousness and effect of the asymptomatic epidemiological characteristics and disease clinical characteristics of dynamic change are not clear. Therefore, this study focused on persistently asymptomatic cases of COVID-19.\nBy tracing and isolating the contacts of people who were diagnosed or possible COVID-19 patients, this study identified a total of 26 asymptomatic patients. Asymptomatic carriers were found to be of any age, mainly concentrated in the 20- to 60-year age range, and are characterized by local clusters. Disease transmission from 2 asymptomatic patients was included in this study. Infected patients may have clinical symptoms or may be asymptomatic. The study found that asymptomatic cases were mostly infected by symptomatic patients, and a few were infected by asymptomatic patients. Only 2 asymptomatic of the 26 enrolled asymptomatic patients infected others. Therefore, we speculate that asymptomatic carriers may be less infectious than symptomatic patients.\nIn asymptomatic carriers, there was a long period between contact with the infection source to diagnosis, with a median of 19 days. These asymptomatic carriers were identified only when they contacted diagnosed or possible COVID-19 patients, suggesting the difficulty in detecting these asymptomatic carriers. The period from diagnosis to negative nucleic acid test tests was within 20 days for 23 (88.5%) patients (Figure 1). The duration of SARS-CoV-2 infection in asymptomatic patients is unclear. The median period from contact with diagnosed or possible cases to the last positive nucleic acid test was 21.5 days (10\u201336 days). Most patients will miss the real last positive assays because nucleic acid tests for SARS-CoV-2 were not performed every day, so this time might be shorter than the actual time. The period was longer than 30 days in 4 patients, 1 of whom talked with a COVID-19 patient for 1 hour, without contact with any other confirmed or possible patients contacted after that. It was 35 days from the contact of the infectious source to the last positive nucleic test (Figure 1). In addition, this period of 35 days was for a patient with a Wuhan-related history (Figure 1). Therefore, asymptomatic patients may carry SARS-CoV-2 for more than 1 month, suggesting that this virus is carried in asymptomatic patients for a long period.\nIn 2 patients, there was a positive nucleic acid test after an initial negative result, and 1 patient had recurrent alternation of positive and negative results. This phenomenon may be caused by false-negative results of assays, and detection can be affected by factors including the specimens, reagents, and operations. Thus, positive nucleic acid tests cannot be used as the only criterion for COVID-19 diagnosis. Standardized operation and repeated verifications are required to improve the positive rate. Patients with normal chest CTs had a shorter period from diagnosis to being SARS-CoV-2-negative than those with typical CT changes. In some patients, conversion of nucleic acid test results from positive to negative was synchronized with an improvement in chest CT findings, but this change may also occur later than the improvement on CT. Therefore, CT improvement cannot be used to indicate that a patient is not infectious.\nIndices of blood cell counts, liver and renal function, and inflammation in asymptomatic patients did not change significantly during the disease. Reduced lymphocyte and leukocyte counts are characteristics of clinically symptomatic COVID-19, but these changes were not common in the asymptomatic patients in this study. Chest CT in asymptomatic patients can be normal or present with typical ground-glass opacities, usually limited to a unilateral lung but sometimes occurring in bilateral lungs. Three patients with asymptomatic infections developed lung infections during treatment and then improved. Although these asymptomatic patients appear normal, some relatively light damage may have already been produced.\nThis study also has some limitations. For example, only 26 patients were included in this study. In addition, this retrospective analysis did not include daily nucleic acid tests for SARS-CoV-2. Large-scale prospective studies are needed to validate our findings.\nConclusions\nIn summary, asymptomatic infections can occur at any age and appear to be correlated with local clusters of diseases. Asymptomatic transmission may be less contagious but should still be recognized as an infection source for COVID-19 transmission. There were no significant changes in the biochemical and inflammatory variables in these patients. However, changes on chest CT may occur in these patients. It is necessary to note that SARS-CoV-2 can be present for a long time in some asymptomatic patients; the change in nucleic acid test results from positive to negative in some patients may not occur synchronously with the CT improvement; and false negatives of the nucleic acid test for SARS-CoV-2 may occur.\nNotes\nFunding.

We report a 3-family cluster of infections involving asymptomatic and paucisymptomatic transmission. Eight of 15 (53%) members from 3 families were confirmed with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Of 8 patients, 3 were asymptomatic and 1 was paucisymptomatic. An asymptomatic mother transmitted the virus to her son, and a paucisymptomatic father transmitted the virus to his 3-month-old daughter. SARS-CoV-2 was detected in the environment of 1 household. The complete genomes of SARS-CoV-2 from the patients were >\u200999.9% identical and were clustered with other SARS-CoV-2 sequences reported from China and other countries.\nSARS-CoV-2, COVID-2019, asymptomatic, paucisymptomatic, transmission\nTopic: china infections sars-cov-2\nIssue Section: Brief Report\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), emerged in December 2019 in Wuhan, China [1]. It has since been declared a global pandemic with > 2.4 million cases reported as of 22 April 2020 [2]. Person-to-person transmission has been established [3\u20138], and asymptomatic transmission of SARS-CoV-2 has been reported [9]. However, studies on the potential transmission of SARS-CoV-2 by asymptomatic persons and those with mild illness have been limited [10]. Herein, we report a 3-family cluster study of 8 patients associated with asymptomatic and paucisymptomatic (1 with mild symptoms only) SARS-CoV-2 transmission in Shandong Province, China.\nMETHODS\nEpidemiological Investigation\nThe first SARS-CoV-2\u2013positive patients in this cluster were identified on 21 January 2020, triggering an epidemiological investigation by the local Center for Disease Control and Prevention. To identify the possible infective source, the epidemiological investigation focused on exposure history before the onset of illness, such as travel history to Wuhan or Hubei provinces, visiting live animal markets, and contact history with febrile persons. Medical records were also closely reviewed to verify the timelines of events and clarify clinical progressions.\nTo examine possible environmental contamination of SARS-CoV-2 in households, select surfaces that may be frequently touched by family members were sampled in the bedroom (door handle, bedside light switch, and sliding of wardrobe door), kitchen (door handle, faucet handle, light switch, rice cooker plug), and bathroom (door handle, handrail, surface of the toilet bowl, sink). One swab per site (room) with multiple surfaces was collected.\nAll close contacts of SARS-CoV-2\u2013positive patients were traced, including family members who lived with the patients and individuals who had contact with the patients within 1 m without wearing proper personal protection. Close contacts were quarantined at home and monitored for fever (\u2265\u200938\u00b0C) and symptoms. In addition, nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs of close contacts were collected every 24 hours from day 1 to day 14 to detect SARS-CoV-2 by molecular assay. If any close contact had positive detection of SARS-CoV-2, they were sent to a hospital for isolation and treatment.\nSARS-CoV-2 Molecular Detection, Sequencing, and Phylogenetic Analysis\nAll collected environmental and patient samples were stored at \u201380\u00b0C before being transported using cold chain to a Biosafety Level 2 enhanced laboratory to perform molecular detection of SARS-CoV-2. A real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) test kit (GZ-D2RM, Shanghai GeneoDx Biotech Co, Ltd) targeting the ORF1ab and N genes of SARS-CoV-2 was used. A cycle threshold (Ct) value < 37 was interpreted as positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA, and a Ct value of \u2265\u200940 was defined as a negative test. A medium load (weakly positive), defined as a Ct value of 37 to < 40, required confirmation by retesting. Positive samples were sequenced directly from the original specimens as previously described [11]. The maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree of the complete genomes was conducted by using RAxML software (version 8.2.9) [12] with 1000 bootstrap replicates, employing the general time-reversible nucleotide substitution model.\nRESULTS\nDescription of SARS-CoV-2\u2013Positive Patients\nPatient 1 (62-year-old woman) and patient 2 (65-year-old man) were a couple who lived with their son (patient 3), daughter-in-law (patient 4), and 2 grandchildren. Patient 1 presented with cough, rhinorrhea, and sputum on 12 January 2020 (Figure 1). On 15 January, she visited a health clinic and was diagnosed with a common cold. She was prescribed intravenous infusions of ampicillin and sulbactam, ribavirin, and traditional medicine for 5 days. On 16 January, she developed a fever (38\u00b0C). On 17 January, patient 2 reported symptoms of fever (37.8\u00b0C), cough, sputum, earache, and upset stomach. He was also diagnosed with a common cold at the health clinic and received the same prescriptions as patient 1 for 3 days. However, their symptoms did not resolve at the conclusion of the treatment regimen, leading both to seek care at a local hospital on 21 January. NP swabs were collected from both patients at the hospital and confirmed positive for SARS-CoV-2 by rRT-PCR. Thereafter, they were admitted to the isolation ward of the hospital for treatment. Major symptoms during hospitalization for both patients included fever, cough, and fatigue (Figure 1).\nFigure 1.\nOpen in new tabDownload slide\nTimeline of relevant exposures and clinical symptoms of 8 patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection. Abbreviations: rRT-PCR, real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction; SARS-CoV-2, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2.\nPatient 3 (37-year-old man) and patient 4 (35-year-old woman), a young couple, were close contacts of patients 1 and 2. They were self-quarantined at home for 14 days starting on the day of the hospital admission of patients 1 and 2. Their NP swabs were collected on 23 January 2020 for SARS-CoV-2 testing. Patient 3 was confirmed positive that same day for SARS-CoV-2 by rRT-PCR, but had no symptoms. Patient 4 tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 but was later confirmed to be positive for SARS-CoV-2 on 25 January when a repeat NP swab was collected and tested. Upon hospital admission, patient 3 developed a slightly dry and itchy throat. The cough was a major symptom during hospitalization, and 2 days\u2019 fever and 4 days\u2019 fatigue of the total hospital stay were also recorded. Patient 4 had no identified clinical symptoms (Figure 1).\nPatient 5, a 53-year-old woman, lived with her son (patient 6) and parents, and was a close contact of patients 3 and 4, being the mother-in-law of patient 3 and the mother of patient 4. She was self-quarantined at home beginning the day of patient 3\u2019s confirmation (23 January 2020). On 24 January, her NP swab was collected to test for SARS-CoV-2 infection, which was later confirmed positive by rRT-PCR, despite her lack of symptoms. She also did not show any clinical symptoms of infection during hospitalization (Figure 1). Patient 6, a 28-year-old man, was identified as the close contact of his mother (patient 5). He was self-quarantined at home beginning the day of his mother\u2019s (patient 5) confirmed infection (24 January). His NP swab was collected on 25 January and confirmed SARS-CoV-2 positive by rRT-PCR. Upon admission in the afternoon on 25 January, he developed a fever (37.5\u00b0C). Major symptoms during hospitalization included fever and cough, and the symptoms persisted > 2 weeks.\nPatient 7, a 35-year-old man, lived with his wife and 3 children and was identified as the close contact of patient 3. He was self-quarantined at home beginning the day of patient 3\u2019s confirmed infection (23 January 2020). On 25 January, his NP swab was collected and tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by rRT-PCR. During hospitalization, he was paucisymptomatic, with only an occasional cough. Patient 8, a 3-month-old female infant, was the close contact of patient 7, her father. On 27 January, her NP swab was collected and was a weak positive for SARS-CoV-2. A repeat NP swab was collected on 29 January and was positive for SARS-CoV-2. The infant had no clinical symptoms before, during, or after hospitalization.\nThe chest computed tomographic images on admission or hospitalization showed that patients 1\u20136 had ground-glass opacities. However, no significant abnormalities were observed for patients 7 and 8 (Supplementary Figure 1). As of 17 February 2020, all patients recovered and were discharged to home isolation for 14 days.\nExposure Histories\nPatients 1 and 2 traveled to their hometown in Xiaogan from 29 December 2019 to 15 January 2020 (Figure 1). Xiaogan is a city adjacent to the epidemic center of Wuhan and identified the first case on 1 January 2020. Moreover, they had changed trains at the Hankou railway station in Wuhan. Patients 3 and 4 had not traveled to Wuhan. They and their parents live together, eat together, and have frequent face-to-face interactions. Face masks or other personal protective equipment (PPE) were not used at home. Patient 5 had contact with patients 3 and 4 several times at a factory that they jointly operated. Patient 5 also visited the home of patients 1\u20134 on the evening of 21 January and stayed 1 night. On the morning of 22 January, patient 5 was driven home by patient 3. During these contacts, no face masks or other PPE were used. Patient 6 did not report close contact with known COVID-19 cases except for his mother. Patient 7 reported that he had a frequency of contact of 2\u20133 times daily with patient 3 at the factory from 15 to 18 January and dined with patient 3 and other colleagues on 18 January. He did not report close contact with any known COVID-19 cases except for patient 3. Except for contact with her father, patient 8 had no known contact with COVID-19 patients.\nSARS-CoV-2 in Samples From Patients and Environments and Phylogenetic Analysis\nSARS-CoV-2 was detected in NP swabs of all patients during hospitalization, including asymptomatic and paucisymptomatic patients (Figure 1). A total of 15 (5 per household) surface swab samples were collected from the bedrooms (n\u2005=\u20059; 3 per household), kitchens (n\u2005=\u20053; 1 per household), and bathrooms (n\u2005=\u20053; 1 per household) of patient homes. Two of 15 (13.3%) swabs (1 from the bedroom of patient 3 and 1 from his family kitchen) were positive for SARS-CoV-2 by rRT-PCR.\nThe full-genome sequences for 8 patients were obtained and have been deposited in the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID) database (accession numbers EPI_ISL_414934 through 414941). The full genomes for the 2 environmental swabs positive for SARS-CoV-2 were not obtained due to low-coverage genomes. The full genomes of 8 patients were >\u200999.9% identical across the whole genome. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the viruses from patients were clustered in the same clade and were genetically similar to other SARS-CoV-2 sequences reported from China and other countries (Figure 2). No significant mutation site was identified in the 8 SARS-CoV-2 viral sequences compared with previous strains in China and other countries.\nFigure 2.\nOpen in new tabDownload slide\nPhylogenetic analysis of full-length genomes of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in 8 patients. Red text indicates SARS-CoV-2 detected in the patients in the present study.\nClose Contacts\nFifteen contacts of either patient 1 or patient 2 were identified, and 2 contacts (patients 3 and 4) were confirmed with COVID-19. A total of 88 contacts of patient 3 were identified, and 2 contacts (patients 5 and 7) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Seventy-three close contacts of patient 5 were identified, and 1 contact (patient 6) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Two contacts were identified for patient 6 and all tested negative. Twenty-one contacts of patient 7 were identified and 1 contact (patient 8) tested positive. Of 101 close contacts identified for patient 8, all tested negative. No other close contacts of the patients were identified during the 14-day follow-up. Thus, a crude estimation of the attack rate is 3.8% (4/105) for symptomatic and 1% (2/195) for asymptomatic and paucisymptomatic infection.\nDISCUSSION\nWe report a unique 3-family cluster of infection with SARS-CoV-2, in which 8 of 15 members were confirmed with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Particularly interesting is that of 6 secondary patients, 2 were asymptomatic, 1 was paucisymptomatic, and 3 were symptomatic. Our findings show that the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 by individuals with asymptomatic or paucisymptomatic infections is possible. Patients 1 and 2 were likely first exposed to SARS-CoV-2 after visiting their hometown in Xiaogan, Hubei Province, China. Their son (patient 3, symptomatic) and daughter-in-law (patient 4, asymptomatic), whom they live with, were later found to be infected with SARS-CoV-2. Patient 5 (asymptomatic) was identified to be infected with SARS-CoV-2 after frequent contact with patients 3 and 4 during work and home visits. She transmitted the virus to her son (patient 6, symptomatic) whom she lives with. Patient 7 (paucisymptomatic) was found to be infected with SARS-CoV-2 after frequent contact with patient 3 during work. He likely transmitted the virus to his daughter (patient 8, asymptomatic). In addition, consistent with previous studies [5\u20138], the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 during the incubation period of patient 3 likely occurred. Patients 5 and 7 were infected after their exposures to a presymptomatic patient 3 during working or home visits. These findings may help explain the rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2 between persons.\nThe currently available evidence shows that SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted between people through droplets and close contact [13]. A recent study showed extensive environmental contamination by a SARS-CoV-2 patient [14], suggesting the contaminated environment as a potential medium of transmission. In this study, we detected SARS-CoV-2 in 2 environmental swabs from the household of patient 3. Such detection of SARS-CoV-2 in contaminated environments of the household may provide an additional contribution to virus transmission among family members as the virus can remain viable and infectious on the surface up to 7 days [15]. However, the direct research-based evidence describing exactly how SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted is limited, and further studies are required.\nWe cannot rule out the possibility of unknown COVID-19 patients (eg, asymptomatic carriers) transmitting the virus. However, according to screening protocols implemented by the provincial, municipal, and county-level Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, all close contacts were traced, and all patients with positive rRT-PCR results in this study were confirmed by whole-genome sequencing, including those who were asymptomatic or paucisymptomatic (patients 4, 5, 7, and 8).\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe transmission potential by individuals with asymptomatic and paucisymptomatic infection and the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in contaminated environments create challenges in control and prevention for the disease. Further studies are needed to investigate the contribution of persons with asymptomatic or paucisymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection and the relationship with transmission of the virus in the household, occupational, and community settings.\nSupplementary Data\nSupplementary materials are available at The Journal of Infectious Diseases online (http://jid.oxfordjournals.org/).

Like no other event in recent memory, it has demonstrated the resolve and commitment of so many in healthcare. Colleagues in nursing, emergency medicine, and critical care (among many others) deployed to the frontlines, and those in infection control quickly intervened to protect our staff and patients. We, as infectious disease clinicians, have been asked to play our part, as the trusted purveyors of knowledge on the evaluation and management of communicable diseases; from loved ones inquiring about antiviral prophylaxis to calls from colleagues for salvage therapies for worsening pneumonia. For a field of medicine that takes pride on its reliance on evidence and experience, these have been desperate times.\nIn normal times, we make every effort to respond to such requests with evidence-based decision making. In the case of COVID-19, our struggles to reply have not been for a lack of information. Between January 1 and April 12, 2020, there have been 3300 manuscripts indexed in PubMed including the terms \u201cCOVID-19\u201d or \u201cSARS CoV-2,\u201d and another 1552 in medRxiv or bioRxiv (with some duplications between them). However, to date, there has been scant evidence to guide evidence-based clinical decision making. Of the thousands of peer-reviewed articles indexed in PubMed, exactly 1 has reported the results of a randomized controlled trial; a single-centered study with approximately 200 COVID-19-infected individuals, investigating a drug developed for another virus, and resulting in a null finding [1]. As of this writing, there are 52 registered trials for COVID-19 in the United States, but many of these have not yet launched. This abundance of creativity based on strong foundational science has translated so far to only a handful of clinical trials that are currently enrolling, mostly at tertiary care hospitals. We need to do more and faster.\nHowever, this phenomenon is not new to infectious disease clinicians. We are often asked to solve diagnostic and therapeutic dilemmas without the benefit of compelling clinical trial data. We take pride in our clinical acumen (and epic documentation); treating nontuberculous mycobacterial infections and fevers of unknown origin with dizzying cocktails of antebellum drugs or nothing more than the tincture of time. Experience and wisdom matter. Nonetheless, here again, we are knocked off kilter by a disease that has been in existence for less than 6 months, and with its closest equivalents being a blip in the annals of epidemic time in 2003, that only a handful of clinicians saw in person, and a contagion that only some of our grandparents were old enough to experience.\nSo we find ourselves without either of our 2 most reliable supports. To keep ourselves propped up, we have been desperate for information. We have scoured the literature, and the online forums, and the town halls from our own institutions and others. We have all been drinking from the COVID-19 firehose. We are soaked but still thirsty for reliable knowledge. To fill this void, we have sought information in places that, as medical academics, we have not been wont to go previously. Although we agree with ethical obligations that compel medical researchers to make their data publicly available so it can inform the epidemic response, we also remain acutely aware that there has been a corresponding pandemic of COVID-19 misinformation. Indeed, this epidemic has brought an unprecedented supply of rapidly disseminated data that are frequently not peer-reviewed, of variable quality, and, in some cases, retracted altogether. Many of the therapeutic agents proposed in this barrage are toxic, and others are being repurposed for COVID-19 on grand scales, creating shortages for patient populations who depend on them for chronic disease control. Despite all of the unknowns, one thing is clear at this time: none are proven to be beneficial for COVID-19.\nThis is where our test has come and our judgment will follow. Do we reach for this arsenal of unproven medications before we know how to aim? Can we resist the temptation to put our desire to offer guidance to desperate colleagues over our perspicacity about the lack of data in support of these medicines? We confess to failing this challenge more than once over the past few weeks. However, if we can do so, we do have a third strategy in our pockets. One well known to veteran clinicians who have been wrong before and know they will be wrong again: temperance. It is something we do as well as anyone: withdrawing antibiotics, waiting another day or week or month to decide how long their duration needs to be, or, perhaps, never starting them in the first place.\nIn the coming months, there will be results from well designed and peer-reviewed trials that we hope will reveal therapeutic options for the treatment and prevention of COVID-19. Even more likely, there will be at least as many that do not work. In the meantime, we will be asked countless times to help decide which ones are which, often by trusted colleagues in search of a miracle for patients in extremis. In the face of this uncertainty, we can hope that preliminary data from a preprint can provide that miracle, or we can return to first principles and ensure we are reflecting on what the data tell us when asked, simply by responding with the painfully honest truth, \u201cI do not know. Ask me again tomorrow.\u201d\nNotes\nFunding. Mark J. Siedner receives research support from the National Institutes of Health (R01 AI124718).\nPotential conflicts of interest. Rajesh T.

Thousands of health workers have been infected, and outbreaks have occurred in hospitals, aged care facilities, and prisons. The World Health Organization (WHO) has issued guidelines for contact and droplet precautions for healthcare workers caring for suspected COVID-19 patients, whereas the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has initially recommended airborne precautions. The 1- to 2-meter (\u22483\u20136 feet) rule of spatial separation is central to droplet precautions and assumes that large droplets do not travel further than 2 meters (\u22486 feet). We aimed to review the evidence for horizontal distance traveled by droplets and the guidelines issued by the WHO, CDC, and European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control on respiratory protection for COVID-19. We found that the evidence base for current guidelines is sparse, and the available data do not support the 1- to 2-meter (\u22483\u20136 feet) rule of spatial separation. Of 10 studies on horizontal droplet distance, 8 showed droplets travel more than 2 meters (\u22486 feet), in some cases up to 8 meters (\u224826 feet). Several studies of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) support aerosol transmission, and 1 study documented virus at a distance of 4 meters (\u224813 feet) from the patient. Moreover, evidence suggests that infections cannot neatly be separated into the dichotomy of droplet versus airborne transmission routes. Available studies also show that SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in the air, and remain viable 3 hours after aerosolization. The weight of combined evidence supports airborne precautions for the occupational health and safety of health workers treating patients with COVID-19.\nairborne transmission, COVID-19, droplet precautions, mask, respiratory protection\nTopic: centers for disease control and prevention (u.s.) occupational health safety world health organization foot guidelines respiratory secretion precautions airborne transmission sars-cov-2 covid-19\nIssue Section: Review\nThe epidemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was reported to the World Health Organization (WHO) on December 31, 2019 [1], with the number of confirmed cases remaining approximately 40\u201360 until January 20, 2020, when a surge of cases occurred, possibly associated with increased domestic and international travel in China for the Lunar New Year celebration. On January 30, 2020, the number of cases surged to surpass the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic, with cases spreading to over 28 other countries, mostly through travel from China [2]. On March 11, 2020, with more than 118 000 cases spread across 114 countries and 4291 deaths, it was recognized as a pandemic by the WHO [1].\nCoronaviruses (CoVs) are respiratory pathogens, and the SARS-CoV-2 has been identified in both upper and lower respiratory tract samples from patients [3]. Fever, dry cough, malaise, lethargy, shortness of breath, and myalgia are the most common symptoms [2]. Less common symptoms are headache, productive cough, and diarrhea. Mild cases may present with a common cold-like syndrome, whereas severe cases may develop severe acute respiratory distress syndrome and pneumonia. According to the WHO, 21% of cases in China have a severe illness [2]. Early estimates of the reproduction number, R0, give values of approximately 2.2 with a mean incubation period of 5.2 days [4] and a range of up to 24 days. In a recent review, researchers found the average R0 value for COVID-19 to be up to 3.28 and a median value to be approximately 2.79 [5]. In a more recent study, researchers estimated the maximum-likelihood value of R0 to be 2.28 for the Diamond Princess cruise ship [6]. All of these estimates are similar to R0 estimates for SARS [7].\nIn the past epidemics of SARS and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus, healthcare workers (HCWs) have paid a heavy toll. During SARS, HCWs comprised 21% of all cases and in some countries, such as Hong Kong, Singapore, and Canada, more than half of the cases were HCWs, with deaths reported among them [8]. Healthcare worker deaths have already been reported with COVID-19.\nThe WHO has issued guidelines for protection of HCWs that recommend contact and droplet precautions for HCWs caring for suspected COVID-19 patients [9]. Specifically, a medical mask is recommended for routine care, whereas a respirator (airborne precautions) is recommended if HCWs are conducting an aerosol-generating procedure such as endotracheal intubation, bronchoscopy or airway suctioning, along with droplet precautions [9]. Droplet precautions include the recommendation to maintain spatial separation of 1 meter (\u22483 feet) with an infected patient, in the belief that large droplets can only spread horizontally to a maximum of 1 meter (\u22483 feet) [10]. The initial guidelines released by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommended a more precautionary approach, which includes the use of a mask by the patient (source control [11]) and airborne precautions for HCWs [12].\nWe aimed to review the evidence supporting the rule of 1-meter (\u22483 feet) spatial separation for droplet precautions in the context of guidelines issued by the WHO, CDC, and European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) for HCWs on respiratory protection for COVID-19.\nMETHODS\nA systematic review was conducted for evidence of horizontal distance traveled by respiratory droplets, using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) criteria [13]. We used an open date strategy up to March 2020 for searching the literature. The search was made on PubMed and Scopus database, and the search terms used for literature search are as follows: (cough OR sneeze AND droplet AND spread) OR (cough OR sneeze AND droplet AND distance).\nThere are few studies on horizontal spread of droplets in medical journals, so we included original research studies from various science and engineering disciplines, including mathematical, numerical, and experimental studies, published in English language journals. We searched the Scopus database with the same keywords and date strategy for studies published in nonmedical journals. Editorials and reviews were excluded from the review.\nInitial screening of articles was done by 1 reviewer (P.B.). For initial screening, the title and abstract of all the articles were reviewed. Articles were excluded if there is no information on droplet spread. All the articles that were potentially relevant after initial screening were procured in full text. Articles were included for the final review only if it specifically measured the horizontal distance of droplet spread. References of the papers were also included for screening if they fit the inclusion criteria. Four reviewers with expertise in fluid dynamics (P.B., C.D., C.d.S., and L.B.) reviewed the selected articles.\nFor the review, we focused on the following 4 variables among the studies included: (1) type of study, ie, experimental or modeling; (2) methodology used for modeling; (3) use of human subjects for data; and (4) data on extent of horizontal spread. Separate to review of original research evidence for horizontal spread of droplets, the guidelines for respiratory protection issued by the WHO, CDC, and ECDC for SARS, MERS, and COVID-19 coronaviruses were reviewed.\nRESULTS\nWe found 393 papers in the initial search. After reviewing the titles and abstracts, 28 papers were selected for full text review. Finally, 10 papers were included in the review (Figure 1).\nFigure 1.\nOpen in new tabDownload slide\nFlow diagram of literature search.\nEight of the 10 studies discussed a horizontal trajectory greater than 2 meters (\u22486 feet) for a range of droplet sizes of less than 60 \u00b5m [14\u201321]. Seven of 10 studies are based on modeling, and among them the extent of horizontal spread of droplets vary between 2 and 8 meters (\u22486\u201326 feet) [14\u201320], highlighting the different findings between them, which can be partially attributed to the methodologies used. Specifically, 4 of these studies rely on computational fluid dynamics approaches that do not accurately account for the multiphase particle-flow interaction physics [14, 15, 18, 20], and 3 of them model cough as a turbulent jet (continuous ejection with conservation of momentum flux) instead of a turbulent puff (short sudden ejection with conservation of momentum) [15, 18, 20]. The fourth study used Lagrangian modeling for the droplet dispersion, and it was acknowledged that this approach assigns a larger momentum to air hence, making it difficult to translate the results into relevant settings for hospital infection control [14].\nTwo studies used analogous water tank experiments to validate the mathematical modeling developed and reported distances up to 1.4 meters (\u22484.5 feet) and 2.5 meters (\u22488.2 feet) [17, 22]. One of these 2 studies modeled coughs as turbulent jets (continuous emission) [22] despite published contrary evidence showing that the physics of violent exhalations is captured by puffs, sudden high momentum emission of moist and hot air [17].\nIn 5 studies, experiments were performed on human subjects [14, 17, 19, 21, 23], 4 of them generated undisturbed/natural sneezes and coughs, without injestion of fluid or powders by the human subjects [17, 19, 21, 23]. Of 5 studies, 2 used the human subject measurements to develop and validate the mathematical modeling of the droplet dispersal and showed the importance of the exhaled gas cloud of hot and moist air in trapping and extending the range of all droplets [17, 19]. One involved injection of powder in the mouth of the human subject potentially shifting the natural droplet sizes ejected [14]. The other 2 used still photographs [23] and particle counters [21], and the distance reported among these 2 vary from 1 to 3 meters (\u22483\u201310 feet). Table 1 summarizes all the findings, and Figure 2 shows the horizontal distance of droplet spread reported by all the studies.\nTable 1.\nSummary of Studies on Horizontal Spread of Droplets\nAuthor (Year) Type of Study Type of Experiments Type of Modeling Use of Human Subjects (Number of Subjects) Main Findings Regarding Horizontal Distance\nJennison (1942)  Experimental  High-speed illumination for still photography   NA  Yes (not specified)  Majority of respiratory droplets, generated during sneezing, coughing, and talking, are expelled within 1 m (\u22483 ft), the size of the filed of observation.  \nZhu et al (2006)  Experimental and Modeling  Particle image velocimetry  Numerical Modeling   Yes (3)  More than 6.7 mg of saliva was expelled during coughing, at a maximum velocity of 22 m/s during each cough, affecting even area more than 2 m (\u22486.5 ft) away from source. \nXie et al (2007)  Modeling  NA  Numerical Modeling   No  Expelled large droplets (>60 \u00b5m) can travel more than 6 m (\u224820 ft) for sneezing with an exhalation velocity of 50 m/s and more than 2 m (\u22486.5 ft) for coughing at an exhalation velocity of 10 m/s. \nParienta et al (2011)  Modeling  NA  Mathematical Modeling  No  With a coughing velocity of 11.7 m/s droplets with a diameter of 16 \u00b5m can travel a distance more than 7 m (\u224823 ft). \nBourouiba et al (2014)  Experimental and Modeling  High-speed videography of human subject exhalations; Water tank physical experiments for model validation   Mathematical Modeling  Yes (not specified)  Droplets expelled during sneezing and coughing travel within a turbulent gas cloud and examples of ranges, such as that of particle with 30-\u00b5m diameter, which can have a horizontal range of 2.5 m (\u22488 ft). \nWei and Li (2015)  Modeling  NA  Numerical Modeling   No  Relative humidity (RH) plays an important role in the evaporation of the droplets and the distance a droplet can travel.

Guidelines differentiate between high-risk and low-risk situations. High-risk is categorized as situations involving an aerosol-generating procedure, ie, endotracheal intubation, bronchoscopy, open suctioning, administration of nebulized treatment, manual ventilation before intubation, turning the patient to the prone position, disconnecting the patient from the ventilator, noninvasive positive-pressure ventilation, tracheostomy, and cardiopulmonary resuscitation. All other situations are considered low risk. The WHO and CDC recommend respirators to protect from SARS in both low- and high-risk situations [24, 25]. For MERS, WHO recommends masks in low-risk situations and respirators in high-risk situations, CDC recommends respirators in both situations, and ECDC recommends a preassessment of workplace to decide between mask and respirator in low-risk situations and respirators for high-risk situations [26\u201328]. For COVID-19, the WHO recommends masks in low-risk situations and respirators in high-risk situations. The CDC and ECDC initially recommended respirators in both situations, but after personal protective equipment shortages, the CDC downgraded to use of masks in low-risk situations and the ECDC recommended use of mask in case of nonavailability of respirators [29\u201331]. The interim guidelines for COVID-19 appear to assume only droplet and contact spread, and the general risk limit defined for HCWs is 1 meter (\u22483 feet) from the patient [10, 31].\nTable 2.\nThe Use of Masks/Respirators for Coronaviruses: Recommendations From WHO, CDC, and ECDC\nPathogen WHO CDC ECDC\nLow Risk High Riska Low Risk High Risk Low Risk High Risk\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV)  Respiratorb  Respirator  Respirator  Respirator   -  - \nMiddle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV)   Mask  Respirator  Respirator  Respirator   Mask/Respiratorc  Respirator \nSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)  Mask  Respirator  Mask  Respirator  Mask/Respiratord  Respirator \nAbbreviations: CDC, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; ECDC, European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention; WHO, World Health Organization.\naHigh risk are the situations involving an aerosol-generating procedure, ie, endotracheal intubation, bronchoscopy, open suctioning, administration of nebulized treatment, manual ventilation before intubation, turning the patient to the prone position, disconnecting the patient from the ventilator, noninvasive positive-pressure ventilation, tracheostomy, and cardiopulmonary resuscitation.\nbN/R/P 95/99/100 or FFP 2/3 or an equivalent national manufacturing standard (NIOSH [N, R, P 95, 99, 100] or European CE EN149:2001 [FFP2, FFP3] and EN143:2000 [P2] or comparable).\ncNo clear recommendation.

Given the presence of SARS-CoV-2 viral loads in both the lower and upper respiratory tract [3], as well as the persistence of the virus in the air 3 hours after aerosolization in laboratory settings [33], airborne transmission is possible. A recent study showed that seasonal CoVs were more commonly emitted in aerosols than in droplets, even through normal tidal breathing [34]. It is timely to review the evidence informing the 1- to 2-meter (\u22483\u20136 feet) rule of infection control, which drives guidelines for droplet precautions. Most studies of horizontal transmission of droplets show distances of greater than 2 meters (\u22486 feet). The maximum distance recorded in the few available studies is 8 meters (\u224826 feet) [19, 35]. We note that although the studies used very different methodologies and should be interpreted cautiously, they still confirm that the spatial separation limit of 1 meter (\u22483 feet) prescribed for droplet precautions, and associated recommendations for staff at ports of entry [10], are not based on current scientific evidence.\nThe horizontal distance of droplet spread depends on various factors such as viscoelasticity of the expiration fluid, type of ventilation, velocity of expiration, rate of evaporation, and the dynamics of turbulent cloud generated during exhalations, sneezing, or coughing [15, 17\u201319]. The 1- to 2-meter (\u22483\u20136 feet) limit is based on very limited epidemiologic and simulated studies of some selected infections [36]. Some studies cite Jennison [23] as the evidence in support of the 1- to 2-meter (\u22483\u20136 feet) risk limit. This study used high-speed exposure to capture still photographs of the atomizing secretions generated by human sneezing, coughing, and talking, imaged very close to the mouth. It was concluded that the distance to which the majority of droplets were expelled is 2\u20133 feet (\u22481 meter), but no details were provided about how they reached this conclusion. The study acknowledges that the motion picture film used for the experiments was not sensitive enough to capture all the droplets. The lighting technique used inherently selects for the largest sizes of droplets and fluid ligaments, not capturing the rest of the emissions and gas cloud carrying them. The author used still photographs, in which many droplets move out of focus and become unrecordable very quickly, especially using photographic technology from the 1940s. More recent studies have shown the extent of droplet spread to be greater than 2 meters (\u22486 feet) [16\u201321, 35], and that infection risk exists well beyond the recommended range of spatial separation.\nFurthermore, there is no agreement on the definition of \u201cdroplet\u201d route of transmission. There is some agreement that particles with diameters less than 5 \u00b5m are airborne particles, but there is significant variation in the literature when it comes to the classification of the lower size limit of droplets. Wells [37] considered 100 \u00b5m as the cutoff limit for the droplet route. However, later studies considered a cutoff particle diameter of more than 10 \u00b5m to more than 100 \u00b5m [14, 15, 20]. The WHO uses a cutoff limit of 5 \u00b5m to differentiate between aerosols (\u22645 \u00b5m) and droplet (>5 \u00b5m) [38] transmission routes. However, even particles with a diameter of more than 10 \u00b5m can remain airborne long enough to not fall under the framework of classification of \u201cdroplet\u201d route [39]. In addition, the size of a droplet is dynamic and changes within seconds during the transit from the respiratory tract to the environment due to evaporation [39]. A large droplet expelled during coughing or sneezing can become an airborne particle in less than 1 second [39], and that timescale changes depending on the cloud dynamics of exhalation [17, 19]. Hence, it is not possible to characterize droplet and airborne spread as separate, mutually exclusive modes of transmission, and further studies of the risks accounting for combined ambient conditions and patient exhaled cloud are needed.\nIndeed, another important consideration is the effect of temperature, relative humidity, ventilation, etc on the extent of droplet spread, which has been examined by only a few studies. To summarize, they have shown that relative humidity plays an important role in the evaporation of the droplets and the distance a droplet can travel. They report that as the relative humidity increases, the extent of droplet spread decreases [18, 20], yet the horizontal range of the cloud propelling the drops was found to increase with an increase in relative humidity, due to the role of buoyancy of the exhaled cloud [17]. For droplets less than 20 \u00b5m in diameter, local airflow field due to body heat is an important factor in determining the extent of spread because it can lift the droplets upwards into the breathing zone [40]. Studies have also shown that depending on the flow direction and airflow pattern, increasing ventilation rate can effectively reduce the risk of long-range, airborne transmission [41]. Most patients spend the majority of time in normal breathing and can saturate the room air with airborne particles expelled during breathing. Moreover, despite negative pressure isolation conditions, airflow due to door motion can cause breakdown in isolation conditions and as a result pathogen can escape the room, and there is a probability of infection spread outside the room [42]. In general, recent studies show distances reached by potentially pathogen-laden droplets of a continuum of sizes to be far greater than 2 meters (\u22486 feet) [16\u201320]; therefore, the probability of infection well beyond the defined risk limit can be significant. For example, SARS was classified as predominantly transmitted through contact and droplet modes, but aerosolized transmission well beyond 2 meters (\u22486 feet) was reported in the Amoy Gardens outbreak [32].\nThe ability of countries to respond effectively depends on the safety and confidence of the health workforce, especially in low-income countries with low ratios of HCWs per head of population, and protective measures are crucial to ensure a functional health workforce. We have previously shown that masks do not have clinical efficacy against respiratory infections [43, 44], and that intermittent use of respirators (which depends on HCWs to assess their own risk and use the device when they judge they are at risk) is as equally ineffective as mask use [44]. A recent trial confirmed there is no difference between targeted respirator use and surgical mask use, but it did not have a control arm and so it may have shown equal efficacy or inefficacy [45]. Proven efficacy of a respirator is seen when the device is worn continually during the shift [43]. The SARS-CoV-2 has been found in both upper and lower respiratory tract specimens, often early in the upper and later in the lower respiratory tract [3], which means it can potentially be dispersed in fine, airborne particles. Influenza studies show that in a busy emergency department or hospital ward, airborne particles with viable virus can persist for hours in the air [46]. A study of SARS-CoV-2 in a hospital in Wuhan found virus at least 4 meters (\u224813 feet) within a hospital ward, and virus was identified in air samples and on multiple air outlet vents [47]. Other studies have also found SARS-CoV-2 on air vents in a patient room [48]. Another study found virus to be viable in air samples 3 hours after aerosolization in laboratory settings [33]. We have also shown that airborne precautions are more efficacious in protecting HCWs even against infections assumed to be spread by the droplet route [49]. This further supports the conclusion that transmission cannot be neatly separated into droplet versus airborne routes, and that it is likely driven by both airborne, and large droplets, carried by the respiratory gas cloud. In light of the lack of definitive transmission data for SARS-CoV-2, as well as persistence of the virus in the air 3 hours after aerosolization in laboratory settings [33], the precautionary principle in the initial CDC guidance was justified. This includes use of a mask by the patient, for which the limited evidence is supportive [11]. Guidelines should be precautionary in ensuring protection of the occupational health and safety of health workers treating COVID-19 [50]. Although the majority of the studies reviewed point towards horizontal spread of more than 2 meters (\u22486 feet), these results cannot be translated directly to hospital settings, because the studies used a varying range of assumptions. The recent data on SARS-CoV-2 in a hospital ward shows a distance traveled by the virus of at least 4 meters (\u224813 feet), double the assumed safe distance [47].\nConclusions\nThis review reveals the limited scientific data to inform spatial separation guidelines and a growing body of evidence that droplet precautions are not appropriate for SARS-CoV-2. Hence, future work on carefully documenting and studying the mechanisms shaping transmission distances are warranted, particularly with experiments over a large number of subjects and a variety of conditions, to update current spatial separation guidelines and the current paradigm of droplet and airborne respiratory transmission routes.\nNotes\nFinancial support.

Here we describe the epidemiology of seasonal CoVs (sCoVs) and other cocirculating viruses in the West of Scotland, United Kingdom. We analyzed routine diagnostic data for >70 000 episodes of respiratory illness tested molecularly for multiple respiratory viruses between 2005 and 2017. Statistical associations with patient age and sex differed between CoV-229E, CoV-OC43, and CoV-NL63. Furthermore, the timing and magnitude of sCoV outbreaks did not occur concurrently, and coinfections were not reported. With respect to other cocirculating respiratory viruses, we found evidence of positive, rather than negative, interactions with sCoVs. These findings highlight the importance of considering cocirculating viruses in the differential diagnosis of COVID-19. Further work is needed to establish the occurrence/degree of cross-protective immunity conferred across sCoVs and with COVID-19, as well as the role of viral coinfection in COVID-19 disease severity.\nSARS-CoV-2, Acute respiratory infections, Disease surveillance, Coinfection, Virus-virus interactions\nTopic: epidemiology coronavirus immunity scotland viruses coinfection covid-19\nIssue Section: Major Article\nIn March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the global spread of coronavirus (CoV) disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by a human CoV (severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV [SARS-CoV-2]) that emerged in China in December 2019, a pandemic [1]. Predicting the public health impact of pathogens with recently acquired human-to-human transmissibility is a challenge. Currently, the fate of COVID-19 remains unclear; understanding the likely age and seasonal profiles of infection risks will be critical to inform effective surveillance and control strategies.\nDuring the early phase of an outbreak, in the absence of detailed country-specific knowledge, preliminary risk estimates may be gauged from endemic pathogens with similar modes of transmission. The infection incidence and levels of severe illness associated with COVID-19 remains unclear. In this instance, epidemiological data on seasonal CoVs (sCoVs) may provide valuable information about individuals and seasonal conditions favoured by, or limiting, an invading CoV.\nTo date, emergent zoonotic human CoVs associated with high case-fatality ratios have not achieved persistence in the human population. SARS-CoV emerged in 2002 and spread rapidly around the globe before being successfully contained in 2003 [2]. Conversely, Middle East respiratory syndrome CoV has continued to cause sporadic cases predominantly in healthcare settings since its discovery in 2012, but has not demonstrated sustained community transmission [3]. In contrast, CoV-229E, CoV-NL63, CoV-OC43, and CoV-HKU1 are common cocirculating sCoVs predominantly associated with mild infection of the upper respiratory tract [4].\nA key determinant governing the invasion and persistence success of a new pathogen is the abundance of susceptible hosts. Such population susceptibility may be difficult to define owing to preexisting cross-protective immunity in individuals previously exposed to antigenically related pathogens, as demonstrated for pandemic influenza A H1N1 in 2009 [5]. Furthermore, the potential for heterologous interactions among taxonomically broad groups of respiratory viruses is also recognized [6\u201311]. A good epidemiological understanding of cocirculating viruses will provide valuable information on the potential for immune, or otherwise mediated, virus-virus interactions and the consequences for population susceptibility.\nTo date, epidemiological knowledge surrounding sCoVs has been limited for many settings owing to their historic association with mild illness. However, some laboratories have adopted sCoV testing as part of routine multiplex diagnostic screens [12\u201315], following an increased recognition of the associated disease spectrum. Our group previously reported on the comparative epidemiological characteristics of acute viral respiratory infections, and the potential for virus-virus interactions, based on multiplex reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing in the West of Scotland [6, 16]. In the current article, we provide further detail on sCoVs differentiated at the species level (sCoV types) over an extended time frame and discuss key potential implications for COVID-19 virus emergence in Scotland, United Kingdom.\nMETHODS\nThe Study Population\nRoutine molecular testing for CoV-229E, CoV-OC43, and CoV-NL63 using multiplex real-time reverse-transcription PCR methods was conducted between 1 January 2005 and 30 September 2017 by the West of Scotland Specialist Virology Centre in NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde, the largest Scottish National Health Service (NHS) board serving a population of approximately 1.2 million [17]. The respiratory virus screen also simultaneously detected influenza A virus, influenza B virus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), human adenoviruses (AdVs), human rhinoviruses, human metapneumovirus, and parainfluenza virus (PIV) types 1\u20134. The CoV-HKU1 assay was discontinued in 2012 owing to low levels of detection. Most clinical specimens (91%) were obtained from the upper respiratory tract (the majority being nasal and/or throat swab samples).\nDuring the study period, 107 174 clinical respiratory samples, from 64 948 individual patients, were received by the West of Scotland Specialist Virology Centre for testing. For patients with \u22652 samples submitted (24.5% of patients), the PCR test data were aggregated into individual episodes, defined as a 30-day period from the collection date of the first sample. This generated 84 957 episodes of respiratory illness for analysis. Most episodes, 93% that occurred out with the 3 major waves of pandemic influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus circulation in the United Kingdom (summer 2009 and influenza seasons of 2009\u20132010 and 2010\u20132011), were tested for all 11 groups of respiratory virus. Of 84 957 episodes of respiratory illness, 10 438 were not tested for CoV (98% during the 3 major waves of pandemic influenza) and thus were excluded from analyses centered on sCoVs [18]. Among the remaining 74 519 episodes of illness, another 278 were either tested for CoV-HKU1 or the CoV was untyped; these episodes were excluded from analyses differentiating sCoV type. See Figure 1 for a summary of the data subsets.\nFigure 1.\nOpen in new tabDownload slide\nData flow diagram summarizing patient subsets informing each analysis. Samples from 64 948 patients were subjected to molecular tested for respiratory viruses, performed with real-time multiplex reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction in NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Scotland, United Kingdom, between 1 January 2005 and 30 September 2017. Abbreviation: sCoV, seasonal coronavirus.\nStatistical Modeling Analyses\nOf 74 241 patient episodes of respiratory illness with sCoV subtyping, 8912 patients experienced multiple episodes over the study time frame. In such cases, we retained the first observed episode to remove patient-level clustering, leaving 56 276 patient observations for analysis (Figure 1). We used multivariable logistic regression to investigate associations between sCoV types (CoV-229E, CoV-OC43, and CoV-NL63) and patient age (categorical), sex (binary), healthcare service setting (binary; primary or secondary or tertiary services), time period with respect to the 3 major waves of pandemic influenza in the United Kingdom (categorical; prepandemic, January 2005 to April 2009; pandemic, May 2009 to February 2011; and postpandemic, March 2011 to September 2017) and season (categorical). Statistical interactions between patient covariates and healthcare service setting were assessed. An \u03b1 level of 5% was used to determine statistical significance of all model coefficients. The fitted models, incorporating age-healthcare service interactions, were used to generate average predicted probabilities of virus detection by age and healthcare setting.\nIn addition, we used multivariable logistic regression to investigate interactions between each sCoV and other groups of respiratory viruses at the within-host scale. These analyses were based on 16 991 virus-positive episodes of respiratory illness, retaining the first observed episode of illness for patients with multiple episodes. Virus-negative patients were excluded to eliminate the influence of Berkson bias, which may lead to spurious inference of disease-disease associations when these are estimated from routine healthcare data [19]. Specifically, these analyses tested whether the odds of a given virus (\u201cexposed\u201d) coinfecting with a given sCoV differed from the average odds among the remaining groups of viruses (\u201cnonexposed\u201d), thereby assessing nonrandom mixing among the virus population.\nThree models were fitted, one each for CoV-229E, CoV-OC43, and CoV-NL63 (response variables). The analyses adjusted for patient age, sex, healthcare service setting, time period with respect to pandemic influenza (as described above), and the monthly background prevalence of the sCoV (response variable) to eliminate spurious virus-virus associations owing to unrelated sources of seasonality. Holm\u2019s method was used to correct P values for multiple comparisons (10 virus-virus interaction hypotheses per model) [20].\nAll analyses were conducted using R software version 3.4.4 [21]. Logistic regression modeling was conducted using the \u201cglm\u201d function, and predicted probabilities were computed using \u201cggaverage\u201d from the \u201cggeffects\u201d package [22].\nRESULTS\nPrevalence of sCoVs Among People With Respiratory Illness\nAmong 84 957 episodes of respiratory illness, 79.0% were sampled at secondary or tertiary healthcare services (hospital inpatients and outpatients), and 21.0% from primary healthcare services (general practice [GP]). The sex distribution was approximately equal, with 51.6% of patients female, and the median age was 33.1 years (interquartile range, 5.6\u201359.1 years).\nThe prevalence of sCoV detections overall was 4.0% among tested patients (2958 of 74 519), contributing to 10.7% (2958 of 27 734) of all respiratory virus detections. Figure 2 summarizes the contribution of sCoVs to the total viral detections in the patient population during each influenza season (October\u2013May) from 2005 to 2016. The most common virus detections during influenza seasons among virus-positive patients were human rhinoviruses (range, 15.3%\u201346.2%), influenza viruses (13.4%\u201334.0%, excluding pandemic influenza waves of 2009\u20132010 and 2010\u20132011), and RSV (10.1%\u201321.9%), followed by sCoVs (7.7%\u20137.4%) (Figure 2).\nFigure 2.\nOpen in new tabDownload slide\nPercentages of viral respiratory infections attributed to human coronaviruses and other common respiratory viruses during each influenza season (October\u2013May) from 2005\u20132006 until 2016\u20132017, based on 84 957 episodes of respiratory illness. Influenza includes influenza A and influenza B viruses combined; and \u201cother\u201d includes human adenoviruses, human metapneumovirus, and parainfluenza viruses type 1\u20134. Note: Years of major pandemic influenza A H1N1 virus circulation (2009\u20132010 and 2010\u20132011) must be viewed with caution, owing to high levels of partial testing. Testing for CoV-HKU1was discontinued in 2012. Abbreviations: CoV, human coronaviruses (CoV-229E, CoV-OC43, CoV-NL63, and CoV-HKU1 combined); RSV, respiratory syncytial virus; RV, human rhinovirus.\nNumbers of sCoV detections increased before pandemic influenza (March 2011 to September 2017), likely owing to enhanced virological testing of acute respiratory illnesses; the overall number of sCoV detections rose from 545 before, to 2072 following the pandemic influenza period. However, a decrease in prevalence among the tested population was observed, from 4.27% to 3.70%, and with varying patterns at the individual sCoV level (Supplementary Table 1). The most prevalent detection was CoV-OC43, both before and following the pandemic influenza period (Supplementary Table 1). CoV-HKU1 was present at a very low prevalence of 0.3% overall (124 of 36 652 episodes tested until the assay was discontinued in 2012) and was therefore excluded from further analyses.\nDifference Between Patients in Detection of sCoVs\nDespite more sCoV detections in the hospital setting, the prevalence was greatest among the tested GP attendees (5.3%; 673 of 12 670) than among those in hospitals (3.7%; 2285 of 61 849). Figure 3 summarizes the age distributions. Cases of sCoV in children <5 years old and the elderly (>64 years) were disproportionately represented among patients admitted to the hospital, compared with a more uniform distribution among GP attendees, closely following the overall tested population (Figure 3A). Different sex biases was found among adults depending on the healthcare setting, with more female patients in primary care versus more male patients in secondary or tertiary care (Figure 3B). This pattern was consistent when comparing the percentages of detections among sCoV-positive patients across sCoV types: 59.2% (CoV-229E), 55.6% (CoV-OC43), and 59.8% (CoV-NL63) of cases detected in primary care were in female patients, whereas 54.7% (CoV-229E), 51.1% (CoV-OC43), and 56.7% (CoV-NL63) cases detected in secondary or tertiary care were in male patients (Supplementary Table 2).\nFigure 3.\nOpen in new tabDownload slide\nAge distributions of general practice (GP; primary care) and hospital (secondary/tertiary care) patients tested and positive for human coronavirus (CoV), (A) and percentages of female patients (B). Note the different y-axis scale for CoV cases in A. Hospital patients include inpatients and outpatients.\nThe median patient age (interquartile range) varied from 20.9 (2.7\u201350.2) years for CoV-NL63, to 39.9 (5.0\u201362.5) and 43.3 (16.5\u201360.4) years for CoV-OC43 and CoV-229E, respectively. The age-specific prevalences of sCoVs among the tested population are summarized in Supplementary Tables 3 and 4. More variation across ages was found in primary care patients for CoV-229E (coefficient of variation, 40.4%) and CoV-NL63 (33.8%) than for CoV-OC43 (13.6%), with less variation for patients in secondary or tertiary care (CV, 29.96% for CoV-229E, 28.0% for CoV-NL63, and 17.10% for CoV-OC43).\nStatistical modeling analyses further confirmed differences in age and sex associations according to sCoV type, and a greater chance of sCoV detection among GP attendees than among patients admitted to the hospital (Supplementary Tables 5\u20137). No evidence of significant effect modification between patient age or sex and healthcare service setting was found (statistical interaction terms, P > .05; results not shown). Figure 4 summarizes average age-specific predicted probabilities with statistical interactions incorporated. In summary, we observed a trend toward increasing probability of CoV-229E with age (Figure 4A), greater probabilities of CoV-OC43 at the extremities of age (Figure 4B), and decreasing probability of CoV-NL63 with age (Figure 4C). These age patterns were broadly consistent across patient sex and healthcare settings, although we note that 95% confidence intervals overlapped across all ages except for patients in the hospital setting. A borderline significant sex effect was found for CoV-229E, with detections more likely among male patients (Supplementary Table 5).\nFigure 4.\nOpen in new tabDownload slide\nAverage age-specific predicted probabilities of human coronavirus (CoV) detections by patient sex and healthcare service setting ( general practice [GP; primary care] or hospital [inpatients and outpatients; secondary or tertiary care]). Data were derived from multivariable logistic regression models incorporating statistical interactions between patient age and healthcare service (see Supplementary Tables 5\u20137 for model results without statistical interactions).\nVariations in Seasonality Among sCoVs\nFigure 5 shows the monthly prevalences of sCoVs detected among the patient population. These are winter pathogens in the United Kingdom, peaking on average between January and March. However, there were notable variations between sCoV types and between years. Overall, CoV-OC43 was the most prevalent detection among the tested population in each influenza season. Differences were also observed in periodicities; before the first wave of pandemic influenza in 2009, CoV-229E peaked biennially, but it subsequently exhibited longer interpeak periods, particularly between 2013 and 2016.\nFigure 5.\nOpen in new tabDownload slide\nMonthly prevalence of seasonal coronaviruses (sCoVs) detected among patients with respiratory illness virologically tested in NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Scotland, United Kingdom, between January 2005 and September 2017.

A considerable degree of synchrony is observed in the timing of the peak prevalence of CoV-OC43 and CoV-NL63 for most seasons, whereas CoV-229E was more distinctive in its temporal pattern. For example, low levels of CoV-229E in 2007 coincided with high magnitudes of CoV-OC43 and CoV-NL63, whereas the high prevalence of CoV-229E in 2010 coincided with low magnitudes of CoV-OC43 and CoV-NL63.\nInteractions Between sCoVs and Other Respiratory Viruses\nThe cocirculation of sCoVs with other common respiratory virus raises the potential for ecological interactions, altering infection risks and the dynamics of population transmission. Our data did not permit analysis of potential within-host interactions among different sCoVs because of an absence of sCoV coinfections, but we did evaluate the potential for within-host interactions between sCoVs and other common respiratory viruses.\nTo do so, we analyzed the nonrandom mixing of respiratory viruses among virus-positive patients using multivariable logistic regression. We found a greater propensity for CoV-OC43 to coinfect with RSV (odds ratio, 1.68; 95% confidence interval, 1.05\u20132.63; uncorrected P = .03), AdV (2.93; 1.87\u20134.5, uncorrected P < .001), and PIV3 (2.38; 1.28\u20134.17; uncorrected P = .004) (Supplementary Table 8). The associations with AdV and PIV3 were supported after correction of P values for multiple comparisons (P < .001 and P = .04 respectively).\nNo evidence of interactions with other respiratory viruses was found for either CoV-229E or CoV-NL63. Assessment of PIV types was limited by small numbers of coinfections; these viruses were aggregated at the genus level for the CoV-229E analysis, and PIV2 was excluded from the CoV-NL63 analysis. See Supplementary Tables 9 and 10 for details and Supplementary Figure 1 for a summary. The finding for PIVB (parainfluenza virus types 2 and 4 combined; the human rubulavirus genus) must be treated with caution, because the 95% confidence interval overlaps 1. The average age-specific predicted probabilities of sCoV coinfection for individuals with or without coinfection with each specific respiratory virus are given in Supplementary Table 11.\nDISCUSSION\nThe likely long-term impact of the recently emerged COVID-19 is a topic currently shrouded in uncertainty for countries worldwide. At the time of writing, global cases are mounting, with evidence of community transmission for a growing number of countries. In the absence of setting-specific data, an epidemiological understanding of related and unrelated cocirculating pathogens is prudent to guide preliminary estimates of who is at risk and when, and to develop research priorities pertaining to population susceptibility. Epidemiological knowledge of sCoVs is lacking for many settings owing to an absence of inclusion in routine diagnostic testing. Here, we described several key epidemiological features of sCoVs based on a unique data set derived from multiplex PCR diagnostic testing of a large, well-defined population, over a 13-year period.\nIt is well known that sCoVs cocirculate endemically with other common respiratory viruses, and coinfections are frequently observed [11, 12, 16]. In the West of Scotland, sCoVs typically peak in winter months alongside influenza viruses and RSV, as described elsewhere [12]. The common occurrence of sCoVs during periods of high influenza activity highlights the importance of considering these viruses in the differential diagnosis of viral respiratory infections. This is particularly pertinent in the context of COVID-19 emergence; cocirculating viruses are associated with a broad spectrum of clinical presentation overlapping that of COVID-19, raising the potential for a large number of undiagnosed or misclassified cases in settings lacking the capacity for multiplexed testing. Currently in NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Scotland, most COVID-19 testing is being conducted in the hospital setting, where severe cases of respiratory illness and high risk groups are simultaneously tested with a multiplex panel.\nSex-specific numbers of sCoV differed by healthcare setting; we observed a trend toward female patients with sCoV for primary care, but male patients for secondary or tertiary care. This finding may reflect sex differences in healthcare-seeking behaviors and/or illness severity. In terms of sex differences in detection odds (a proxy for infection and/or severity risk), a statistically significant sex effect was found for CoV-229E, with a greater odds among male than among female patients. This finding is consistent with previous reports of a male bias for CoV-OC43 and CoV-NL63 in the hospital setting [12], and in relation to influenza hospitalizations and mortality rates for acute respiratory infections more generally [23, 24]. It has been proposed that differences in sex hormones may explain variation in respiratory infection susceptibility, with testosterone exerting an immunosuppressive effect in male and estrogen playing a protective role in female [25, 26]. We note, however, that our analyses did not control for the potential confounding or effect modifying role of comorbid conditions, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and asthma, or lifestyle factors, such as smoking.\nA greater number of sCoV cases were observed in children <5 years of age and in elderly persons, particularly among patients admitted to hospital. This pattern is consistent with overall testing trends and may therefore reflect the healthcare-seeking behavior of concerned parents, clinician testing practices, and/or the burden of other respiratory agents, rather than a greater risk of infection. However, it should be borne in mind that these analyses were based on a patient population; the true community burden of mild and/or asymptomatic infections is likely to be much higher [27]. When aggregated into epidemiological groupings, age-specific probabilities of virus detection varied across sCoV types.\nIn contrast to what is generally observed for sCoVs, relatively few COVID-19 cases have been reported thus far in children [28]. In the context of our study population, COVID-19 is closely related to CoV-OC43 (both betacoronaviruses), the most prevalent sCoV detected among patients <5 years old. It is possible that preexisting cross-immunity confers protection and/or attenuates the severity of COVID-19, leading to fewer tested and hospitalized children. The comparatively lower proportion positive and detection odds for school-aged compared with younger children may potentially reflect a sustained level of CoV-OC43 immune-mediated protection, whereas waned immunity is expected to leave adults more vulnerable to CoV infection [28]. Assuming some degree of cross-immunity with sCoVs, our data are consistent with fewer expected cases of COVID-19 in children but more among the adult population [29, 30]. In addition, immunosenescence may exacerbate low levels of protective immunity in elderly persons [30, 31].\nThree key features of our data seemingly support the proposition of cross-immunity. First, the contrasting age patterns of detection probabilities between closely related CoV-229E and CoV-NL63 (both alphacoronaviruses) may reflect niche segregation. Second, closely related CoV-229E and CoV-NL63 also displayed asynchronous seasonality, in contrast to CoV-OC43 and CoV-NL63, supporting a competition dynamic. Although our data did not permit in-depth analysis of CoV-HKU1, others have reported differences in the timing of peak detections with CoV-OC43 (both betacoronaviruses) [12]. Third, coinfections among sCoVs were not recorded in this study population, although detected by others albeit at a very low frequency [12]. More work is needed to establish whether low coinfection frequency among sCoVs supports an immune-mediated competition for hosts, or whether this reflects a limitation of diagnostic data that capture only a snapshot of an individual\u2019s infection.\nTo our knowledge, evidence of immunological cross-protection between human CoVs is lacking, and reports of antigenic cross-reactivity are inconsistent. The potential for serological cross-reactivity between SARS-CoV and sCoVs has been shown by some [31, 32] but not others [33]. Moreover, although confinement of cross-reactivity at the CoV genus level is possible, consistent with the greater genetic relatedness of these viruses [34, 35], more general cross-reactivity between CoV-OC43 and CoV-229E has also been found [36]. Population serological surveys will be critical for establishing the true burden and age distribution of sCoV infections in the community and the potential for cross-protective immunity.\nIt should be borne in mind that the implications of population levels of cross-immunity are likely to vary according to the local epidemiological context. We note the predominance of CoV-OC43 detections previously observed in a comparatively urban but different Scottish patient population [14], a pattern more generally consistent at the Scottish national level [28]. Other trends observed within our study population are consistent with the Scottish national level, such as peak levels of CoV-229E detection in 2010 coinciding with low levels of CoV-NL63 and CoV-OC43 [28]. A predominance of CoV-OC43 has also been observed in Sweden [16], suggesting a potential consistency in sCoV dominance over wider geographic areas. However, differences are also apparent, for example, the relatively common detection of CoV-HKU1 in a different Scottish population [14], as also suggested in a recent report on respiratory virus detections in France [29].\nOur study also highlights the potential for interactions between sCoVs and other respiratory viruses. In previous extensive analyses of virus-virus interactions, our group found a strong signal of positive interactions at the within-host scale between human CoVs overall and RSV, AdV, and PIVs (combining types 1 and 3; human Respirovirus genus) [6]. In the current study, our more in-depth analysis corroborates positive interactions at the sCoV type level. For CoV-OC43, the most prevalent in this study population, our results support our group\u2019s earlier findings of a higher propensity of coinfection with RSV, AdV, or PIV3 than with other respiratory viruses. Note that these analyses were based on routine diagnostic testing, so the directionality of effects could not be determined. The association with RSV was not supported after a correction for multiple comparisons, although previous studies also showed a high proportion of sCoV coinfections with RSV [12, 37]. The role of viral coinfections in the severity of acute respiratory illness remains controversial [29\u201333]. Further work is needed to establish the role of viral coinfections in COVID-19 severity.\nIn conclusion, the public health impact of COVID-19 is likely to vary according to the epidemiological context and healthcare infrastructure of the population. Our findings suggest that continued monitoring of cocirculating respiratory viruses will be important for guiding accurate case ascertainment and research priorities surrounding population susceptibility, and for assessing the comparative population and healthcare burden of COVID-19 in the context of multiple cocirculating respiratory pathogens. Further work is needed to identify the mechanism of interactions between human CoVs and other respiratory viruses, and the role of viral coinfections in the severity and burden of COVID-19.\nSupplementary Data\nSupplementary materials are available at The Journal of Infectious Diseases online.

I was one of the last students at Johns Hopkins University with an in-person defense, surrounded by family, friends, colleagues, and mentors. Soon after, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) released guidelines discouraging the gathering of more than 50 people in one place. Three weeks later\u2014on the day I was scheduled to start the clinical portion of my medical training\u2014there were 418 700 confirmed cases of COVID-19 globally [1]. By that time, many courses had started remote instruction, most research laboratories had been closed to all nonessential personnel, and medical school core clerkships had been temporarily canceled, all in an effort to decrease student exposure to COVID-19 and help \u201cflatten the curve.\u201d\nStuck between the 2 phases of my training as an MD/PhD candidate, I could not help but reflect on my future in the healthcare field. As a newly minted scientist specializing in microbiology and genomics, the biology of the virus immediately captured my attention. I contemplated how similarities between coronavirus strains could be exploited to strategically design vaccines, how drugs targeting similar proteins in other viruses could be repurposed, and how unique mutations in this virus\u2019s genome could be used to better understand and curb its high rate of transmission. But as a medical student eager to reenter the world of clinical care, the personal stories from the communities that would be most impacted by this relentless pathogen soon consumed my thoughts. These included communities in Baltimore with which I had worked over the past 7 years and communities in the Virgin Islands where I had spent many summers among my extended family. Their stories emphasized the effects of an increasingly global society on healthcare: Vulnerable populations everywhere are impacted by this virus, and more infectious disease\u2013trained healthcare workers are needed.\nIn Baltimore County, the first case of COVID-19 was reported on 11 March 2020. One day later, K-12 schools across the state were ordered to close. Hearing this news, I immediately thought of the students I had worked with through several mentoring and outreach programs. I had taught them how to subculture bacteria, edited their college admissions essays, attended their prom send-off parties, and even spoken at their funerals. They live with their mothers, fathers, uncles, grandmothers, and any other combination of direct and extended family. Schools had been closed, in part, so that these students would not bring COVID-19 back home, so that they would not have to become caretakers should their caregivers get ill. Many of their family members have diabetes, hypertension and other comorbidities that put them at increased risk of serious complications if infected with COVID-19 [2]. The health of these inner-city communities was already being ravaged by gun violence, police brutality, and institutionalized systems of discrimination that resulted in life expectancies well below the national average [3]. But these students and their families were now facing yet another threat to their health.\nIn the Virgin Islands, about 1600 miles south of Baltimore, the first case of COVID-19 was reported on 13 March 2020. This news shifted my thoughts again, this time toward my sprawling Caribbean family. As I talked to them about the CDC\u2019s new recommendations on social distancing, I remembered the 2 hurricanes that had recently devastated their island, rendering basic necessities scarce, even before COVID-19. I thought about how overwhelming an outbreak there would be for a healthcare system that often struggles to meet the daily needs of its people, a healthcare system that, in typical times, must fly its citizens to hospitals in the United States for anything beyond routine care. I worried about what would happen if my 80-year-old grandfather or my 60-year-old aunt with severe asthma contracted COVID-19. The hospitals where they typically would have been transferred are already operating at close to full capacity. And the number of ventilators, N95 masks, isolation rooms, and healthcare workers on the island is undoubtedly insufficient to respond to even the slightest increase in demand.\nIn settings as varied as inner-city Baltimore and the Virgin Islands, the consequences of a virus that began in Wuhan, China are apparent. Few other events before have so poignantly highlighted the global nature of health, the vulnerability of certain populations around the world, and the need for more infectious disease specialists. The spread of COVID-19 has shown that rapidly mutating microorganisms are unrestrained by borders. This idea is not novel to the infectious disease field, but unfortunately, it has not risen to the forefront of international conversations. In the United States, this is partly due to the shortage of physicians specializing in infectious diseases. In 2020, only 80% of spots in infectious disease fellowships were filled [4], highlighting the need to foster more interest among medical students and residents. During this pandemic, the role of infectious disease specialists as leaders has become evident; they are top-tier advisors to policy makers, public health practitioners disseminating health information to society, researchers identifying treatments and vaccines for the virus, and front-line clinicians treating the most vulnerable patients. But the importance of infectious disease specialists will not end once the number of newly diagnosed COVID-19 cases starts to decrease.\nThis pandemic will cause a shift in medicine such that when clinical training across the world resumes I will join a healthcare workforce that is markedly different from that of my predecessors. At that time, the demand for physicians who specialize in infectious diseases will be amplified. They will be needed in laboratories not only to perfect the treatments for COVID-19, but to initiate research on other pathogens with pandemic potential. They will be needed in hospitals not only to streamline the use of personal protective equipment, but to strengthen our supply channels to prepare for future system surges. They will be needed in government not only to shape and disseminate public health recommendations, but to design policies that preemptively protect those most vulnerable to future pandemics. They will be needed in the clinics not only to treat the complications of COVID-19, but to promote healthy preventive habits. And above all, they will be needed as international ambassadors to strengthen scientific ties between countries in the fight against global health threats.\nThis is a decisive moment for students in healthcare fields around the world. The impact of COVID-19 on the rising generation of doctors, scientists, and public health professionals is undeniable. We are all part of, or connected to, communities impacted by COVID-19 today, but we are also all threatened by the next global pathogen of tomorrow. To protect those communities, we need more infectious disease specialists. I will be one of them. I call on others to join me.\nNotes\nPotential conflicts of interest.

Specimens collected during illness were tested for human coronaviruses (HCoV) types OC43, 229E, HKU1, and NL63.\nResults\nIn total, 993 HCoV infections were identified during the 8 years, with OC43 most commonly seen and 229E the least. HCoVs were detected in a limited time period, between December and April/May and peaked in January/February. Highest infection frequency was in children <5 years (18 per 100 person-years), with little variation in older age groups (range, 7 to 11 per 100 person-years). Overall, 9% of adult cases and 20% of cases in children were associated with medical consultation. Of the 993 infections, 260 were acquired from an infected household contact. The serial interval between index and household-acquired cases ranged from 3.2 to 3.6 days and the secondary infection risk ranged from 7.2% to 12.6% by type.\nConclusions\nCoronaviruses are sharply seasonal. They appear, based on serial interval and secondary infection risk, to have similar transmission potential to influenza A(H3N2) in the same population.\ncoronaviruses, seasonality, epidemiology, transmission, respiratory illness\nTopic: coronavirus adult child michigan respiratory tract infections urticaria infections influenzavirus a influenza a virus, h3n2 subtype\nIssue Section: Major Article\nCoronaviruses, long known to infect a wide variety of species, have been recognized as human respiratory pathogens for more than 60 years [1\u20133]. While animal coronaviruses have been associated with severe disease in their respective hosts, human coronaviruses (HCoV) were historically detected in mild respiratory illnesses [4\u20136]. Therefore, the identification of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) as caused by a coronavirus of animal origin in 2002 was a surprise because of its epidemic behavior as well as its severity [7, 8]. Also a surprise was the ultimate interruption of SARS transmission by public health measures [9]. In 2012, another novel coronavirus of animal origin emerged as the causative agent of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) [10]. Unlike SARS, human-to-human transmission of MERS has been limited and sporadic cases have continued to occur, primarily in Saudi Arabia among those with contact with camels [11]. The current outbreak of a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has focused attention back to this often forgotten and little studied group of pathogens [12].\nHCoVs were first recognized when specimens from individuals ill with respiratory illnesses were inoculated into organ cultures. One of these viruses is now known as OC (organ culture) 43 [13]. Another virus, 229E was first grown in primary human kidney culture [14]. Because of the difficulties in isolating them, much of the initial work in understanding their occurrence in was done by serology [15, 16]. Following renewed interest after the SARS epidemic, 2 additional coronaviruses, HKU1 and NL63, were identified in the 2000s, initially from persons with severe respiratory illnesses [17\u201320].\nAvailability of reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) has now made it possible to detect infection easily for each of the 4 known human coronaviruses. However, as data from population-based studies using molecular methods have accumulated, minimal attention has been paid to these viruses, perhaps because there was so little known about their role in respiratory illnesses. The Household Influenza Vaccine Evaluation (HIVE) study is a longitudinal investigation of respiratory illnesses in households with children in the Ann Arbor, Michigan area that has been ongoing since 2010. Here we report on the occurrence of the 4 HCoV types over an 8-year period.\nMETHODS\nStudy Population\nThe complete methods of the HIVE cohort have been published previously [21]. Households were recruited from local households receiving primary care from the University of Michigan Health Care System. From 2010\u20132011 through 2015\u20132016, eligible households were those with 4 or more members at least 2 of whom were younger than 18 years. In subsequent years, eligible households contained 3 or more members including at least 1 child younger than 5 years (2016\u20132017) or younger than 10 years (2017\u20132018). Each year in the spring or summer, households attended an enrollment or reengagement visit to collect or update the demographic characteristics for each participant and household. Adult household members provided informed consent for themselves and their children, and children 7 years or older also provided verbal assent prior to participating. This study was reviewed and approved by the institutional review board at the University of Michigan Medical School.\nAcute Respiratory Illness Surveillance\nHIVE participants were instructed to report the onset of 2 or more acute respiratory illness (ARI) symptoms in anyone in the household, including: cough, fever or feverishness, nasal congestion, chills, headache, body aches, and sore throat. Weekly email and phone contacts were used to confirm the presence or absence of ARI in the household. Beginning in 2014\u20132015, a separate set of age-specific symptom qualifiers were provided for participants younger than 3 years, including: cough, fever or feverishness, nasal congestion, trouble breathing, fussiness, decreased appetite, and fatigue. Ill participants with 2 or more of the above symptoms attended an illness visit within 7 days of illness onset where study staff interviewed them about their illness and collected nasal and throat swabs (nasal only in children <3 years) combined in a single vial of viral transport media. Study staff followed-up with ill participants approximately a week after their illness visit to collect additional information about the course of the illness, including participants\u2019 reports of whether they contacted a health care provider regarding their illness.\nPrior to the 2014\u20132015 season, HIVE ARI surveillance periods were seasonal based on the likely influenza season. For the first 4 study years, the annual surveillance periods were 1 October 2010 through 30 April 2011, 1 December 2011 through 10 May 2012, 1 October 2012 through 13 May 2013, and 1 October 2013 through 30 April 2014. Surveillance resumed on 1 October 2014 and has been operating year round since then. New surveillance years are designated beginning 1 July and lasting until 30 June of the subsequent year.\nLaboratory Testing\nRespiratory specimens collected at illness visits were tested for detection of respiratory viruses, including the 4 seasonal coronavirus types (229E, OC43, HKU1, and NL63). For specimens collected prior to the 2016\u20132017 study year, testing was performed by singleplex RT-PCR using primers and probes developed by the CDC Division of Viral Diseases, Gastroenteritis, and Respiratory Viruses [22]. Specimens collected in the 2016\u20132017 and 2017\u20132018 years were tested using the FTD Respiratory Pathogen 33 multiplex PCR kit (Fast Track Diagnostics).\nStatistical Analysis\nSeasonal case counts of HCoV 229E, HKU1, NL63, and OC43 were used to assess annual patterning of each type; counts were also summed by month across all seasons combined to assess broad seasonality by type. Illnesses with multiple, coincident HCoV detections were only counted once in analyses of overall HCoV infections, but each HCoV type involved in coincident detection was also included in type-specific analyses.\nType-specific coronavirus incidence and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated by age group (<5, 6\u201311, 12\u201317, 18\u201349, and \u226550 years) and by study year. Incidence was calculated as the number of type-specific coronavirus infections divided by the total participant time included during a specified time period. Because the majority of the HCoV season was captured even in study years without year-round surveillance, all participants were treated as contributing a full year of person time for each study year in which they were enrolled.\nFor each study year, we defined household index cases as the first person in a household to develop ARI with HCoV detection. Secondary cases were defined as those who developed ARI with HCoV detection within 14 days following illness in a household contact with the same type. The serial interval was calculated as the average number of days from the illness onset in a household index case to the illness onset in secondary cases. Secondary infection risks were calculated as the proportion of household contacts exposed to an index case who developed secondary infection. For the purpose of these transmission analyses, only the first introduction of HCoV to a household was considered.\nWe used latent class analysis to identify and compare classes of illness severity of HCoV infection across age groups and the 4 HCoV types (Supplementary Materials). For the latent items, we identified 7 participant-reported potential markers of illness severity including illness symptoms (cough, fever, fatigue, wheezing, and dyspnea), missed work or school, and medically attended illness (phone consultation, outpatient care, and inpatient care). A priori, we anticipated 3 latent classes of severity to represent mild, moderate, and severe illness; model diagnostics also confirmed that a 3-class model was most parsimonious. Latent class groups were then assigned to each HCoV infection, not including cases with multiple coincident HCoV types detected. Age-adjusted multinomial logistic regression models were then used to compare the odds of being assigned to each latent class between the 4 HCoV types.\nRESULTS\nCharacteristics of the Study Population\nThe number of individuals under study ranged from 895 to 1441, and the number of households ranged from 209 to 340 over the 8 years (Table 1). Because of the requirement that children be present in the household, the studied population tended to be young, with relative absence of older adults. The numbers in the cohort varied from year to year but the age structure remained similar in all years, due to combined retention of existing households and recruitment of new households with young children.\nTable 1.\nCharacteristics of the Study Population and Counts of Human Coronavirus Infections by Study Year: Household Influenza Vaccine Evaluation (HIVE) Cohort 2010\u20132018\nSeason\nCharacteristic 2010\u20132011 2011\u20132012 2012\u20132013 2013\u20132014 2014\u20132015 2015\u20132016 2016\u20132017 2017\u20132018\nSurveillance period  1 Oct\u201330 Apr   1 Dec\u201310 May  1 Oct\u201313 May  1 Oct\u201330 Apr  1 Oct\u201330 Jun  1 Jul\u201330 Jun  1 Jul\u201330 Jun  1 Jul\u201330 Jun \nHouseholds enrolled, No.  328  213  321  232  340  227  209  293 \nParticipants enrolled, No.  1441  943  1426  1049  1431  996  895  1189 \nAge groups, y, No. (%)                 \n0\u20135  250 (17.4)  131 (13.9)  225 (15.8)  133 (12.7)  205 (14.3)  97 (9.7)  117 (13.1)  220 (18.5) \n6\u201311  382 (26.5)  278 (29.5)  401 (28.1)  316 (30.1)  445 (31.1)  327 (32.8)  257 (28.7)  298 (25.1) \n12\u201317  208 (14.4)  141 (15.0)  208 (14.6)  169 (16.1)  212 (14.8)  173 (17.4)  150 (16.8)  166 (14.0) \n18\u201349  546 (37.9)  353 (37.4)  536 (37.6)  385 (36.7)  512 (35.8)  351 (35.2)  332 (37.1)  457 (38.4) \n\u226550  55 (3.8)  40 (4.2)  56 (3.9)  46 (4.4)  57 (4.0)  48 (4.8)  39 (4.4)  48 (4.0) \nARI reports, No.  1028  417  1227  706  1362  934  847  1401 \nHCoV-positive cases, No. (% of all ARI cases)                 \nAll typesa  152 (14.8)  59 (14.1)  200 (16.3)  105 (14.9)  113 (8.3)  109 (11.7)  112 (13.2)  143 (10.2) \n229E  7 (0.7)  20 (4.8)  8 (0.7)  45 (6.4)  8 (0.6)  3 (0.3)  46 (5.4)  12 (0.9) \nHKU1  28 (2.7)  19 (4.6)  17 (1.4)  30 (4.2)  14 (1)  36 (3.9)  0 (0)  49 (3.5) \nNL63  62 (6)  14 (3.4)  75 (6.1)  21 (3)  37 (2.7)  40 (4.3)  11 (1.3)  63 (4.5) \nOC43  56 (5.4)  13 (3.1)  113 (9.2)  16 (2.3)  71 (5.2)  34 (3.6)  58 (6.8)  26 (1.9) \nAbbreviations: ARI, acute respiratory infections; HCoV, human coronavirus.\naIndividual types sum to more than all types because coinfections were counted in each type, but only included as single cases in counts of all types.\nOpen in new tab\nThe number of ARIs reported also varied from year to year, mainly related to the number of individuals on report but also the differential occurrence of influenza and other respiratory viruses (Table 1). Overall, from 2010\u20132011 through 2017\u20132018, 7992 ARI cases were reported to HIVE; 7469 (93%) had an illness visit with specimen collection and were tested for respiratory virus detection. The proportion of ARIs associated with coronavirus identification varied between 8.3% during the major influenza year 2014\u20132015 to 16.3% in 2012\u20132013. Codetection of multiple coronavirus types ranged from 0.7% of all coronavirus ARIs in 2010\u20132011 to 14.2% in 2014\u20132015.\nVariation in Identifying the 4 Coronaviruses by Seasons and Years\nThere was distinct seasonality in the identifications of the viruses. In the first 5 of the 8 years, no surveillance was conducted from June to September. When year-round surveillance was in place in the 2015\u20132016 through 2017\u20132018 study years, only 9 (2.5%) of the total 364 coronavirus-associated ARI occurred from June through September. Combined over the 8 years, the number of identifications for each virus increased in December, peaked in January or February, and began to decrease in March (Figure 1). The seasonal similarity between the 4 types is striking, with only the peak aggregate month differing between January and February.\nFigure 1.\nOpen in new tabDownload slide\nCounts of human coronavirus (HCoV) infections over 8 study years by type and month of illness onset: Household Influenza Vaccine Evaluation Study 2010\u20132018.\nIdentification of each of the 4 coronaviruses types occurred in each of the 8 study years, except for 2016\u20132017 when no HKU1 viruses were identified (Table 1 and Figure 2). In prior community studies [16, 23\u201325], there were suggestions of a cycling between 229E and OC43, with major years followed by lesser years. Such a pattern appears to be present for all types where relatively high incidence is not seen in consecutive years for a specific type. Likewise, combinations of cocirculating types were not found to be consistent from year to year.\nFigure 2.\nOpen in new tabDownload slide\nIncidence per 100 person-years of human coronavirus (HCoV) infections by type over 8 study years: Household Influenza Vaccine Evaluation Study 2010\u20132018. Error bars represent 95% confidence intervals.\nOccurrence of Infections by Age\nInfection rates for common respiratory pathogens are highest in young children and usually fall off with increasing age. With the exception of 229E, where incidence per 100 person-years was relatively low and did not vary by age, the incidence was consistently highest among children younger than 5 years (Figure 3). Among those older than 5 years, incidence was relatively flat with little consistent variation with increase in age.\nFigure 3.\nOpen in new tabDownload slide\nIncidence per 100 person-years of human coronavirus (HCoV) infections by type and age group over 8 study years: Household Influenza Vaccine Evaluation Study 2010\u20132018. Error bars represent 95% confidence intervals.\nIllness Severity and Outcomes\nOverall, 9% of adult cases and 20% of cases in children were associated with medical consultation. However, medical consultation only captures 1 facet of overall illness severity. Therefore, we used latent class analysis to categorize coronavirus case severity based on participant-reported symptoms and actions taken during the course of their illness (Supplementary Materials). Mild illnesses were primarily characterized by cough and fatigue, those with moderate illnesses were additionally likely to have fever and to miss school or work, and those with severe illness additionally were likely to have wheezing, dyspnea, or to seek care for their illness. Of all single coronavirus detections, 59% were categorized as mild illness by latent class methods. Moderate and severe illness were noted in 31% and 10% of coronavirus detections, respectively. HCoV illnesses in children younger than 5 years and adults older than 50 years were most likely to be classified as severe. In age-adjusted multinomial regression models (Table 2), 229E was associated with significantly higher odds of severe illness (versus mild) compared to the 3 other HCoV types (odds ratio [OR], 1.82; 95% CI, 1.01\u20133.27). On the other hand, NL63 was associated with significantly lower odds of severe illness (versus mild) compared to the other 3 types (OR, 0.59; 95% CI, .35\u2013.99).\nTable 2.\nOdd Ratios and 95% Confidence Intervals From Multinomial Logistic Regression Models Predicting Illness Severity From Human Coronavirus (HCoV) Type and Age Group\nSeverity Group, Odds Ratio (95% Confidence Interval)a\nMild Moderate Severe\nHCoV type       \n229E  Ref  1.51 (1.00\u20132.29)  1.82 (1.01\u20133.27) \nHKU1  Ref  1.13 (.77\u20131.66)  1.51 (.88\u20132.59) \nNL63  Ref  0.88 (.65\u20131.20)  0.59 (.35\u2013.99) \nOC43  Ref  0.84 (.62\u20131.13)  0.87 (.55\u20131.37) \nAge group, y       \n0\u20135   Ref  1.46 (1.04\u20132.04)  2.06 (1.27\u20133.33) \n6\u201311   Ref  1.53 (1.11\u20132.11)  1.02 (.60\u20131.72) \n12\u201317   Ref  0.99 (.62\u20131.61)  0.71 (.31\u20131.62) \n18\u201349   Ref  0.55 (.40\u2013.74)  0.59 (.37\u2013.94) \n\u226550   Ref  0.63 (.24\u20131.61)  1.23 (.40\u20133.80) \naOdds ratios are relative to all other groups within category (ie, 229E vs not, 0\u20135 y vs not).\nOpen in new tab\nHousehold Transmission\nHouseholds present an ideal setting for determining the transmission characteristics of respiratory viruses. Of the 993 HCoVs identified, 260 occurred within 14 days of exposure to a household contact infected with the same type. The secondary attack risk was 7.2% for 229E, 8.6% for HKU1, 10.6% for OC43, and 12.6% for NL63. The average serial interval between the onset of illness in the household index case and onset of illness in secondary cases was similar across HCoV types (3.2 days for NL63 and HKU1, 3.3 days for OC43, and 3.6 days for 229E). Consistent with overall patterns of incidence by age (Figure 3), index cases were most frequently children, with the exception of 229E where adults aged 18 to 49 years were responsible for nearly half of the household introductions (Table 3).\nTable 3.\nHousehold Index Casesa by Human Coronavirus (HCoV) Type and Age Group\nHCoV Type, No. (Column %)\n229E HKU1 NL63 OC43\nAge group, y         \n0\u20135  13 (11.5)  38 (26.8)  45 (20.7)  82 (31.2) \n6\u201311  21 (18.6)  35 (25.4)  78 (36.9)  65 (24.7) \n12\u201317  16 (14.2)  9 (6.3)  24 (11.1)  24 (9.1) \n18\u201349  54 (47.8)  56 (39.4)  64 (29.5)  83 (31.6) \n\u226550  9 (8.0)  3 (2.1)  6 (2.8)  9 (3.4) \naOnly index cases from the first introduction of each coronavirus type to a household per season are included.\nOpen in new tab\nDiscussion\nWhile HCoVs have been recognized for many years to be a cause of common respiratory illnesses, documentation of their involvement has lagged behind that of other agents, such as the rhinoviruses; this includes frequency of infection, illnesses produced, and transmission characteristics. We might not even know about the existence of the 2 most recently identified viruses, NL63 and HKU1, if attention had not been directed to HCoV following the occurrence of SARS. The development of the RT-PCR test and the inclusion of the 4 types of HCoV in multiplex clinical testing panels, mainly used in severe illnesses such as pneumonia, have resulted in numerous reports of the involvement of these viruses in hospitalizations. While studies of hospitalized patients have established the role of HCoV in causing lower respiratory illness and the global circulation of these viruses, they are unable to shed light on the frequency or seasonality of these viruses in the broader community. There are a few exceptions that have followed HCoV infections over longer periods, often in special population groups. In particular, a recent study covered 9 years of Norwegian children hospitalized with respiratory infection and found that coronaviruses were involved in 9.1% of episodes [26]. The highest frequencies were in young children, similar to the infection rates demonstrated in the current study; also identical to the current study was the frequency of types involved, with OC43 the most common and 229E the least. While the authors did not emphasize seasonality, it was clear that most of the infections occurred in the winter months.\nThe regular appearance of all types of coronaviruses in the same months with minimal circulation in the summer was a clear finding of this study. Unlike the influenza viruses, which peak at different times during the colder season from year to year, and even the rhinoviruses, which are most common in the autumn and spring but are present year round, the coronaviruses are sharply seasonal with little spread after May until November or December. Our findings, on a larger scale, expand on the results of a 2-year study in childcare attendees suggesting a similar seasonal pattern [27]. It is of interest that the SARS coronavirus outbreaks occurred during the same time period, with the end of global outbreaks in the period of May\u2013June 2003 [28]. Whether such a timetable applies to the current circulation of SARS-CoV-2 is impossible to determine at this time.\nAnother notable finding in this community study was the fact that, in those older than 4 years, HCoV infection rates were relatively consistent. Most agents causing lower respiratory infections typically have falling incidence with increasing age, sometimes with an increase in young adults [29]. However, it is clear that like other respiratory viruses, HCoV infects people of all ages and infection only produces relative immunity. The type-specificity of the protection is also not completely clear, although frequent cocirculation of types and codetection within individuals suggests that protection is likely not highly cross-reactive. As with SARS and MERS, SARS-CoV-2 has most frequently infected adults to date [30]. Whether the relative sparing of children has largely been driven by contact and exposure patterns or other factors remains unclear. However, the frequency of infection in adults suggests that there is likely little cross-protective immunity from prior seasonal HCoV infection.\nThe MERS coronavirus is limited in its potential for human to human transmission except in the nosocomial setting [11]. Although the SARS coronavirus more effectively transmitted human to human, transmission was interrupted by public health interventions [31]. The seasonal HCoV viruses are clearly different in their transmission characteristics given their continued seasonal circulation year after year. The serial interval between cases and the secondary infection risk in the HIVE cohort was similar to that previously found for A(H3N2) [32]. The secondary attack rates in the current study may reflect the relatively small household structure found in our region. A longitudinal study in Kenya found overall attack rates as high as 34.0% over 1 season in a study of households of sizes ranging up to 37 members [33].\nThe transition from pandemic to seasonal circulation is well established for influenza, wherein, following an influenza pandemic, the novel virus becomes the new seasonal virus, replacing the previous A subtype [34]. The 4 current HCoVs have been circulating for decades, and it is unclear how they initially emerged or whether they replaced previously circulating viruses [35]. Contrary to influenza, MERS and SARS have not become a fixed presence in seasonal respiratory illness circulation on a global scale. Only time will tell if SARS-CoV-2 will become a continuing presence in the seasonal HCoV landscape, continue with limited circulation as with MERS, or, like SARS, disappear from humans altogether.\nSupplementary Data\nSupplementary materials are available at The Journal of Infectious Diseases online.

By replacing conventional phase 3 testing of vaccine candidates, such trials may subtract many months from the licensure process, making efficacious vaccines available more quickly. Obviously, challenging volunteers with this live virus risks inducing severe disease and possibly even death. However, we argue that such studies, by accelerating vaccine evaluation, could reduce the global burden of coronavirus-related mortality and morbidity. Volunteers in such studies could autonomously authorize the risks to themselves, and their net risk could be acceptable if participants comprise healthy young adults, who are at relatively low risk of serious disease following natural infection, if they have a high baseline risk of natural infection, and if during the trial they receive frequent monitoring and, following any infection, the best available care.\ncoronavirus, vaccines, human challenge studies, randomized controlled trials, risk-taking, ethics\nTopic: coronavirus licensure vaccines infections morbidity mortality coronavirus vaccines\nIssue Section: Major Article\nAlleviation of the enormous burden of mortality and morbidity associated with the COVID-19 pandemic will probably depend on the development of effective vaccines that could be rolled out widely. Many candidate vaccines are in development [1], but recent estimates cite at least 1\u20131.5 years to vaccine rollout [2]. A significant proportion of that time is due to the requirement to assess efficacy and safety in placebo-controlled phase 3 trials, which typically involve several thousand participants followed for long enough in the field to assess differences in disease incidence between vaccine and control groups, with many participants taking precautions to avoid exposure. We suggest that, in the circumstances of a devastating global pandemic, controlled human challenge studies (following the normal initial safety, vaccine dose finding, and immunogenicity studies\u2014phases 1/2 in Figure 1) may be an acceptable way to bypass phase 3 testing, and speed the licensure of efficacious vaccines.\nFigure 1.\nOpen in new tabDownload slide\nThe process to vaccine licensure through a controlled human challenge trial and large study to assess short-term safety (black) compared to the conventional phase 3 trial route to licensure (grey). Submission for licensure could occur substantially earlier with a controlled human challenge trial.\nTHE PROPOSED STUDY DESIGN\nVolunteers for human challenge studies would be drawn from previously uninfected individuals at relatively low risk of complications or mortality from SARS-CoV-2 infection (eg, young adults, without chronic health conditions, and not otherwise sick) [3\u20137] and who are at substantial risk of natural exposure to SARS-CoV-2 (eg, resident in areas with high transmission rates). Such a target group might comprise uninfected persons aged 20\u201345 years, an age range in which the risk of death or serious complications following infection is substantially lower than in older age groups [4, 5].\nThe controlled challenge model would need to be standardized before using it to test vaccines. Volunteers, previously uninfected, would be required for an initial dose-escalation study of the viral challenge to select a dose of virus exposure such that most placebo recipients become infected (for statistical reasons), and have a clinical response that is not more severe than the one associated with natural infection (for ethical reasons). The latter would require comparison with a cohort of individuals of similar age who had been infected naturally. For this standardization, volunteers may spend 2 weeks in a clinical isolation facility prior to the challenge, with viral and serologic testing, to exclude those with previous or recent infection (or a shorter duration if suitable serological tests for recent infections are developed). Overall, these preparatory studies (upper-left black square in Figure 1) may take several weeks and could start before vaccine candidates are available for evaluation.\nMultiple measures would be put in place to ensure that, prior to consenting, potential participants fully comprehend the unusual risks involved in the study.\nAfter the controlled human challenge model had been set up, vaccines could be evaluated. Volunteers who had not been previously infected would be randomized to receive either the candidate vaccine(s) under investigation or placebo. After an interval to permit a full immune response to the vaccine, a controlled exposure to SARS-CoV-2 would be administered. Appropriate vaccine schedules (eg, dose, number of doses) will have been determined, to the extent possible, in the conventional phase 1/2 immunogenicity and safety studies that preceded the challenge study.\nFollowing the challenge, the participants would be carefully followed, to monitor whether those vaccinated had a different response to viral challenge. Because the challenge studies would be relatively small and some volunteers might show few clinical symptoms, there would need to be careful consideration of the choice of the primary endpoint, through discussions with regulatory authorities. Possibilities would include viral load, measured at least daily (eg, in throat swabs), and then cumulated over the course of the infection (as has been done in influenza challenge studies) [8], and time to first clinical symptoms. For some vaccines, the endpoint might be the proportion infected. Throughout the study, intense immunological monitoring would seek any correlates of vaccine effect. The required size of such studies would depend upon the endpoints chosen, but they might require of the order of 100 volunteers.\nAny volunteers in whom infection was confirmed would receive excellent care for COVID-19, including priority for any scarce life-saving resources, in state-of-the-art facilities. Throughout the trial and until infectiousness was ruled out, all participants would remain isolated in a secure and comfortable setting (eg, in settings converted from those used for influenza challenge studies).\nIf this human challenge study showed a vaccine candidate to be efficacious, an expanded placebo-controlled study would be conducted in the field, involving at least 3000 vaccinated persons, primarily for short-term safety assessment, but also to gather further evidence on immunogenicity (Figure 1, right-most black box). Participants would be carefully monitored for adverse effects following vaccination, to gather safety data sufficient for submission for licensure. This study (not involving a challenge) should be conducted on the eventual primary initial target group for an effective vaccine\u2014including the elderly and those with concomitant illnesses that increase the risk of serious disease following infection. With prior planning, this large-scale assessment of safety could be completed in several months, as initially only short-term adverse effects would be assessed.\nTogether, the information from the challenge study and the short-term follow-up of those in the expanded (phase 2) field study may produce evidence sufficient to justify accelerated licensure.\nParticipants of the expanded field study could continue to be followed longer term in parallel with the submission for licensure, so that suitable actions could be taken if any long-term adverse effects, including disease enhancement, were identified. As with standard vaccine licensure, additional, postapproval studies would be required to assess safety and effectiveness in routine use. Any necessary studies of dosage and safety in special groups (eg, children, pregnant women, and immunocompromised persons) could be conducted, before extending vaccination to these groups, as judged appropriate.\nIt is possible that the protection that was apparent in a challenge study will not be replicated when the vaccine is used to protect against natural infection. This would have to be carefully monitored in the early stages of vaccine rollout, for example through case-control studies. In such an event, appropriate modification will be made to the vaccination program (including potentially stopping vaccination).\nA particular concern with respect to some vaccine constructs against coronavirus is that they may induce more severe disease following infection, as has been reported in animal models of both SARS and MERS vaccine candidates [9]. If any vaccine candidate shows evidence of such effects in animal models, it is likely to be ruled out for human testing. However, for those candidates that are taken forward for human testing, the possibility of enhancement should be borne in mind and the challenge studies should be designed in such a way that small groups of volunteers are challenged sequentially. In this way, studies could be stopped at an early stage, upon first strong indication of vaccine-induced enhanced disease. If the vaccine candidate did enhance disease, the controlled human challenge model would provide much more rapid evidence to support stopping the testing of a harmful vaccine candidate, with far fewer vaccinated persons, than a traditional phase 3 efficacy study.\nACCELERATION OF LICENSURE AND SUBSTANTIAL SOCIAL VALUE\nThe proposed trial method would potentially cut the wait time for the rollout of an efficacious vaccine. Challenge studies (which always directly expose all participants to a pathogen to assess efficacy) generally require fewer participants, followed over a shorter period than do standard efficacy studies (in which many participants are never exposed). Rollout of an efficacious vaccine to age groups not included in the challenge studies may depend on immunological bridging, but this would be a component of the expanded safety studies discussed above. It is possible that this process could take several months shorter than reliance on standard phase 3 testing to assess efficacy. While rollout to other populations might require initial bridging studies, these could be conducted relatively quickly.\nIt seems clear that, in the absence of an efficacious vaccine, the global death toll from COVID-19 will be enormous. A recent modelling study suggests that, even with mitigation strategies focusing on shielding the elderly and slowing but not interrupting transmission, there may be 20 million this year [10]. If the use of human challenge helped to make the vaccine available before the epidemic has completely passed, the savings in human lives could be in the thousands or conceivably millions. Intense social distancing and related control measures, held in place for many months between now and the availability of vaccine, will themselves take a toll on economies, societies, and population health. Advancing the registration and rollout of an efficacious vaccine, even by a few months, could save many thousands of lives, and commands enormous societal value.\nAUTONOMOUS AUTHORIZATION\nDeliberate exposure of study participants to SARS-CoV-2 gives rise to understandable ethical worries. It may seem impermissible to ask people to take on risk of severe illness or death, even for an important collective gain. But we actually ask people to take such risks for others\u2019 direct gain every time we ask volunteer firefighters to rush into burning buildings, relatives to donate a live organ to loved ones, healthy volunteers to participate in drug and vaccine toxicity trials with no prospect of improving their health (and some risk of undermining it) [11], relatively healthy volunteers to participate in studies involving long antiretroviral drug interruptions that risk their health with negligible prospect of improving it [12], and other challenge studies in which healthy volunteers expose themselves to pathogens [13]. This spring, we are clearly within our right when we invite citizens to volunteer for Emergency Medical Services (EMS) to fight a pandemic that augments both the personal risks for EMS workers and the social value of their work, and initial trials for the Moderna SARS-CoV-2 vaccine are being accelerated by skipping prior animal testing and the margin of safety that it would have added [14].\nOne major reason why it is permissible to risk medical harm to volunteers in medical studies, even when their personal health care does not require that risk, is that these volunteers will have autonomously consented to take on these risks. Adult persons can legitimize many interventions in their bodies and health that are normally prohibited, simply by saying \u201cYes,\u201d with full understanding and voluntariness. In the present case, the study would involve multiple tests of comprehension of all risks (and the risk factors for serious outcomes among individuals in otherwise low-risk age groups may be somewhat clearer by the time recruitment takes place), so that the decision is deeply informed and voluntary. The exclusive recruitment of participants aged 20\u201345 years, although children are less likely to have severe symptoms upon COVID-19 infection [6, 7], seeks to safeguard the quality of participants\u2019 consent. The wide news coverage and widespread fear of Covid-19 should keep it clear that exposure to this virus is no small matter. While in other studies mentioned above, nonconsenting sex partners and fetuses of study participants may get infected [15, 16], the proposed controlled challenge study would avoid risk to nonparticipants by isolating participants whilst infectious.\nADDED RISK REMAINS ACCEPTABLE\nBut a remaining key question, for deeming human challenge studies ethical, pertains to risk. Are the risks to participants, even when they are justified by the social importance of the trial and backed by participants\u2019 willful permission, also being kept to the necessary minimum? And do the risks fall below a postulated cap on the acceptable risk of medical trials, even ones of the highest social value and with participants\u2019 consent [15]?\nThe proposed challenge studies seek to contain the risk to participants in 6 different ways. First, the study will recruit only healthy patients from age groups in which the risk of severe disease and death following SARS-CoV-2 infection is low. Second, there is the possibility that the vaccine candidate will protect at least some of those who are vaccinated. Third, in the absence of an effective vaccine, a high proportion of the general population is likely to be naturally infected with SARS-CoV-2 at some point [17], including those who might participate in a challenge study; by volunteering to be artificially infected they may be just hastening an event that is likely to occur in later months anyhow. Fourth, only people with an especially high baseline risk of getting exposed during or soon after the trial period should be recruited (eg, people residing in areas with high transmission rates). Fifth, participants would be monitored carefully and frequently following the challenge and afforded the best available care if needed (eg, guaranteed access to state-of-the-art facilities of the health system, notwithstanding the possibility of severe shortages of medical care during the evolving pandemic). Sixth, by the time vaccine candidates are being tested, some therapeutics may be approved, which may reduce participants\u2019 risk of morbidity and mortality further. For these 6 reasons, mortality and morbidity from participation notwithstanding, net mortality and morbidity from participation should remain low or negative.\nCONCLUSION\nA novel strain of coronavirus forces us to consider unconventional approaches. We believe that controlled SARS-CoV-2 vaccine challenge studies may accelerate the time it takes to evaluate and license vaccines and hence could make vaccines available sooner for widespread rollout. Such an approach is not without risks, but every week that vaccine rollout is delayed will be accompanied by many thousands of deaths globally. Importantly, challenge studies are conducted against the background of competent volunteers\u2019 informed consent, minimization of study risks, and high baseline risks of infection for participants. They do not violate participants\u2019 individual rights on the altar of emergency response, but heed both individual rights and the global public health emergency.\nAs far as we are aware, the current plan for evaluating the efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines is through slower phase 3 trials. It will take some time to develop and operationalize challenge studies and we are not suggesting that ongoing development of any vaccines which become ready for phase 3 trials must be paused during this period. However, we believe that challenge studies could be set up before the time that most vaccines would be ready for efficacy testing.\nIn addition to their use for assessing the efficacy of vaccines, human challenge studies may also help evaluate drugs that might be given either as preexposure prophylaxis to prevent infection in individuals at high risk of infection, or as postexposure prophylaxis, given shortly after a potential exposure, either to abort infection or to prevent the occurrence of disease. Challenge studies may also be a way of advancing understanding of the pathogenesis of the progression from infection to disease.\nTo further assess the potential of human challenge studies to speed vaccine development, we suggest that an expert group might be convened, including those with experience of human challenge studies of other pathogens, regulators, vaccine trialists, ethicists, potential participants, and relevant funding agencies, to plan if and how such studies might be taken forward ethically and expeditiously.\nNotes\nDisclaimer.

We aimed to clarify the characteristics and clinical significance of peripheral lymphocyte subset alteration in COVID-19.\nMethods\nThe levels of peripheral lymphocyte subsets were measured by flow cytometry in 60 hospitalized COVID-19 patients before and after treatment, and their association with clinical characteristics and treatment efficacy was analyzed.\nResults\nTotal lymphocytes, CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, B cells, and natural killer (NK) cells decreased in COVID-19 patients, and severe cases had a lower level than mild cases. The subsets showed a significant association with inflammatory status in COVID-19, especially CD8+ T cells and CD4+/CD8+ ratio. After treatment, 37 patients (67%) showed clinical response, with an increase in CD8+ T cells and B cells. No significant change in any subset was detected in nonresponsive cases. In multivariate analysis, posttreatment decrease in CD8+ T cells and B cells and increase in CD4+/CD8+ ratio were indicated as independent predictors of poor efficacy.\nConclusions\nPeripheral lymphocyte subset alteration was associated with clinical characteristics and treatment efficacy of COVID-19.

The novel virus was officially named SARS-CoV-2, with the disease termed COVID-19 [4].\nLymphocytes and the subsets of CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, B cells, and natural killer (NK) cells play an important role in the maintenance of immune system function. After virus infection, alteration in total lymphocyte numbers and the subsets varies with different virus types, indicating a potential association between lymphocyte subset alteration and viral pathogenic mechanisms [5]. Recent studies indicated a clear decrease in peripheral lymphocytes in COVID-19 patients but any alteration in the subsets was still unknown [6, 7]. In this study, we aimed to clarify the characteristics and clinical significance of peripheral lymphocyte subset alteration in COVID-19, which might help elucidate the pathogenesis and develop novel biomarkers and therapeutic strategies for COVID-19.\nMETHODS\nStudy Population\nWe enrolled 60 patients with COVID-19, which was confirmed by detecting SARS-CoV-2 RNA in throat swab samples using a SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid detection kit according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol (Shanghai BioGerm Medical Biotechnology). All the patients were initially admitted to Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University from 7 January to 14 February 2020. In addition, we had previously tested 245 healthy blood donors to establish interlaboratory reference ranges for various parameters. These reference values were used to provide data for the healthy controls in this study.\nThe study was approved by the ethics committee of Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University (No. 2020011). Written informed consent was obtained from patients.\nData Collection\nThe following information on each patient was extracted from electronic medical records: age, sex, medical history, symptoms, severity assessment on admission, laboratory findings, chest computed tomography (CT) or radiograph findings, treatment, and efficacy. On admission, severe illness was defined according to the following criteria: (1) breathing rate \u226530 times/min; (2) pulse oximeter oxygen saturation (SpO2) \u226493% at rest; and (3) ratio of partial pressure of arterial oxygen (PaO2) to fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) \u2264300 mmHg. After 1 week of treatment, clinical response was defined according to the following criteria: (1) symptom alleviation (eg, fever, cough, chest distress, and shortness of breath); and (2) improvement in radiological abnormalities on chest CT or radiograph. Cases not meeting these criteria were classified as nonresponsive.\nFlow Cytometry\nSamples of EDTA anticoagulated peripheral blood (2 mL) were collected from patients with COVID-19 before initial treatment and a second sample was collected after 1 week of treatment. All samples were tested within 6 hours of being obtained. Briefly, CD3+/CD4+/CD8+ T-cell, CD19+ B-cell, and CD16+CD56+ NK-cell counts (cells/\u03bcL) were measured by multiple-color flow cytometry with human monoclonal anti-CD3-fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC), anti-CD4-phycoerythrin (PE), anti-CD8-allophycocyanin (APC), anti-CD19-PE, anti-CD16-APC, and anti-CD56-PE antibodies (BD Multitest) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. The cells were analyzed on a BD FACS Canto II flow cytometry system (BD Biosciences).\nStatistical Analysis\nCategorical data were described as percentages and continuous data as median with interquartile range (IQR). A nonparametric comparative test for continuous data was used to compare variables between groups. Multivariate analysis was used to identify independent predictors of lymphocyte subsets for the treatment efficacy in COVID-19. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was conducted to evaluate the ability of lymphocyte subsets in predicting treatment efficacy. Bootstrap test was used to compare 2 correlated ROC curves. All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS Statistics version 21.0 software. P < .05 was considered statistically significant.\nRESULTS\nBaseline Characteristics of 60 COVID-19 Patients\nSixty COVID-19 patients were included in the study (Table 1). The median age was 60 years (IQR, 38\u201366), and 22 patients (37%) were male. Hypertension (15%) and diabetes (10%) were the most common comorbidities. Fever (70%), cough (48%), and shortness of breath (32%) were the most common symptoms. According to CT or radiograph findings, 40 patients (67%) showed bilateral pneumonia. In blood tests, leukocytes, neutrophils, and platelets were below the normal range in 17 (32%), 11 (21%), and 11 (21%) patients, and above the normal range in 6 (11%), 7 (13%), and 1 (2%) patients, respectively. Lymphocytes were below the normal range in 38 patients (72%).\nTable 1.\nClinical Characteristics of 60 Patients With COVID-19 Pneumonia\nCharacteristic Patients Normal Range\nAge, y, median (IQR)  60 (38\u201366)  \u2026 \nMale, No. (%)  22 (37)  \u2026 \nComorbidities, No. (%)     \nHypertension  9 (15)  \u2026 \nDiabetes  6 (10)  \u2026 \nHeart diseases  1 (2)  \u2026 \nSymptoms, No. (%)     \nFever  42 (70)  \u2026 \nCough  29 (48)  \u2026 \nBreath shortness  19 (32)  \u2026 \nMyalgia  8 (13)  \u2026 \nBilateral lung distribution, No. (%)  40 (67)  \u2026 \nSevere illness on admission, No. (%)  19 (32)  \u2026 \nBlood count, \u00d7109/L, median (IQR)     \nLeukocyte  4.2 (3.3\u20135.9)  3.5\u20139.5 \nNeutrophil  2.8 (2.2\u20134.5)  1.8\u20136.3 \nLymphocyte  0.8 (0.6\u20131.2)  1.1\u20133.2 \nPlatelet  186 (131\u2013225)  125\u2013350 \nInflammatory indicators, median (IQR)     \nESR, mm/h   24 (11\u201341)  0\u201315 \nC-reactive protein, mg/L   26 (9\u201367)  0\u201310 \nInterleukin-6, pg/mL  13 (6\u201329)  0\u20137 \nTreatment, No. (%)     \nOxygen inhalation  28 (47)  \u2026 \nCorticosteroid  27 (45)  \u2026 \nAntiviral treatment  41 (68)  \u2026 \nArbidol  22 (37)  \u2026 \nDarunavir and cobicistat  14 (23)  \u2026 \nLopinavir and ritonavir  10 (17)  \u2026 \nRemdesivir  9 (15)  \u2026 \nRibavirin  6 (10)  \u2026 \nInterferon inhalation  19 (32)  \u2026 \nImmune enhancer  23 (38)  \u2026 \nThymalfasin  19 (32)  \u2026 \nImmunoglobulin  6 (10)  \u2026 \nAbbreviations: COVID-19, coronavirus disease 2019; ESR, erythrocyte sedimentation rate; IQR, interquartile range.\nOpen in new tab\nPeripheral Lymphocyte Subset Alteration in COVID-19\nWe initially analyzed the levels of lymphocyte subsets by flow cytometry in whole blood.

The most common antiviral treatment was Arbidol administration (37%) and interferon inhalation (32%), and 50% of patients received more than 1 antiviral regimen. In immune enhancing treatment, 32% and 10% of patients received thymalfasin and immunoglobulin, respectively.\nAfter 1 week of treatment, 37 patients (67%) reached clinical response, and 18 (33%) had not reached clinical response. In responsive patients, total lymphocytes (P < .0001), CD8+ T cells (P < .0001), and B cells (P = .026) increased significantly after treatment, and no significant change was detected in CD4+ T cells, CD4+/CD8+ ratio, and NK cells (P > .05) (Figure 4). In nonresponsive patients, no significant change was detected in any lymphocyte subsets (P > .05). Comparatively, corticosteroid treatment increased total lymphocytes significantly, while antiviral treatment increased total lymphocytes, CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, and B cells significantly (data not shown). Immune enhancer had no obvious improvement in any subsets (data not shown).\nFigure 4.\nOpen in new tabDownload slide\nPeripheral lymphocyte subset alteration in clinically responsive and nonresponsive patients with COVID-19 pneumonia before (before T) and after 1 week of treatment (after T). *, P < .05; ***, P < .001; NS, not significant.\nIn multivariate analysis, posttreatment decrease in CD8+ T cells (P = .011) and B cells (P = .010) and increase in CD4+/CD8+ ratio (P = .032) indicated a poor efficacy when considering the factors of age, sex, disease severity on admission, oxygen inhalation, antiviral treatment, and use of corticosteroid and immune enhancer (Table 2).\nTable 2.\nMultivariate Analysis of Posttreatment Alteration of Peripheral Lymphocyte Subsets and Clinical Efficacy in Patients With COVID-19 Pneumonia\nMultivariate Analysisa\nPosttreatment Alteration No. (%) P Value Odds Ratio 95% CI\nTotal lymphocyte decrease  17 (36)  .071  0.113  .011\u20131.209 \nCD3+CD4+ T-cell decrease  16 (29)  .056  0.157  .024\u20131.047 \nCD3+CD8+ T-cell decrease  16 (29)  .011  0.056  .006\u2013.516 \nCD4+/CD8+ ratio increase  30 (56)  .032  0.099  .012\u2013.821 \nCD19+ B-cell decrease  14 (25)  .010  0.033  .002\u2013.439 \nCD16+CD56+ NK-cell decrease  32 (59)  .190  0.310  .054\u20131.787 \nAbbreviations: CI, confidence interval; COVID-19, coronavirus disease 2019.\naAdjusted by age, sex, disease severity on admission, oxygen inhalation, antiviral treatment, and use of corticosteroid and immune enhancer.\nOpen in new tab\nROC Curve Analysis\nROC curve analysis was conducted to evaluate the role of posttreatment alterations in peripheral lymphocyte subsets in predicting treatment efficacy (Figure 5).

As with MERS-Cov and SARS-Cov, SARS-CoV-2 is a member of the coronavirus family and belongs to the \u03b2-coronaviruses [8]. Infection by these coronavirus can cause sustained responses of cytokines and chemokines (namely a cytokine storm), leading to a high incidence of immune disorders and mortality [9].\nLymphocytes and their subsets play an important role in the maintenance of immune system function. As with immune diseases and other infectious disease, virus infection can also lead to dysregulation in the levels of lymphocyte subsets [10, 11]. Cellular surface molecules to CD3+, CD4+, CD8+, CD16+, CD19+, and CD56+ mark the lymphocyte T-helper cells (CD3+CD4+) and cytotoxic T cells (CD3+CD8+), B cells (CD19+), and NK cells (CD16+CD56+). These cells are involved in the humoral and cytotoxic immunity against viral infection. Thus, it is important to clarify the characteristics of lymphocyte subsets in COVID-19, which could provide novel insights to explore the immune mechanism.\nIn our study, lymphopenia was common in the patients with COVID-19 (72%), indicating an impairment of the immune system during the course of SARS-CoV-2 infection. In addition, decreases in CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, B cells, and NK cells were also observed in the COVID-19 patients. These alterations were also found in patients with pneumonia caused by MERS-Cov and SARS-Cov [12]. In the study by Cui et al on SARS, the incidence of lymphopenia was 84%, CD4+ T cells decreased in 100% of patients, CD8+ T cells decreased in 87%, B cells decreased in 76%, and NK cells decrease in 55% [13]. In the study by Assiri et al on MERS, lymphopenia occurred in 34% of patients [14]. Lymphopenia might be caused by virus attachment or indirectly by immune injuries from inflammatory mediators. Moreover, exudation of circulating lymphocytes into inflammatory lung tissues might also lead to lymphopenia.\nAmong COVID-19 patients, severe cases had a lower level of total lymphocytes, CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, and B cells than mild cases, which was similar to the alteration in SARS [15, 16]. CD8+ T-cell levels were negatively correlated with inflammatory indicators ESR, CRP, and IL-6, while the CD4+/CD8+ ratio was positively correlated. Total lymphocyte and CD4+ T-cell levels were negatively associated with ESR, and NK cells were negatively correlated with IL-6. These findings indicate a more obvious change in CD8+ T cells than in other lymphocyte subsets after SARS-CoV-2 infection. Thus, lymphocytes and their subsets, especially CD8+ T cells, might be a potential predictor for disease severity and clinical efficacy in COVID-19.\nAfter 1 week of treatment, in responsive cases there was a significant increase in total lymphocytes, CD8+ T cells, and B cells, but in nonresponsive cases there was no significant change in any lymphocyte subsets. However, these findings might be confounded by therapeutic factors. First, the lympholytic effects of corticosteroid could reduce the lymphocytes directly [17]. For the patients with corticosteroid treatment, the recovery of lymphocyte population might be weakened by the lympholytic effects of corticosteroid. Thus, we conducted a multivariate analysis to evaluate the effects of these potential confounders, and identified posttreatment decrease in CD8+ T cells and B cells and increase in CD4+/CD8+ ratio as independent predictors for poor clinical efficacy, especially CD8+ T cells. Moreover, we also found that corticosteroid treatment increased total lymphocytes significantly in comparison to the patients without corticosteroid treatment. The anti-inflammatory effects of corticosteroid might have contributed to the posttreatment increase in lymphocytes, which outweighed the lympholytic effects of corticosteroid.\nImportantly, CD8+ T cells have been shown to play a critical role in mediating viral clearance after acute respiratory infections of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza A virus (IAV), and human metapneumovirus [18, 19]. In animal experiments, the transfer of RSV- or IAV-immune CD8+ T cells into athymic mice significantly reduced viral titers [20, 21]. As in our results, cytotoxic immunity was involved in antiviral processes and the recovery of cytotoxic immune function (particularly CD8+ T cells) might be a reliable indicator of disease severity and recovery.\nIn conclusion, peripheral lymphocyte subset alteration showed a clear association with the clinical characteristics of COVID-19. CD8+ T cells tended to be an independent predictor for COVID-19 severity and treatment efficacy. These findings might help elucidate the pathogenesis and develop novel biomarkers and therapeutic strategies for COVID-19.\nNotes\nFinancial support.

Logistic regression models were used to analyze risk factors for LRT RV detection.\nResults\nTwo-hundred thirty-five HCT candidates or recipients had URT and LRT RV testing within 3 days. Among 115 subjects (49%) positive for a RV, 37% (42 of 115) had discordant sample pairs. Forty percent (17 of 42) of discordant pairs were positive in the LRT but negative in the URT. Discordance was common for adenovirus (100%), metapneumovirus (44%), rhinovirus (34%), and parainfluenza virus type 3 (28%); respiratory syncytial virus was highly concordant (92%). Likelihood of LRT detection was increased with URT detection (oods ratio [OR] = 73.7; 95% confidence interval [CI], 26.7\u2013204) and in cytomegalovirus-positive recipients (OR = 3.70; 95% CI, 1.30\u201310.0).\nConclusions\nHigh rates of discordance were observed for certain RVs. Bronchoalveolar lavage sampling may provide useful diagnostic information to guide management in symptomatic HCT candidates and recipients.\ndiagnostics, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, respiratory viruses\nIssue Section: Viruses\nRespiratory virus infections are a major cause of mortality and morbidity in hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) recipients [1\u20133]. Although symptomatic patients are frequently tested for viruses in the upper respiratory tract (URT), lower respiratory tract (LRT) testing with bronchoscopy and/or bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) is done less frequently, often only when prompted by clinical deterioration or for further evaluation of findings on radiologic imaging. Our study assessed the correlation between concurrent URT and LRT testing for respiratory viruses in HCT pretransplant candidates and posttransplant recipients.\nFew studies have examined differences in respiratory viral detection by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) between upper and lower tract samples. In immunocompetent children with chronic respiratory symptoms, paired nasopharyngeal (NP) aspirate and BAL samples showed discordance in approximately one third of patients, with positive NP aspirate/negative BAL discordance being most common [4]. In a small study of adults, the majority of which were HCT recipients or had a hematologic malignancy, with matched NP and BAL specimens, PCR-based NP testing for respiratory viruses in patients with clinical evidence of LRT disease had a high negative predictive value (NPV) and a lower positive predictive value (PPV) [5]. A larger study that included mostly immunocompromised patients concluded that if a pathogen (a respiratory virus or 1 of 3 bacterial pathogens detected by a multiplex PCR panel) was already identified from an NP sample, BAL testing is unlikely to provide additional information; however, a significant number (20%) of subjects had a pathogen detected in the BAL without a positive NP sample [6]. Likewise, in a study of lung transplant recipients, viral detection exclusively in the LRT was reported, and thus the authors caution on the use of URT sampling alone to rule out LRT infection in this population [7].\nOur study aimed (1) to describe discordance in HCT candidates and recipients and (2) to characterize specific viral, patient, and treatment risk factors that are associated with LRT detection. In addition, using quantitative PCR methodology, we aimed to define the role of viral load in respiratory virus LRT detection.\nMETHODS\nPatients and Viral Testing\nWe retrospectively identified HCT pretransplant candidates (within 90 days of HCT) and posttransplant recipients who underwent a BAL \u00b11 and \u00b13 days from an NP aspirate with testing of respiratory specimens by multiplex PCR testing for 11 respiratory viruses (adenovirus A\u2013F, human rhinovirus [HRV], influenza A and B, parainfluenza viruses [PIV] 1\u20134, human coronavirus, respiratory syncytial virus [RSV], and human metapneumovirus [HMPV]) between July 2009 and October 2016 [8]. In total, exactly 1000 HCT recipients underwent BAL respiratory virus testing during the study period. Clinically indicated bronchoscopy for LRT symptoms and/or radiographic abnormalities was determined by a pulmonologist. A BAL was generally performed to either rule-in respiratory viral involvement of the LRT and/or to rule out alternative causes for a LRT process. The BALs were collected per institutional standard practice using up to three 30-mL aliquots of normal saline. From this cohort, we then identified subjects who had URT viral PCR testing (from nasal wash or NP swab) within 3 days or within 1 day of the BAL. Only the first BAL per subject was included in the analysis.\nCycle thresholds (Ct) were used as a proxy for viral load and were compared between upper and lower respiratory sample pairs that were positive for the same virus for a given subject. Patient charts were reviewed for steroid use, radiology results, presence of copathogens, and potential alternate diagnoses. Steroid dose was defined as the highest dose of steroid in milligrams/kilogram per day expressed in equivalent doses of prednisone in the 2 weeks preceding the BAL. Computed tomography of the chest obtained within 1 week of the BAL were reviewed. We chose to categorize imaging results for the presence versus absence of a solitary nodule because patients with a solitary nodule may carry an alternative diagnosis and be at lower risk for viral LRT involvement. Copathogens were defined as follows: (1) bacterial - >10 000 colony-forming units of a Gram-positive organism or any Gram-negative organism on BAL; (2) viral - any other respiratory virus detected in BAL by multiplex PCR or cytomegalovirus (CMV) shell vial positivity; and (3) fungal - positive serum or BAL galactomannan, BAL fungal PCR positivity, or BAL fungal culture positivity (excluding Candida species) [9, 10]. Alternate diagnoses included diffuse alveolar hemorrhage based on finding progressive bloody fluid return on BAL [11].\nStatistical Analysis\nDiscordance was defined as either (1) a URT sample positive for a respiratory virus with the paired LRT sample negative for the same virus (termed positive/negative [P/N]) or (2) a URT sample negative for a respiratory virus with the paired LRT sample positive for the same virus (termed negative/positive [N/P]). Positive concordance was defined as both URT and LRT paired samples being positive for the same virus (P/P), and negative concordance was defined as both URT and LRT paired samples being negative for the same virus (N/N). The sensitivity and specificity for LRT detection by Ct value in the URT was plotted by generating a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. The Ct value for subjects with negative testing in the URT was set at 40, above the upper limit of assay detection, to allow inclusion of these subjects in the ROC analysis. Positive and negative predictive values for LRT infection were plotted as a function of all possible Ct value cutpoints. Logistic regression models were used to evaluate odds ratios (OR) for the association between candidate risk factors and viral LRT detection. Patients with more than 1 virus detected in the URT (N = 12) were excluded from the logistic regression analysis. All patients in the cohort with LRT detection of adenovirus also had adenovirus testing of the plasma by PCR for viremia. Patients with disseminated adenovirus as evidenced by a positive plasma PCR at the time of LRT detection (N = 4) were excluded from the logistic regression and ROC analysis. Variables with P \u2264 .2 in univariable analysis were candidates for multivariable models and were retained in the models if they remained significant themselves or modified the effect of another factor (confounder). Covariates evaluated as candidate risk factors for inclusion in multivariable models are listed in Table 1. Statistical significance was defined as 2-sided P < .05. SAS version 9.4 TS1M3 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC) was used for all statistical analyses.\nTable 1.\nDemographics of Entire Cohort (N = 235) and of Subset With \u00b11 Day Between Upper and Lower Respiratory Tract Testing (N = 131)\nVariables Categories \u00b13 Days (N = 235) \u00b11 Day (N = 131)\nGender  Female  93 (40%)  52 (40%) \n  Male  142 (60%)  79 (60%) \nRace  White  177 (75%)  98 (75%) \n  Non-White  56 (24%)  33 (25%) \n  Unknown  2 (1%)   \nRecipient age at transplant  0\u201320  28 (12%)  18 (14%) \n  >21 to <60  149 (63%)  79 (60%) \n  \u226560  58 (25%)  34 (26%) \nTransplant number   1  186 (79%)  107 (79%) \n  2  44 (19%)  26 (19%) \n  3  5 (2%)  2 (1%) \nYear of transplant  2009\u20132011  97 (41%)  103 (79%) \n  2012\u20132013  70 (30%)  26 (20%) \n  2014\u20132016  68 (29%)  2 (2%) \nDonor type  Allo/Unrelated  197 (84%)  113 (86%) \n  Auto  38 (16%)  18 (14%) \nConditioning regimen  Non-myeloablative   81 (34%)  48 (37%) \n  Myeloablative without high-dose TBI (<1200)  107 (46%)  59 (45%) \n  Myeloablative with high-dose TBI (\u22651200)  47 (20%)  24 (18%) \nRecipient CMV serostatus  -  78 (33%)  41 (31%) \n  +  156 (66%)  90 (69%) \nDonor CMV serostatus  -  150 (64%)  81 (62%) \n  +  83 (35%)  50 (38%) \nDay of BAL after transplant  Median (IQR)  49.0 (13.0\u2013159.0)  57.0 (15.0\u2013179.0) \nGap between BAL and nasal swab  Median (IQR)  1.0 (1.0\u20132.0)  1.0 (0.0\u20131.0) \n  Mean (STD)  1.5 (0.9)  0.7 (0.4) \n  Median (range)  1.0 (0.0\u20133.0)  1.0 (0.0\u20131.0) \nHighest dose of steroids received in the 14 days before BALa  0 to <1  181 (77%)  0.3 (0.0\u20131.0) \n  1 to <2  33 (14%)  0.8 (1.8) \n  \u22652  19 (8%)  0.3 (0.0\u201313.5) \nWBC on day of/closest day of BAL (cells/\u00b5L)  \u22641000  73 (31%)  38 (29%) \n  >1000  162 (69%)  93 (71%) \nANC on day of/closest day of BAL (cells/\u00b5L)  \u2264100  46 (20%)  24 (18%) \n  100\u2013500  27 (11%)  14 (11%) \n  >500  162 (69%)  93 (71%) \nLymphocyte on day of/closest day of BAL (cells/\u00b5L)  \u2264100  64 (27%)  29 (22%) \n  100\u2013500  88 (37%)  55 (42%) \n  >500  82 (35%)  47 (36%) \n  Missing  1 (0%)   \nMonocyte on day of/closest day of BAL (cells/\u00b5L)  \u2264100  88 (37%)  49 (37%) \n  100\u2013500  71 (30%)  42 (32%) \n  >500  75 (32%)  40 (31%) \nImaging findings  All others  217 (92%)  124 (95%) \n  Solitary nodule  8 (3%)  3 (2%) \n  Missing  10 (4%)  4 (3%) \nBAL before HCT  No  203 (86%)  119 (91%) \n  Yes  32 (14%)  12 (9%) \nAbbreviations: ALC, absolute lymphocyte count; allo, allogeneic stem cell transplant; AMC, absolute monocyte count; ANC, absolute neutrophil count; auto, autologous stem cell transplant; BAL, bronchoalveolar lavage; CMV, cytomegalovirus; HCT, hematopoietic cell transplant; IQR, interquartile range; STD, standard deviation; TBI, total body irradiation; WBC, white blood cell count.\naEquivalent dose of prednisone in mg/kg per day.\nOpen in new tab\nRESULTS\nCohort Description\nWe identified 235 subjects with a BAL performed during the study period who had URT RV testing within 3 days of the BAL. Table 1 shows the demographic characteristics of the cohort. The majority of patients (63%) were between 21 and 60 years of age, and 60% were male. The majority of patients (84%) underwent allogeneic transplant. Only 14% had a BAL before HCT. The median number of days between BAL and nasal swab was 1 day. Table 1 also shows the demographics for a subset of 131 subjects in this cohort with URT and LRT testing within 1 day of each other; the subset is largely representative of the whole cohort.\nConcordant Versus Discordant Results\nAmong the 235 sample pairs in the overall cohort, 49% (115 of 235) were positive for a respiratory virus in either the URT or LRT. Of these, 63% (73 of 115) were concordant positive for the same virus in both upper and lower tracts (P/P). Discordance was noted in 37% (42 of 115) of sample pairs. Among the discordant pairs, 60% (25 of 42) were positive in the URT but negative in the LRT (P/N), and 40% (17 of 42) were negative in the URT but positive in the LRT (N/P). Figure 1 shows the distribution of concordance/discordance for pairs with at least 1 test positive for individual viruses. In patients who underwent BAL within 3 days of an NP aspirate, discordance between URT and LRT results was observed at the highest rate for HMPV (9 positive pairs, 33% N/P and 11% P/N), HRV (44 positive pairs, 7% N/P and 27% P/N), PIV2 (2 positive pairs, 50% N/P), and PIV3 (25 positive pairs, 12% N/P and 16% P/N) (Figure 1A). All 9 pairs with a positive adenovirus result were discordant (56% N/P and 44% P/N). Respiratory syncytial virus had the highest frequency and percentage of concordant results (13 positive pairs, 92% concordant with 8% P/N and no N/P pairs). Similar patterns of discordance were observed when analyzing patients who underwent BAL within 1 day of an NP aspirate (Figure 1B) and when analyzing the subset of patients who underwent BAL after a positive NP aspirate (Supplemental Figure 1). The Ct values of all viruses grouped together between the URT and LRT in concordant pairs were not significantly different when the BAL was performed either \u00b13 days (\u0394CtURT-LRT = \u22120.1, P = .90) or \u00b11 day (\u0394CtURT-LRT = \u22120.57, P = .56) from collection of the URT specimen.\nFigure 1.\nOpen in new tabDownload slide\nResults of upper respiratory tract (URT) and lower respiratory tract (LRT) sample testing with concordance or discordance by specific virus (represented as result from URT/LRT with N = negative and P = positive).

No significant differences were observed in the proportion of copathogens or alternate diagnoses in subjects with discordant testing versus concordant positive results by Fisher's exact test.\nFigure 2.\nOpen in new tabDownload slide\nDistribution of copathogens and alternate diagnoses in subjects with concordant positive pairs (N = 73) and discordant pairs (N = 42).

DAH, diffuse alveolar hemorrhage.\nRisk for Lower Respiratory Tract Detection\nIn a univariable analysis of risk factors for LRT detection, detection of virus in the URT (OR = 54.9; 95% confidence interval [CI], 22.4\u2013135) and recipient CMV seropositivity (OR = 2.44; 95% CI, 1.20\u20134.76) were associated with an increased risk for LRT detection (Table 2). Of note, factors not found to be associated with LRT detection included conditioning regimen, transplant type (allogeneic versus autologous), steroid use, presence of a solitary nodule on imaging, or lymphocyte, neutrophil, monocyte, or overall white blood cell counts. In a multivariable analysis, detection of virus in the URT (OR = 73.7; 95% CI, 26.7\u2013204) and recipient CMV seropositivity (OR = 3.70; 95% CI, 1.30\u201310.0) remained strongly associated with an increased risk for LRT detection (Table 2). An analysis of the subset of patients who underwent BAL within 1 day of the NP aspirate and a separate analysis of the subset of only HCT recipients who underwent BAL after transplantation yielded similar results (Supplementary Tables 1 and 2). The proportion of patients with a positive LRT sample was similar between patients with URT testing before LRT testing (28% or 57 of 201) versus after LRT testing (28% or 5 of 18). Thirty-day mortality in patients with positive respiratory viral testing in the LRT was 23.0% (14 of 61) compared with 15.2% (24 of 158) in those with negative testing, although this difference was not statistically significant (P = .23).\nTable 2.\nUnivariate and Multivariate Analyses of Risk Factors for Respiratory Viral Detection in the LRT Among HCT Candidates or Recipientsa (N = 219)\nUnivariate Analysis Multivariate Analysis\nCovariates Categories OR (95% CI) P Values OR (95% CI) P Values\nGender  Female  0.87 (.47\u20131.59)  .642     \n  Male  1       \nRace  White  1       \n  Non-White  1.50 (.76\u20132.96)  .246     \n  Unknown  N/A  .989     \nRecipient age at transplant  0\u201320  1       \n  >21 to <60  0.70 (.29\u20131.71)  .438     \n  \u226560  1.00 (.38\u20132.66)  1     \nYear of transplant  2009\u20132011  1    1   \n  2012\u20132013  0.92 (.46\u20131.83)  .811  1.46 (0.47\u20134.50)  .139 \n  2014\u20132016  0.47 (.22\u20131.01)  .053  0.42 (0.14\u20131.31)  .057 \nTransplant number  1  1       \n  2  1.14 (.54\u20132.42)  .729     \n  3  4.14 (.67\u201325.6)  .126     \nDonor type  Allo/Unrelated  0.73 (.34\u20131.57)  .424     \n  Auto  1       \nConditioning regimen  Non-myeloablative   1       \n  Myeloablative without high-dose TBI (<1200)  0.79 (.41\u20131.53)  .491     \n              Myeloablative with high-dose TBI (\u22651200)  0.74 (.31\u20131.74)  .487     \n            Donor CMV serostatus  -  1       \n  +  1.33 (.72\u20132.44)  .355     \nRecipient CMV serostatus  -  1    1   \n  +  2.44 (1.20\u20134.76)  .013   3.70 (1.30\u201310.0)  .015  \nGap between BAL and nasal swab (in days)  as continuous  1.11 (.81\u20131.52)  .519     \nHighest dose of steroids received in the 14 days before BALb  0 to <1  1       \n  1 to <2  1.16 (.51\u20132.63)  .718     \n  \u22652  1.11 (.37\u20133.34)  .847     \nHighest dose of steroids received in the 14 days before BALb  as continuous  1.30 (.96\u20131.77)  .094  1.02 (0.62\u20131.67)  .94 \nWBC on day of/closest day of BAL (cells/\u00b5L)  \u22641000  1       \n  >1000  1.02 (.54\u20131.94)  .943     \nANC on day of/closest day of BAL (cells/\u00b5L)  \u2264100  1       \n  >100  1.20 (.56\u20132.56)  .637     \nLymphocyte on day of/closest day of BAL (cells/\u00b5L)  \u2264100  1       \n  >100  1.23 (.63\u20132.43)  .546     \nMonocyte on day of/closest day of BAL (cells/\u00b5L)  \u2264100  1       \n  >100  0.90 (.49\u20131.66)  .743     \nImaging findings  All others  1       \n  Solitary nodule  1.99 (.43\u20139.17)  .376     \nRespiratory viral detection in the URT  Negative  1    1   \n  Positive  54.9 (22.4\u2013135)  <.001  73.7 (26.7\u2013204)  <.001 \nAbbreviations: ALC, absolute lymphocyte count; allo, allogeneic stem cell transplant; AMC, absolute monocyte count; ANC, absolute neutrophil count; auto, autologous stem cell transplant; BAL, bronchoalveolar lavage; CI, confidence interval; CMV, cytomegalovirus; HCT, hematopoietic cell transplant; LRT, lower respiratory tract; N/A, not applicable; OR, odds ratio; TBI, total body irradiation; URT, upper respiratory tract; WBC, white blood cell count.\naTwelve patients with more than 1 respiratory virus in the URT were excluded from the analysis.

A Ct cut point of 27.5 in the URT had a sensitivity of 70% and a specificity of 98%, whereas a cutpoint of 32.0 had a sensitivity of 80% and a specificity of 96% (Figure 3A). Using a Ct cutoff of 27.5 in the URT with a prevalence of LRT infection of 28% (61 of 219) in the cohort, the PPV was 94% and the NPV was 90% for LRT infection (Figure 3B). With higher Ct values in the URT, the PPV declined whereas the NPV for LRT infection increased. For comparison, any positive test in the URT had a PPV of 76% and a NPV of 95%.\nFigure 3.\nOpen in new tabDownload slide\nSensitivity, specificity, and predictive values for lower respiratory tract (LRT) infection based on cycle threshold (Ct) values in the upper respiratory tract (URT).

We demonstrate high discordance rates for HRV, HMPV, PIV3, and adenovirus between the URT and LRT. Furthermore, we identified risk factors for detection of respiratory viruses in the lungs of HCT candidates and recipients, including viral detection in the NP and recipient CMV seropositivity.\nBefore the advent of molecular testing, a high rate of discordance was observed with rapid antigen detection assays which had a sensitivity of 15% in URT specimens and 89% in LRT specimens from immunocompromised adults [12]. Discordance between molecular diagnostic testing of URT and LRT specimens has also been reported in other studies, particularly in immunocompromised populations, where 79%\u201386% of patients with a positive LRT specimen had a concordant URT specimen [6, 13, 14]. The positive and NPVs of URT testing were 86%\u201388% and 89%\u201394%, respectively. In a different study of HCT recipients with HMPV or RSV detected in the LRT, 33% had a discordant negative test for HMPV, whereas no patients had a discordant negative test for RSV [2]. In the present study, we found high levels of discordance with 37% of sample pairs among subjects with positive testing showing discordance between URT and LRT testing for any virus. Although the sample sizes were too small for each virus to perform statistical testing, discordance rates were highest for HMPV, HRV, adenovirus, and PIV3. Of note, this discrepancy was present also among patients with URT specimens obtained within 1 day of the BAL. Human metapneumovirus LRT disease is associated with high mortality in HCT recipients, and our results suggest that a negative URT specimen may not be sufficient to rule out LRT infection [2]. We noted that adenovirus testing showed discordance in every subject with the virus. Reactivation in other tissues followed by viremia and dissemination to the lungs may have contributed to this finding. In contrast, RSV testing showed an approximately 100% concordance, suggesting that patients with RSV detected in the URT and clinical/radiographic evidence of LRT involvement may be presumed to have RSV in the LRT. These patients could be treated accordingly for RSV pneumonia and also be enrolled for clinical trials. We have previously categorized LRT infection with respiratory viruses into groups depending on viral detection in the LRT, where proven LRTI is defined as a positive LRT sample (BAL, lung biopsy, or autopsy specimen) with radiographic abnormality, probable LRTI is defined as a positive LRT sample without radiographic abnormality, and possible LRTI is defined as a positive URT sample with radiographic abnormality but no LRT sampling. We have shown that subjects with possible LRTI have outcomes more similar to URT infection for both PIV and RSV, and that subjects with proven/probable LRTI have worse outcomes including need for oxygen, oxygen-free days, and mortality [15, 16]. These results suggest that LRT testing to stratify patients into possible versus proven/probable LRTI can provide useful prognostic information in HCT recipients. This may become increasingly important because new antivirals are in development, many of which are being evaluated depending on the site of infection (upper versus lower tract). Our study included 17 patients positive for a respiratory virus in the LRT but negative in the URT. Five viruses, namely, adenovirus influenza A, PIV2, PIV3, HMPV, and HRV, had N/P discordance. Thus, proximal URT testing did not identify the LRT pathogen in these cases, including viruses that may warrant treatment with current antivirals (influenza A and adenovirus) as well as viruses for which specific antiviral therapy is being developed (PIV and HMPV).\nThe probability of detecting virus in the LRT was increased in patients with virus detected in the URT. Other studies have found an association between higher respiratory viral loads and more severe disease manifestations [17\u201319]. We found that lower Ct values in the URT were associated with higher PPVs for LRT infection. However, the NPV appeared to plateau such that the NPV at a Ct value of 27.5 was similar to the NPV of a negative test in the URT (90% vs 95%, respectively). It is important to note that because even a negative PCR in the URT is not fully predictive, Ct values for viruses detected in the URT cannot be used on their own to rule out LRT involvement.\nWe also found that CMV-seropositive HCT recipients had an increased risk for LRT respiratory virus detection. We have previously reported recipient CMV seropositivity as a risk factor for respiratory virus acquisition and progression to LRT infection after HCT [20, 21]. Another study reported an association between CMV reactivation and RSV infection after HCT with the development of severe pneumonia [22]. Cytomegalovirus seropositivity and reactivation have been associated with increased morbidity, mortality, and graft-versus-host disease after HCT [23\u201325]. The pathogenesis of CMV infection and disease is complex with several immunomodulating interactions between CMV and the immune system, including effects on human leukocyte antigen expression and cytokine production (reviewed in reference [26]). Our findings here suggest that increased risk of LRT infection may be another indirect effect of CMV.\nFurthermore, we observed a trend towards decreased risk of detecting virus in the LRT in patients transplanted between 2014 and 2016 and a trend towards decreased risk in patients transplanted between 2012 and 2013 compared to 2009 and 2011. It is possible this could have been secondary to a decrease in virus detected in the URT in the later years (31% between 2009 and 2011, 24% between 2012 and 2013, and 17% between 2014 and 2016) because a negative result in the URT was strongly associated with a lower risk for LRT detection. This reduction in URT respiratory viral detection may also have been secondary to improvements in infection control practices. Alternatively, the trend towards reduced risk of LRT detection in later years may be a reflection of practice changes either with (1) delaying transplants in patients with positive testing for respiratory viruses in the URT or (2) fewer bronchoscopies being performed now compared to in the past [27]. This could have led to a sampling bias in more recent years in which a bronchoscopy was more often performed when lung disease due to an alternative, nonrespiratory viral, process was suspected.\nWe also sought to understand the differences in viral load observed in concordant upper and lower samples. There was no significant difference between viral loads in the upper versus lower tract when analyzing all viruses together in patients with a BAL within 3 days or 1 day of URT testing. One argument against early bronchoscopy to test for viral LRT involvement includes the notion that viruses in the URT may be \u201cpushed\u201d into the LRT during the procedure itself. Lower respiratory tract positivity could also simply reflect upper tract secretions that are aspirated during the procedure, similar to the finding of oral flora in bacterial cultures of a BAL. The finding of several cases of positive testing in the nose yet negative testing in the lungs argues against the \u201cpushing down\u201d of viruses from the URT to the LRT during bronchoscopy and against the detection of viruses in the LRT as an artifact of contamination from the URT during bronchoscopy. The sample size was too small to support analysis of Ct values for individual viruses.\nOur study has several limitations. First, even though our sample size was relatively larger than other studies of immunocompromised patients with paired URT and LRT sampling, we could not evaluate risk factors for discordance for individual viruses. Second, data were collected retrospectively, and, therefore, need for sampling of the URT and LRT was determined by the clinician. The patient population was limited to those who underwent BAL within 1 or 3 days of an NP aspirate because viral detection in the LRT was an outcome measure, and therefore risk factors may differ with patients who undergo only URT testing. Third, our primary analysis focused on HCT recipients who had undergone BAL within 3 days from an NP aspirate. This could be considered too long a time period. More important, however, the results from this analysis were similar to that for patients who had undergone BAL within 1 day of an NP aspirate. Fourth, differences in sampling from the LRT by BAL and URT by swabbing may contribute to differences in Ct values. The higher collection volume for BALs compared with NP aspirates (approximately 30 vs 5 mL) would generally lead to higher Ct values in LRT specimens due to greater dilution. Fifth, antiviral therapy in patients with influenza or RSV detected in NP aspirates may have affected the detection of these viruses in the BAL. However, we found that almost every case of RSV infection was concordant and only 1 case of influenza was discordant P/N. Sixth, because copathogens and alternative diagnoses were identified in many patients, we cannot definitively conclude whether LRT symptoms, signs, or radiographic abnormalities were caused specifically by the respiratory virus, the copathogen, and/or a concomitant noninfectious process. Finally, Ct values may not be as generalizable between different assays compared with a true viral load measured in copies/milliliter. Even though most currently available commercial PCR assays do not include Ct values, our study shows the predictive value of these results for LRT infection.\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn summary, our data demonstrate discordance between URT and LRT respiratory virus detection for several common respiratory viruses. We suggest that early LRT viral testing could provide useful diagnostic information that may affect management of respiratory viral infections in certain HCT candidates and recipients.\nSupplementary Data\nSupplementary materials are available at The Journal of Infectious Diseases online.

The epidemiology of COVID-19 has recently become clearer as incident cases continue to rise and researchers refine estimates of the severity, transmissibility, and populations affected. Based on available data, COVID-19 is efficiently transmitted in the community, and the proportion of infections leading to severe illness is particularly high among adults \u226550 years of age and among individuals with comorbid health conditions. Although rare, severe cases have also been reported among younger individuals. Thus far, the estimated basic reproductive number of COVID-19 is higher than that of influenza [2], as is the case fatality risk for adults and older individuals.\nAn estimated 80% of COVID-19 cases are mild [1]. This is not a glass-half-full statistic, because 20% of infections result in clinically severe cases that have the potential to overwhelm already overburdened health facilities. Given the lack of vaccines and effective antivirals, nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) are the most effective available interventions for local and global control and mitigation of COVID-19. To date, measures aimed at slowing introduction of infection globally have included travel restrictions, isolation of confirmed cases, and quarantine of exposed persons. In the United States, NPIs have reduced the number of infected persons entering the country, but recent outbreaks in multiple US states make it clear that these measures have delayed but not prevented community transmission. In 2009, NPIs were able to delay large epidemic waves of pandemic influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 in some locations until after the summer, because influenza transmission tends to be reduced by higher temperatures and humidity. It is unclear whether COVID-19 transmission will be heavily affected by seasonal weather variation, given that transmission is now occurring in multiple tropical and subtropical locations.\nGiven the many uncertainties regarding the potential for widespread community transmission of COVID-19, community mitigation measures to curb local transmission must be carefully considered and applied where possible. In the 1918/1919 influenza pandemic, timely and sustained use of a broad set of NPIs including school closures, banning of mass gatherings, mandatory wearing of masks, isolation of ill persons, and appropriate disinfection and/or hygiene measures reduced mortality in several US cities [3]. These measures decreased transmission, spread the epidemic over a longer period of time, reduced the height of the epidemic peak, and reduced the overall number of infected persons and overall health impact. In this study, we discuss NPIs that may be most effective given our current understanding of COVID-19 epidemiology (Table 1).\nTable 1.\nCharacteristics and Transmission Dynamics of COVID-19, SARS, MERS and Influenza\nCharacteristic COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2 Infection) SARS-CoV/MERS-CoV Infection Influenza Virus Infection (Including Seasonal Epidemics and Pandemics)\nClinical severity profile  Can cause severe disease, most infections mild  Causes almost exclusively severe disease  Can cause severe disease, most infections mild \nInfection fatality riska  Unclear but could be in the range of 0.5% to 1%  10% to 30%  Seasonal: \u22640.1% 1918/1919 pandemic: 2% \nIncubation period  Mean 5\u20136 days, upper limit approximately 14 days  Mean 3\u20135 days, upper limit approximately 14 days  Mean 1 day, upper limit approximately 3 days \nBasic reproductive numberb  Thought to be approximately 1.5 to 3.0  SARS: 1.5 to 4 MERS: 0.5 to 1  Thought to be approximately 1.5 to 2.0 \nModes of transmission  Not established but presumed to be mainly respiratory droplets and spread via fomites.

Hand hygiene effectively reduces the transmission of respiratory infections through indirect contact in the community setting, and it should be practiced by ill individuals, their contacts, and the larger population to limit the risk of transmission through fomites [4]. Most coronaviruses, including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), are inactivated by alcohol-based hand sanitizers and disinfectants such as bleach. Environmental disinfection with appropriate sanitizers is also recommended [4].\nBecause hand hygiene does not affect direct transmission of COVID-19 by respiratory droplets or aerosols, face masks have been widely deployed by at-risk populations in China and some other locations in Asia, for example, in Hong Kong and Taiwan. The efficacy of face masks among healthy individuals is unclear, but masks may protect others, particularly healthcare workers, from actively symptomatic individuals with COVID-19. However, the combination of masks and hand hygiene has been shown to reduce transmission of respiratory viruses and serves to highlight that layering of NPIs is more effective at reducing disease transmission than any NPI alone [4]. Mask use could be recommended for ill persons, for uninfected persons who are caring for ill persons, and for those interacting in highly crowded settings where widespread community transmission is known to be occurring. If face masks are widely recommended, demand may quickly exhaust limited supplies that are most critical for reducing transmission in high-exposure settings such as hospitals and clinics. This balance requires careful attention. N95 masks should be preserved for medical personnel only.\nISOLATION OF ILL AND QUARANTINE OF EXPOSED PERSONS\nIn some locations around the world, confirmed cases of COVID-19 are being medically isolated in hospitals, and their close contacts are being carefully traced and quarantined at home or in designated quarantine facilities. This requires intense laboratory surveillance to pick up COVID-19 cases in the community, including cases with mild illness. To date (March 13, 2020), these containment measures appear to have been able to prevent sustained local transmission in Hong Kong, Singapore, and Taiwan.\nMedical isolation of cases has been feasible in outbreaks of SARS and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) because infections are generally severe and of a limited number, but similar practices are less useful in influenza epidemics because of the huge number of cases and difficulties in identifying mild infections [5]. Quarantine of asymptomatic exposed persons has also been used to contain SARS and MERS outbreaks, but it will not be feasible in designated quarantine facilities if there is widespread community transmission of COVID-19. Moreover, quarantine measures can be costly, challenging to enforce, and introduce location-specific ethical and legal challenges that may hamper control efforts. Perhaps the most important NPIs in this domain are strong, coordinated public health messaging to self-isolate when ill. Previous work has demonstrated that the speed with which infected populations are quarantined, through a combination of hospital-based isolation and self-quarantining, accelerates during epidemics of emerging disease such as COVID-19 [6]. Public health messaging to leverage and augment this natural acceleration of isolation and quarantine practices may be critical in the context of widespread community transmission. Expanding access to surveillance and diagnostic testing is also critical to identify transmission clusters where isolation is most important.\nCOMMUNITY MITIGATION MEASURES\nIn most locations, containment efforts are likely to be ineffective in preventing epidemics, and public health measures will be needed to mitigate the pandemic impact at a local level [7]. As local epidemics progress towards a peak in incidence, there will be a surge in healthcare demand, and particularly the demand for intensive care, to a level that is likely to overwhelm the healthcare system. The aim of mitigation is to reduce this surge as much as possible. Community mitigation measures generally promote social distancing to reduce transmission, but they can be extremely disruptive and have population-specific economic consequences [5]. Similar to influenza pandemics, mitigation measures that could be considered for COVID-19 include the temporary closure of schools and workplaces and cancellation of mass gatherings for a period of time to flatten the epidemic peak. Voluntary avoidance measures, where people choose to stay at home more often, will also contribute to social distancing.\nCareful consideration of the positive and negative effects of school closures in the United States is critical, because prolonged closures disproportionately affect low-income families and must include contingency plans for providing free meals and other programming to families that rely on school-based learning and economic support. Currently, it appears that children can be infected as easily as adults; however, the risk of severe disease is very low in this group. Given that children can be infected, it is reasonable to believe that they would also be contagious, although the importance of children in community transmission of COVID-19 has not yet been quantified. Closure of workplaces introduces similar ethical concerns, because low-income workers often have limited ability to work from home without loss of pay and other benefits. Careful evaluation should be given to the timing and duration of community mitigation measures to maximize the beneficial epidemiologic effects while minimizing social and economic harm.\nConclusions\nGiven the evolving picture of the COVID-19 pandemic, the application of layered, multifaceted, location- and population-specific NPIs will need to be considered and initiated quickly to curb widespread transmission. When NPIs are \u201creactive\u201d to widespread transmission, instead of \u201cproactive\u201d to the potential for transmission, they often fail to reduce rates of illness. The types of proactive measures we describe here were successful in mitigating the 1918/1919 influenza pandemic and may be just as valuable almost a century later.\nNotes\nAcknowledgments.

Limited data are available for children with COVID-19, especially for infected infants.\nMethods\nWe report a 55-day-old case with COVID-19 confirmed in China and describe the identification, diagnosis, clinical course, and treatment of the patient, including the disease progression from day 7 to day 11 of illness.\nResults\nThis case highlights that children with COVID-19 can also present with multiple organ damage and rapid disease changes.\nConclusions\nWhen managing such infant patients with COVID-19, frequent and careful clinical monitoring is essential.\nCOVID-19 pneumonia, heart damage, liver injury\nTopic: liver injuries infant pneumonia heart sars-cov-2 covid-19\nIssue Section: Brief Report\nA 55-day-old otherwise healthy female infant of mixed feeding became ill with rhinorrhoea and a dry cough on January 28, 2020. She was admitted to our hospital on February 2, 2020. Before the onset of symptoms, she had been taken to Lu\u2019an, Hubei Province by her parents for a family party between January 16 and January 24, 2020. At that party, the infant\u2019s uncle and aunt, Wuhan residents, presented with cough and fever. Then, the child\u2019s parents were diagnosed with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on January 31, 2020 based on their symptoms, chest imaging, and viral ribonucleic acid (RNA) in pharyngeal swabs. The nasopharyngeal swab obtained from the infant also tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) on real-time, reverse-transcription polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR) assay.\nPATIENTS AND METHODS\nOn admission, the physical examination showed that vital signs were within normal ranges except for pharyngeal hyperemia. A chest computed tomographic (CT) scan was reported as showing patchy shadows and ground-glass opacity in the right lung (Figure 1A). Laboratory results reflected there were alterations in hepatic function measures and mildly abnormal myocardial zymogram (Table 1). Lymphocyte count, platelet count, CD8+ T lymphocyte count, and serum immunoglobulin (Ig)M level were all mildly elevated. Other laboratory examinations including hemoglobin, D-dimer, activated partial thromboplastin time, prothrombin time, C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and renal function in this patient showed no abnormalities. Both rotavirus in stool and cytomegalovirus deoxyribonucleic acid in blood were negative. Based on the definite contact history and the above test results, the infant was diagnosed as COVID-19 (ordinary type). She was isolated and treated empirically with the inhaled interferon \u03b1-1b (15 \u03bcg, bid), amoxicillin potassium clavulanate (30 mg/kg, q8h, intravenous glucose tolerance test [IVGTT]), reduced glutathione, ursodeoxycholic acid, and traditional Chinese medicine lotus qingwen.\nTable 1.\nLaboratory Indicators on Admission and the Changes After Treatment\nMeasure Reference Range Illness Day 6, Hospital Day 1 Illness Day 9, Hospital Day 4 Illness Day 15, Hospital Day 10\nWhite cell count (\u00d7109/L)  6\u201318  7.96  10.04  9.46 \nLymphocyte count (\u00d7109/L)  1.1\u20133.2  5.22a  6.59a  6.25a \nNeutrophil count (\u00d7109/L)  1.8\u20136.3  1.87  2.44  2.01 \nPlatelet count (\u00d7109/L)  125\u2013350  406a  449a  604a \nHemoglobin (g/L)  95\u2013145  112  91b  101 \nErythrocyte sedimentation rate (mm/h)  0\u201320  7  2  - \nC-reactive protein (mg/L)  0\u20135  0.56  0.63  0.32 \nProcalcitonin (ng/mL)  0\u20130.046  0.15a  0.11a  - \nAlanine aminotransferase (U/L)  7\u201340  84a  49a  33 \nAspartate aminotransferase (Ul/L)  13\u201335  100a  47a  35 \nTotal bilirubin (\u03bcmol/L)  3.4\u201320.5  33.7a  20.1a  10.9 \nDirect bilirubin (\u03bcmol/L)  0\u20138.6  25.2a  16.6a  7 \nTotal bile acid (\u03bcmol/L)  0\u201310  154.4a  89.8a  46.4a \nCreatine kinase isoenzyme (U/L)  0\u201325  46a  -  25 \n\u03b1-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase (U/L)  44\u2013148  237a  -  143 \nTroponin I (\u03bcg/L)  0\u20130.0156  -  0.025a  - \nCreatinine (\u03bcmol/L)  15\u201345  20  19  21 \nBlood urea nitrogen (mmol/L)  1.8\u20136  3.61  2.09  2.15 \nSerum immunoglobulin M (g/L)  0.06\u20130.21  0.66a  -  - \nCD8+ T-cell count (cell/\u03bcL)  400\u20131700  2208a  -  - \nD-dimer (\u03bcg/mL)  0\u20131.5  0.54  -  - \nActivated partial thromboplastin time (seconds)  21.1\u201336.5  30.6  -  - \nProthrombin time (seconds)  9.2\u201312.2  9.7  -  - \nRotavirus in stool  Negative  Negative     \nCytomegalovirus DNA in blood  Negative  Negative     \nAbbreviations: DNA, deoxyribonucleic acid.\naThe value in the patient was above normal.\nbThe value in the patient was below normal.\nOpen in new tab\nFigure 1.\nOpen in new tabDownload slide\nOpen in new tabDownload slide\nOpen in new tabDownload slide\nChest computed tomographic (CT) images of a 55-day-old female infant with COVID-19. NOTE: The scanning condition was low-dose CT with 80-kV tube voltage and 23- to 26-mAs tube current (automatic). (A) The CT images on admission (illness day 6): multiple patchy shadows and ground-glass opacity in the upper and lower lobes of the right lung (black arrow). (B) The CT images on hospital day 4 (illness day 9): compared with day 6 of illness, the lesion progressed and the range widened (gray arrow), accompanied with small consolidation shadow and a few stripe shadows (black arrow). (C) The CT images on on hospital day 11 (illness day 16): compared with day 9 of illness, the inflammation of the right lung was obviously absorbed. Small patchy shadows with increased density and a few strip-like shadows were still observed in the upper lobe of the right lung (black arrow).\nOn days 2 through 6 of hospitalization (days 7 through 11 of illness), the patient became sicker, presenting as a frequently productive cough accompanied by occasional tachycardia (150\u2013170 beats per minute). Decreased arterial oxygen partial pressures (lowest PaO2, 56 mmHg) with elevated lactic acid while breathing ambient air were found in the morming of hospital day 4 (Figure 2). She received sputum suctioning. Meanwhile, oxygen was supplied through a nasal cannula immediately, and ambroxol was administrated to eliminate phlegm. Because there was a trend of aggravation in the disease grade, a second chest CT scan was performed in the evening of hospital day 4 (illness day 9), which showed evidence of progressive pneumonia (Figure 1B). These radiographic findings coincided with a progress in respiratory status. Abnormal myocardial zymogram on admission and increased troponin I (0.025 \u03bcg per liter) on hospital day 4 indicated myocardia injury, so intravenous sodium creatine phosphate was added to protect her heart. During this period, the baby still had a good appetite, without diarrhea, oliguria, or shock. On day 11 of the patient\u2019s illness, a stool specimen was collected for the first time to detect the viral RNA, and the PCR result showed positive.\nFigure 2.\nOpen in new tabDownload slide\nDisease course of the infected infant and important information about her parents.\nRESULTS\nOn days 7 through 12 of hospitalization (days 12 through 17 of illness), the patient\u2019s clinical condition gradually improved and the respiratory symptoms disappeared on hospital day 11. Supplemental oxygen was discontinued, and her oxygen saturation values were 94% to 100% while breathing ambient air. The heart rate fluctuated between 120 and 140 beats per minute. The laboratory examinations on hospital day 10 showed elevated myocardial zymogram and abnormal liver function both recovered. On hospital day 11 (illness day 16), a third chest CT scan showed patchy shadows and ground-glass opacity were obviously absorbed (Figure 1C). In view of the patient\u2019s clinical manifestations and other laboratory findings, the Citrobacter freundii in 2 sputum cultures was considered as a colonized bacteria of the respiratory tract and was not being treated. Three pharyngeal swabs obtained from hospital day 10 to hospital day 13 were found to be negative for SARS-CoV-2 on RT-PCR assays. Amoxicillin potassium clavulanate was discontinued on hospital day 11, and interferon \u03b1-1b was discontinued on the following day. According to the latest interim guidance of the COVID-19 diagnosis and treatment in China, the patient met the discharge criteria. However, we found that her anal swabs collected on hospital day 11 and 13 were still positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Thus, the patient remained hospitalized. From February 16, 2020, she was transferred to another hospital for continued isolation and observation. In the process of manuscript revision, we have learned that she was still asymptomatic during this period, and the anal swab collected on February 28, 2020 was negative for this viral RNA.\nRegarding the patient\u2019s mother, we have learned that this viral RNA had been detected in the mother\u2019s stool sample on February 4, 2020 (illness day 8) and anal swab on February 7, 2020 (illness day 11), although she also had no abdominal symptoms. In addition, 3 consecutive tests of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the monther\u2019s breastmilk were negative between February 2, 2020 and February 4, 2020. The mother\u2019s urine specimen collected on February 6, 2020 was negative for SARS-CoV-2.\nDISCUSSION\nThe SARS-CoV-2 infection can lead to acute resolved or fatal pneumonia. Currently, the main source of infection is COVID-19 patients. The route of human-to-human transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is mainly through respiratory droplets and contacts. The fecal-oral route and maternal-infant transmission have not been confirmed or ruled out. Although the number of cases has increased rapidly, information on the clinical characteristics of affected pediatric patients is rare. We have learned that Middle East respiratory syndrome-coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in children is less frequent and seems to be associated with less mortality unless the patient has underlying comorbidities [1, 2]. This impression in children with MERS-CoV was also reported during the SARS-CoV infections in pediatric patients, in which symptoms were milder, there were few hospitalizations, and resulted in no death [3, 4]. Possible explanations include low exposure, presence of asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic patients, the immature immune system, and the presence of unidentified factors. The SARS-CoV-2 strains are less genetically similar to SARS-CoV (with 79% identity) and MERS-CoV (approximately 50%) [5], so regarding the infection of SARS-CoV-2 in children, there are still many gaps in our understanding, including route of transmission, susceptibility, clinical course of patients, the disease pathogenesis, pharmacological therapies, prognosis, etc.\nWei et al [6] reported 9 infants diagnosed with COVID-19, including 1 baby at the age of 1 month, 26 days. However, there was no detailed information about the patients\u2019 examination and treatment in this letter. Our report illustrated the full clinical course of the infected infant. The patient had traveled to Hubei, China and had the sick contacts during her stay in Hubei. Although signs and symptoms caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection at the prodromal phase was atypical and nonspecific, the chest CT scan showed bilateral patchy shadows, in line with the atypical pneumonia. Acute liver injury and cardiac damage were also observed in this patient. Due to the difficulty of specimen collecting and the risk of cross-infection when going out for examination, other etiological tests of cardiac and hepatic abnormalities, except for rotavirus and cytomegalovirus detection, were not performed. Given the patient\u2019s definite contact history of COVID-19, positive SARS-CoV-2 RNA, and good response to treatment, the 2 injuries were thought to be related to COVID-19. Elevated CD8+ cell count in peripheral blood and increased serum IgM level on admission might indicate that both cellular immune and humoral immune in acute infection have been activated to produce cytotoxic T lymphocyte and antibodies to kill and neutralize the virus. Huang et al [7] found that SARS-CoV-2 infection appears to be initially associated with an increased T helper 2 cell response, which might reflect a physiological reaction to suppress overt inflammatory responses.\nOur case patient initially presented with mild dry cough and no fevers. However, from day 7 of her illness, her symptoms were gradually getting worse, especially on day 9 of her illness, coinciding with results of the second chest CT scan. The timing of our patient\u2019s progression is consistent with that reported in adults [8, 9]. Due to the lack of effective verbal communication with infants, more frequent and careful clinical monitorings should be performed to find disease progression. When the patient\u2019s status was worsening, symptomatic support was strengthened. Corticosteroids were not used in this patient, because her clinical condition was not completely out of control, and there is still no conclusive evidence of net benefit in the treatment of respiratory infection due to several viruses including SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV [10, 11]. Therefore, the timely and appropriate symptomatic support treatment and the patients\u2019 own immune system may be the best means to combat the SARS-CoV-2 in pediatric patients.\nCONCLUSIONS\nWe noticed that 3 consecutive tests of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the breastmilk of the infant\u2019s monther were negative. Whether the virus could not enter the milk due to some barrier and whether a confirmed case could continue to provide her breastmilk for baby deserve further study. In addition, the SARS-CoV-2 RNAs have been detected in the stool specimens or anal swabs of both the patient and her mother, indicating a potential alternative route of fecal-oral transmission, even in patients without gastrointestinal symptoms. However, the clinical significance of this detection of viral RNA outside the respiratory tract is unknown at this stage. Fecal RNA appeared later than that of pharyngeal swab in the mother, which might indicate that the virus is swallowed into the digestive tract during the process of its elimination from the respiratory tract. Moreover, we also observed that it takes longer for a fecal SARS-CoV-2 RNA to turn negative than that of a pharyngeal specimen in the infant. This phenomenon might indicate that the digestive tracts clear the virus more slowly than the respiratory tracts. Whether the patient isolation should not be terminated until SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the stool turns negative is worth exploring. Just like the other 2 studies [9, 12], we found no evidence of viral shedding in urine of the patient\u2019s monther. However, improved systematic serial collection and testing of an increased number of urine samples is warranted to exclude this route of transmission. Finally, our understanding of COVID-19 is changing on a daily basis, and with continuous efforts from all sides, we hope and believe that this abominable disease can be controlled soon.\nNotes\nAcknowledgments.

There are few reports about asymptomatic contacts of infected patients identified as positive for SARS-CoV-2 through screening. We studied the epidemiological and clinical outcomes in 55 asymptomatic carriers who were laboratory confirmed to be positive for SARS-CoV-2 through nucleic acid testing of pharyngeal swab samples. The asymptomatic carriers seldom occurred among young people (aged 18\u201329 years) who had close contact with infected family members. In the majority of patients, the outcome was mild or ordinary 2019 novel coronavirus disease during hospitalization.\nSARS coronavirus 2, asymptomatic infection, outcome\nTopic: china infections treatment outcome hospital admission sars-cov-2\nIssue Section: Brief Report\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the focus of global attention which began with an outbreak of a febrile respiratory illness in December 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei Province [1]. It was reported that the virus was transmitted between humans [2, 3], especially among family members [4]. Prompt public health measures were taken in China, including intensive surveillance and epidemiological investigations. According to the latest recommendations [5], 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is classified into 4 types: mild, ordinary, severe, and critical. Mild and ordinary cases have good prognoses, but severe cases, and especially critical cases, always present with systematic organ dysfunction and involve prolonged hospitalization [6]. To date, no obvious breakthroughs in the treatment of severe coronavirus infection have been identified. Previous reports have indicated that the onset of symptoms may help physicians identify patients with poor prognosis and that meticulous supportive care can be effective [7].\nShenzhen City is located in the southern part of Guangdong, China, and approximately 70% of the population is migrant people. After the traditional Chinese New Year holidays, massive human movement occurred. Since the first clinical case of COVID-19 was reported on 11 January 2020, Shenzhen has become one of the main epidemic areas for this disease. Close contacts are isolated and monitored at home or at designated hotels, and more and more asymptomatic cases were found. We reviewed findings in asymptomatic cases that were laboratory confirmed to be positive for SARS-CoV-2 through nucleic acid testing of pharyngeal swab samples. We retrospectively analyzed clinical outcomes in 55 asymptomatic patients who were infected with SARS-CoV-2 and admitted to the Third People\u2019s Hospital of Shenzhen, China.\nMETHODS\nEthical Considerations\nThis study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Third People\u2019s Hospital of Shenzhen, China, on 23 February 2020. Informed consent was obtained from all of the patients or their guardians.\nClinical Classification\nCases were classified as follows: (1) mild, mild clinical symptoms without pneumonia seen at chest computed tomography; (2) ordinary, fever and other respiratory symptoms with pneumonia seen at imaging; (3) severe, respiratory distress, hypoxia (oxygen saturation, \u226493%), or abnormal results of blood gas analysis (PaO2 < 0 mm Hg or PaCO2 >50 mm Hg); and (4) critical, respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation, shock, or other organ failure requiring intensive care unit monitoring and treatment.\nData Collection\nWe obtained data from medical records, including all symptoms at onset, physical examination findings (all study subjects were asymptomatic at admission; symptoms that developed during hospitalization were recorded), laboratory and imaging data, and personal history. We included in the study asymptomatic patients who had laboratory-confirmed positive results for SARS-CoV-2 (based on nucleic acid testing of pharyngeal swab samples [8]) after the diagnosis of COVID-19 in a family member and who were admitted to the Third People\u2019s Hospital of Shenzhen from 11 January 2020 to 29 February 2020. The exclusion criteria were suspected COVID-19 with symptoms such as fever, cough, fatigue, poor appetite, diarrhea, and headache at admission.\nLaboratory data include complete blood cell count, C-reactive protein (CRP) level, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, liver and renal function, electrolyte levels, coagulation test results, and levels of procalcitonin, interleukin 6, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and creatine kinase. Pharyngeal swab samples were collected for the SARS-CoV-2 test on the day of admission.\nThe collected samples, stored at 2\u00b0C\u20138\u00b0C, were sent on ice to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention of Shenzhen. Viral RNA was extracted from pharyngeal swab samples using the QIAamp RNA Viral Kit (Qiagen), and quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction was performed using the primers and probes targeting the ORF1ab and N genes of SARS-CoV-2, as recommended by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention [9]. Virus clearance was defined as 2 consecutive negative nucleic acid test results (at a sampling interval of \u22651 day).\nAll acquired data were cross-checked by 2 investigators to ensure that there was no duplicated information. Investigators were trained to use a standardized questionnaire to collect epidemiological information immediately after patients were admitted, with face-to-face interviews with the patients or their guardians and relevant medical staff.\nStatistical Analysis\nBasic descriptive analyses were performed in all patients. IBM SPSS 18.0 statistical software was used for statistical analyses.\nRESULTS\nGeneral Characteristics of Asymptomatic Patients With Confirmed SARS-CoV-2 Infection\nA total of 55 asymptomatic case patients were identified with SARS-CoV-2 infection after the onset of illness in an infected family member. These included 22 male and 33 female patients, aged from 2 to 69 years; their median age was 49 years, and 30.9% were 30\u201349 years old (Table 1). More than half of the patients belonged to the native population of Hubei Province. Ordinary COVID-19 was the outcome in 70.9% of the asymptomatic case patients.\nTable 1.\nGeneral Characteristics of Asymptomatic Patients With Confirmed Infection\nData Patients by Infection Classification, No. (%)a\nTotal (N = 55) Mild (n = 14 [25.5%]\uff09 Ordinary (n = 39 [70.9%]\uff09 Severe (n = 2 [3.6%]\uff09\nAge, median (range), y  49 (2\u201369)  25 (3\u201363)  49 (3\u201369)  62 (62\u201364) \nAge groups, y         \n<18  15 (27.3)  5 (9.1)  10 (18.2)  0 (0.0) \n18\u201329  1 (1.8)  0 (0.0)  1 (1.8)  0 (0.0) \n30\u201349  17 (30.9)  8 (14.5)  9 (16.4)  0 (0.0) \n50\u201359  6 (10.9)  0 (0.0)  6 (10.9)  0 (0.0) \n>60  16 (29.1)  1 (1.8)  13 (23.6)  2 (3.6) \nSex         \nMale  22 (40.0)  4 (7.3)  18 (32.7)  0 (0.0) \nFemale  33 (60.0)  10 (18.2)  21 (38.2)  2 (3.6) \nNative to Hubei Province         \nYes  31 (56.4)  7 (12.7)  22 (40.0)  2 (3.6) \nNo  24 (43.6)  7 (12.7)  17 (30.9)  0 (0.0) \nUnderlying diseases         \nHypertension  8 (14.5)  0 (0.0)  6 (10.1)  2 (3.6) \nHypothyroidism  1 (1.8)  0 (0.0)  1 (1.8)  0 (0.0) \nChronic pharyngitis  1 (1.8)  0 (0.0)  1 (1.8)  0 (0.0) \nHepatitis B  1 (1.8)  0 (0.0)  1 (1.8)  0 (0.0) \nAsthma  1 (1.8)  0 (0.0)  1 (1.8)  0 (0.0) \nCholecystitis  1 (1.8)  0 (0.0)  1 (1.8)  0 (0.0) \naData represent no.

A 2-year-old boy had ordinary COVID-19 diagnosed after being testing 3 times within 2 weeks. Despite being asymptomatic, the 55 patients were admitted immediately and medically isolated. The interval between hospitalization and illness onset was 1\u20137 days. On admission, all 55 patients underwent chest computed tomography (CT), which showed pneumonia in 37. Chest CT findings were initially normal in 18 patients (32.7%); 16 experienced no symptoms during hospitalization. Two women >60 years old were admitted promptly after their infected family members and had normal chest CT findings on day 1. During the course of hospitalization, they both had mild cough and low fever 5 days later, along with hypoxia (oxygen saturation, 90%) and restlessness. Repeated CT showed pneumonia (Figure 1).\nFigure 1.\nOpen in new tabDownload slide\nRepresentative thoracic computed tomographic scans of a patient with severe illness, showing normal findings on admission day 1 (A), diffuse patchy shadowing (arrow) on day 5 (B), more diffuse patchy shadowing (arrows) on day 8 (C), and recovery stage on day 15 (D). R indicated the right lung.\nAfter informed consent was obtained, lopinavir-ritonavir therapy was initiated in all 55 patients and continued for 7 days. The 2 patients with hypoxia were also treated with intravenous immunoglobulin (10 g/d) and methylprednisolone (1\u20132 mg/kg/d) therapy for 3 days and with a heated humidified high-flow nasal cannula for 5 days. Eventually, they both recovered without complications. None of the patients were admitted to the intensive care unit.\nAll the patients recovered and were discharged to home. In all patients, results of 2 consecutive nucleic acid tests of nasopharyngeal swab samples (sampling interval, \u22651 day) were negative for SARS-CoV-2 after 4\u201321 days. Three sputum samples from patients with ordinary COVID-19 were negative 3\u20135 days after nasopharyngeal swab testing. A history of hypertension was present in 8 patients, and a history of cholecystitis. hypothyroidism, chronic pharyngitis, hepatitis B, and asthma in 1 patient each. Epstein-Barr virus was diagnosed serologically in 1 patient, and Mycoplasma pneumoniae in 3. Neutropenia and lymphocyte counts below normal occurred in 11 patients each. Initial biochemical results showed elevated CRP levels, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and LDH levels in 10, 20, and 13 patients, respectively (Table 2).\nTable 2.\nLaboratory and General Results in Asymptomatic Patients With Confirmed Infection\nResults Patients, No. (N = 55)a\nElevated WBC count (>1.5 \u00d7 109/L)  1 \nDecreased WBC count (<4.0 \u00d7 109/L)  11 \nDecreased lymphocyte count (<1.5 \u00d7 109/L)  11 \nElevated CRP level (>8 mg/L)  10 \nElevated ESR (>20 mm/h)  20 \nElevated LDH level (>250 U/L)  13 \nComplicated infection   \nEpstein-Barr virusb  1 \nMycoplasma pneumoniaeb  3 \nTime interval, median (time), d    \nFrom hospitalization to illness onsetc  5 (1\u20137) \nFrom positive to negative nucleic acid test result   10 (4\u201321) \nAbbreviations: CRP, C-reactive protein; ESR, erythrocyte sedimentation rate; LDH, lactate dehydrogenase; WBC, white blood cell.\naData represent no. of patients unless otherwise specified.\nbEpstein-Barr virus and M. pneumoniae infections were diagnosed serologically.\ncIllness onset was defined as the appearance of symptoms or abnormal computed tomographic findings.\nOpen in new tab\nDISCUSSION\nOverall, of the 55 patients admitted with asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection in this study group, 14 had mild, 39 had ordinary, and 2 had severe COVID-19 during hospitalization. Age was significantly associated with asymptomatic occurrence. Asymptomatic cases occurred seldom among young people (18\u201329 years old). This was a novel discovery but one we should interpret with caution owing to the small number of patients.\nIn the current study, we found that 3.6% of asymptomatic patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection might take a turn for the worse. Only 2 patients had typical symptoms (both cough and fever) [10], 3\u20135 days after hospital admission. Family members with fatigue and dry cough, and particularly those with fever, were easily noticed, but asymptomatic members were initially ignored. Many asymptomatic persons were actually a source of SARS-CoV-2 infection but were considered healthy before they underwent screening. The risk of viral spread from asymptomatic patients with infection suggest that prompt screening of family members of infected persons is important.\nIt is evident that family cluster transmission of SARS-CoV-2 was one main mode of transmission [11]. A previous study in Nanjing found that people (<15 years old) were prone to be asymptomatic [12]. We found that asymptomatic cases of infection occurred seldom in young people (18\u201329 years old) in Shenzhen. Nucleic acid testing would therefore be crucial to screen for asymptomatic infections in this population.\nA previous study indicated that CRP and LDH levels may be predictors of disease severity [13]. CRP levels, LDH levels, and white blood cell counts were elevated occurred in 10, 13 and 1 patient, respectively. Eleven patients (including the 2 with severe infection) had leukopenia. Here we found no relationship between clinical type and laboratory results; this should be further investigated.\nIn 3 patients, sputum samples became negative 3\u20135 days later than nasopharyngeal swab samples. To et al [14] reported that serial monitoring of saliva viral load generally showed a declining trend. We therefore recommend that monitoring viral loads in sputum samples is crucial in late-stage COVID-19, as previously recommended [15].\nHowever, the current study has several limitations. First, the data are retrospectively analyzed, so the possibility of recall bias cannot be ruled out. Second, we collected most but not all laboratory data. However, Shenzhen is an international city with adequate public health interventions and medications. The enrolled patients were identified through systematic screening of the family members of patients with COVID-19. All asymptomatic patients were admitted to the Third People\u2019s Hospital of Shenzhen, the only designated hospital in Shenzhen, so the study population is representative of the whole city.\nIn conclusion, we present here the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of patients with asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection in Shenzhen. In our study, asymptomatic infection was seldom seen in young people; the proportion with severe COVID-19 was low, and the proportion with ordinary COVID-19 was high. To better minimize the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection, preventive measures focusing on high-risk populations are recommended. A negative sputum swab test was recommended to the isolation of the infection source.\nNotes\nAcknowledgment.

We evaluated this association in a prospective birth cohort setting.\nMethods\nA total of 324 healthy infants were followed up from birth to age 3 years. Nasal swab samples were collected at age 3, 6, 12, 18, 24, and 36 months and screened for HRV and HEV using real-time reverse-transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Stool samples were collected monthly and analyzed for HRV, HEV, and HPeV. AOM episodes diagnosed by physicians were reported by parents in a diary. The association of viruses with AOM was analyzed using generalized estimation equations, and their relative contributions using population-attributable risk percentages.\nResults\nA clear association was found between AOM episodes and simultaneous detection of HEV (adjusted odds ratio for the detection of virus in stools, 2.04; 95% confidence interval, 1.06\u20133.91) and HRV (1.54; 1.04\u20132.30). HPeV showed a similar, yet nonsignificant trend (adjusted odds ratio, 1.44; 95% confidence interval, .81\u20132.56). HRV and HEV showed higher population-attributable risk percentages (25% and 20%) than HPeV (11%).\nConclusions\nHEVs and HRVs may contribute to the development of AOM in a relatively large proportion of cases.\nTopic: enterovirus otitis media, acute child infant parechovirus parent picornaviridae picornaviridae infections rhinovirus nose viruses birth stool specimen\nIssue Section: Major Article", "jiaa077": "A Familial Cluster of Infection Associated With the 2019 Novel Coronavirus Indicating Possible Person-to-Person Transmission During the Incubation Period\nPing Yu,\nJiang Zhu,\nZhengdong Zhang,\nYingjun Han\nThe Journal of Infectious Diseases, jiaa077, https://doi.org/10.1093/infdis/jiaa077\nPublished: 18 February 2020 Article historyAbstract\nAn ongoing outbreak of pneumonia associated with 2019 novel coronavirus was reported in China. It is unclear whether the virus is infective exists during the incubation period, although person-to-person transmission has been reported elsewhere. We report the epidemiological features of a familial cluster of 4 patients in Shanghai, including an 88-year-old man with limited mobility who was exposed only to asymptomatic family members whose symptoms developed later. The epidemiological evidence has shown possible transmission of 2019 novel coronavirus during the incubation period.\n2019-nCoV, family cluster, incubation period, infectivity\nTopic: infections incubation period sars-cov-2\nIssue Section: Brief Report\nIn December 2019, a series of viral pneumonia cases of an unknown cause appeared in Wuhan, Hubei, China [1]. Deep sequencing analysis from lower respiratory tract samples indicated a novel coronavirus, which was named 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). As of 12 February 2020, a total of 59 804 confirmed cases of 2019-nCoV infection have been detected in China, in 31 provinces, municipalities, and special administrative regions. Of the persons infected, 1367 have died and 5911 have recovered. Moreover, cases of 2019-nCoV are no longer limited to mainland China; at this writing, infections have been reported in 24 countries, including Singapore, the Republic of Korea, and Japan [2].\nThe first clinical data from 41 individuals with a confirmed diagnosis of 2019-nCoV infection in Wuhan, China, have been published. Of the 41 patients, 27 had direct exposure to the Wuhan seafood market, which is thought to be the initial infection site from an animal source [3]. Separately, clinical and microbiological data were reported from a family of 6, who had travelled to Wuhan and later presented with viral pneumonia at a Shenzhen Hospital in Guangdong province . Five of those 6 were identified as being infected with the 2019-nCoV, but none had been to the Wuhan market, and only 2 had visited a Wuhan hospital. These findings suggested possible person-to-person transmission of this novel coronavirus in a hospital and family setting; they followed the reports of other infected travelers in other geographic regions [4]. As the outbreak progressed, more relative studies with bigger population have been reported [5].\nThe ongoing 2019-nCoV outbreak has undoubtedly brought back memories of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)\u2013coronavirus (CoV) outbreak, which started 17 years ago [6\u20138]. With this experience in mind, to stop the spread of the disease, public health officials have to rely on placing under quarantine those who may have been exposed to 2019-nCoV, and isolating those with suspected, probable, or confirmed cases of infection, and requiring everyone to wear masks in public places.\nHowever, according to the updated version (version 4) of a new coronavirus pneumonia prevention and control program published by China\u2019s National Health Commission [9], close contacts are defined as those who have been exposed to case patients with clinical symptoms. At present, most close contacts are isolated in their homes and performing self-monitoring; the main monitoring indicators are fever or respiratory symptoms. To make the quarantine and isolation as effective as possible, it is essential to know the infectivity of 2019-nCoV during the incubation period.\nHerein, we report the epidemiological features of a family cluster involving 4 2019-nCoV cases in Shanghai. Two case patients were from Wuhan, but the other 2 had not left Shanghai recently. The evidence from our epidemiological investigation suggests that 2019-nCoV may be infectious during the incubation period.\nMETHODS\nOn 21 January 2020, 2 patients from the same family unit were taken to hospital A in Shanghai with fever, respiratory symptoms, and pulmonary infiltrates on their chest radiographs. Considering the serious outbreak in Wuhan, both cases were diagnosed as suspected 2019-nCov infection, according to the epidemiological history and clinical features. The patients were immediately isolated and reported to the local Center for Disease Control and Prevention.\nThe investigators from the local center immediately conducted a face-to-face epidemiological survey for patients 1 and 2, and they collected clinical and laboratory data, including results of hematological, radiological, and respiratory pathogen examinations. On 23 January 2020, another 2 patients from this family unit were also taken to hospital A with fever. Cases 3 and 4 were investigated by telephone. Epidemiological information had been provided by the patients. All laboratory procedures for the clinical samples have been reported elsewhere [10]. Nasopharyngeal and throat swab samples were obtained and placed into viral transport medium. Plasma was separated using ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid bottles, and serum using clotted blood bottles.\nThis investigation was undertaken in response to a public health emergency declared according to the laws of the People\u2019s Republic of China on the prevention and treatment of infectious diseases [11], and it was not carried out with formal ethical approval. All patients were informed of their rights according to the laws cited above, and we obtained verbal consent from all patients.\nRespiratory samples from the patients were tested for influenza A and B viruses using the Xpert Xpress Flu/RSV assay (GeneXpert System; Cepheid), according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions [12]. The 2019-nCoV nucleic acid test was conducted by means of real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction, using detection reagents from Zhuo Cheng Hui Sheng Biotechnology and Berger Medical Technology.\nRESULTS\nIn total, there were 4 patients in our study from 1 family unit. We numbered the cases from 1 to 4 according to the order of illness onset. The relationships and demographic information are shown in Figure 1.\nFigure 1.\nOpen in new tabDownload slide\nRelationships and demographics of the 4 case patients.\nPatient 1\nPatient 1, an 88-year-old man, was incapacitated, and had hypertension, heart disease, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. He lived in Shanghai year-round, with only his wife, patient 4. He had not left home for at least 2 weeks before illness onset, and had no contact with any other people except patients 2, 3, and 4. He had had no contact with wild animals or persons with fever or pneumonia, nor had visited a farmers market or local hospitals in Shanghai 2 weeks before illness onset.\nAt about 11 AM on 20 January, patient 1 had a poor appetite and dry cough at home, and then a fever (body temperature, 38.2\u00b0C). He was taken to hospital A by ambulance at 5 PM on 21 January (Figure 2). Because of his serious illness, he was admitted to the intensive care unit with supportive treatment, including oxygen and fluids.\nFigure 2.\nOpen in new tabDownload slide\nChronology of illness onset in the family cluster cases. Abbreviations: 2019-nCoV, 2019 novel coronavirus; Jan, January 2020.\nPreadmission examination showed a body temperature of 38.2\u00b0C and normal blood test results, with a white blood cell count of 7.16 \u00d7 109/L and an absolute lymphocyte count value of 1.19 \u00d7 109/L; the C-reactive protein level was also normal. Computed tomography showed interstitial hyperplasia with infection in both of the patient\u2019s lungs, especially the posterior segment of the upper lobe of the right lung and the posterior basal segment of the lower lobe of the left lung, chronic bronchitis, emphysema, pulmonary bullae of lingual segment of the left lung, pulmonary hypertension in both lungs, increased heart shadow, and calcification of the aorta and aortic wall. Both influenza A and B antigen tests had negative results.\nPatient 2\nPatients 2 and 3, married and living in Wuhan, visited patients 1 and 4 in Shanghai by high-speed train on 15 January. (Patient 2 was patient 4\u2019s sister.) From 1 to 19 January, about 2 weeks before illness onset, patients 2 and 3 lived as they normally did. They did not eat out, come into contact with wild animals, or visit a farmers market, such as the Huanan seafood wholesale market. They were not exposed to patients with fever or pneumonia and did not visit local hospitals in Wuhan. They were both previously healthy, without a history of long-term use of immunosuppressive drugs or immunosuppressive diseases and with a history of recent vaccinations.\nAfter arrival in Shanghai on 15 January, patients 2 and 3 stayed in the home of patients 1 and 4. None of them had any symptoms for the next 4 days. Patient 2 began to experience chills and fever around 10 PM on 20 January but did not measure her body temperature or take any drugs at that time. The next morning, 21 January, her body temperature was 37.6\u00b0C at 7 AM. She self-administered oseltamivir phosphate after lunch, but her symptoms showed no sign of improvement. In the afternoon, she also took acetaminophen and thought that her fever went down slightly. However, soon after that, she had a fever again. Patient 2 arrived at hospital A at 5 PM on 21 January, together with patient 1, and was admitted to the fever clinic observation room (Figure 2).\nPreadmission examination showed that patient 2 had a body temperature of 38.5\u00b0C and normal blood test results, with white blood cell count of 4.37 \u00d7 109/L and an absolute lymphocyte count of 0.88 \u00d7 109/L. Computed tomographic scans showed 2 ground-glass opacities on the inferior lobe of the right lung. Both influenza A and B antigen tests had negative results.\nPatients 3 and 4\nOne day after patients 1 and 2 were admitted to hospital A, patients 3 and 4 had fever successively on 23 January. They were also admitted to hospital A, and nasopharyngeal and throat swab samples were collected for nucleic acid detection of 2019-nCoV.\nEtiology Test Results\nThe Shanghai Center for Disease Control and Prevention confirmed that the nasopharyngeal and throat swab samples were 2019-nCoV positive for patients 1 and 2 on 22 January and for patients 3 and 4 on 24 January 2020, according to the 2019-nCoV nucleic acid tests.\nDISCUSSION\nIn this familial cluster of 2019-nCoV infection, 4 patients were tested and confirmed as 2019-nCoV positive, according to nucleic acid detection. Two of them had radiological changes showing viral pneumonia.\nIt is worth noting that patient 1 was an 88-year-old man with limited mobility. He had not left his apartment for at least 2 weeks before onset of his illness. Five days before that onset, patients 2 and 3 came from Wuhan, the focus of the 2019-nCov epidemic. It was confirmed that patients 2, 3, and 4 had not any symptoms for at least 2 weeks before the onset of illness in patient 1. Although the initial infection sources in patient 1 were most likely patient 2 or 3 during their incubation period, it is also possible that patient 4 was infected by patient 2 or 3 and then infected patient 1 during her incubation period. Because they lived in one bedroom. Thus, the infection source for patient 1 may have been patients 2, 3 and/or 4. The findings indicate that a person with 2019-nCoV might be infectious during the incubation period.\nZeng and colleagues [13] have reported that SARS cases are infectious only during their symptomatic period and are noninfectious during the incubation period [13]. Both SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)\u2013CoV infect intrapulmonary epithelial cells more than cells of the upper airways [14, 15]. Therefore, individuals in close contact with symptomatic patients with SARS should be isolated for medical observation. However, human airway epithelial cells were used to isolate 2019-nCoV, which was declared to be the seventh member of the family of coronaviruses that infect humans, different from both MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV [6]. The nasopharyngeal and throat swab samples from all 4 patients were 2019-nCoV positive in our study, indicating that 2019-nCoV can infect the upper respiratory tract. According to the National Health Commission\u2019s guideline for diagnosis and treatment of pneumonia caused by 2019-nCov, isolation and in vitro cultures showed that 2019-nCov can be found in human respiratory epithelial cells in about 96 hours [16]. These results support the hypothesis that 2019-nCoV is more infectious than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, as it is easily discharged through the respiratory tract.\nThe infectivity during the incubation period for 2019-nCoV is a big challenge for controlling the disease, especially with the new considerations for the possible infectious sources and the recognition and isolation of close contacts. Here are our recommendations. First, the epidemiological exposure history should be taken as the most important reference for judging the potential source of infection, and isolation and protection measures should be further strengthened for the relevant persons with clear risk factors for exposure history. Second, the determination of close contacts should also include those who are exposed to case patients during their incubation. Third, research into and development of a high-sensitivity rapid diagnostic reagent for 2019-nCoV should be accelerated, to facilitate the screening of infected persons among clinical and close contacts. Fourth, health education should be further strengthened, and protective equipment should be properly used to reduce the exposure to 2019-nCoV. Finally, if possible, the isolation and medical observation of close contacts should be centralized under the premise of the safely transport, such as masks, single-person transfer and transport vehicle disinfection, et al. It is important to establish a community supervision mechanism when home isolation and observation are needed.\nNotes\nAcknowledgments.

There is currently no approved therapeutic for human use against NiV infection. Griffithsin (GRFT) is high-mannose oligosaccharide binding lectin that has shown in vivo broad-spectrum activity against viruses including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, human immunodeficiency virus 1, hepatitis C virus, and Japanese encephalitis virus. In this study, we evaluated the in vitro antiviral activities of GRFT and its synthetic trimeric tandemer (3mG) against NiV and other viruses from across 4 virus families. The 3mG had comparatively greater potency than GRFT against NiV due to its enhanced ability to block NiV glycoprotein-induced syncytia formation. Our initial in vivo prophylactic evaluation of an oxidation-resistant GRFT (Q-GRFT) showed significant protection against lethal NiV challenge in Syrian golden hamsters. Our results warrant further development of Q-GRFT and 3mG as potential NiV therapeutics.\nantiviral, Griffithsin, hamster, Nipah, therapeutic\nTopic: oxidation glycoprotein antiviral agents giant cells cricetinae viruses nipah virus\nIssue Section: Supplement Article\nNipah virus (NiV) is a zoonotic henipavirus harbored by pteropid bats, and it is responsible for causing near-annual outbreaks of fatal human encephalitis and respiratory disease in Bangladesh and India [1]. Although several therapeutics protect against lethal NiV challenge in animals [2\u20134], none is currently approved for human use. Inhibitors of NiV entry and spread generally target protein interactions involved in receptor binding or membrane fusion processes [5\u201310], but the glycosylation of NiV glycoproteins presents another viable target for therapeutic development [11\u201313]. Griffithsin (GRFT) is a homodimeric high-mannose oligosaccharide binding lectin currently being evaluated in clinical trials as a topical microbicide against human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) [14, 15], and it has also demonstrated in vivo broad-spectrum activity against viruses including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, hepatitis C virus, and Japanese encephalitis virus [16\u201319]. In this study, we characterized the in vitro antiviral activities of GRFT and its synthetic trimeric tandemer (3mG) [20] against NiV and other viruses from across 4 virus families, and we also tested the in vivo prophylactic potential of 3mG and an oxidation-resistant form of GRFT (Q-GRFT) against lethal NiV challenge in the Syrian golden hamster model. Our results warrant further development of Q-GRFT and 3mG as potential NiV therapeutics.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nBiosafety\nAll work with infectious virus or infected animals was conducted in a biosafety level 4 (BSL-4) laboratory at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) following established BSL-4 standard operating procedures approved by the Institutional Biosafety Committee.\nCompounds and Plasmids\nGriffithsin, monomeric GRFT (mGRFT), mGRFT tandemers, and Q-GRFT were expressed and purified as described previously [20\u201323]. Codon-optimized mCherry, Malaysian NiV-F, and NiV-G coding sequences were synthesized and cloned into pCAGGS expression plasmids (GenScript). A pTM1-based plasmid encoding enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) under the control of a T7 polymerase promoter (pT7-eGFP) was a gift from Dr. Mark E. Peeples (The Research Institute at Nationwide Children's Hospital).\nCells and Viruses\nHeLa, HEK293T/17, HT-1080, Vero, Huh7, and BSRT7/5 cells [24] were cultivated as previously described [25, 26]. CHO-K1 cells were maintained in F-12K medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. All cells were incubated at 37\u00b0C in 5% CO2. Wild-type NiVs (NiV Malaysia [NiV-M], NiV Bangladesh [NiV-B]), Hendra virus (HeV), recombinant reporter NiVs (rNiV-RLuc [formerly named NiV-Luc2AM], rNiV-ZsG [formerly named NiV-GFP2AM]) [27], measles vaccine virus (rMVEZEGFP(3)) [28], mumps virus (rMuV-EGFP, Iowa 2006 strain) [29], human parainfluenza virus 3 (hPIV3-GFP, JS strain) [30], human metapneumovirus (hMPV-GFP, CAN97-83 strain) [31], Lassa virus (rLASV-ZsG) [32], and Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (rCCHFV-ZsG) [33] were propagated in Vero E6, Vero, or Huh7 cells and were quantitated by 50% tissue culture infections dose (TCID50) assay [34]. Unless stated otherwise, all infections were performed at multiplicity of infection of 0.25.\nReporter Virus and Minigenome Assays\nRecombinant reporter virus assays were performed as previously described [27, 35]. In brief, 104 cells pretreated with serial dilutions of GRFT for 1 hour were infected with the above-mentioned reporter viruses (without washing) for 24\u201372 hours and then assayed either for GFP, GFP\u2005+\u2005cells, or for Renilla luciferase activity. A nanoluciferase (NLuc)-based NiV minigenome assay was conducted as previously described [25]. A total of 104 BSRT7/5 cells [24] (per well) were transfected using LT-1 transfection reagent (Mirus Bio) with appropriate amounts of NiV support plasmids (see Supplemental Methods for details). Griffithsin was added directly to the media 4 hours posttransfection, and at 48 hours NLuc activity was measured.\nVirus Yield Reduction and Immune Fluorescence Assays\nA total of 104 cells infected with NiV-M, NiV-B, or rNiV-ZsG for 1 hour were washed and treated with GRFT or 3mG. At 24\u201348 hours postinfection (hpi), viral titers from supernatants were quantitated by TCID50 assay. Fluorescent micrographs of rNiV-ZsG-infected cells were captured using the EVOS FL Cell Imaging System (Thermo Fisher Scientific) at \u00d74 magnification. For immune fluorescence, infected cells were fixed in 10% formalin, stained using GRFT at 1 \u00b5g/mL and a monoclonal anti-NiV nucleoprotein antibody [36], followed by staining with anti-GRFT polyclonal rabbit antibody, and then detected with antirabbit Dylight488 and antimouse Dylight550 antibodies (1:1000 dilution; Bethyl Laboratories) along with 4\u2019,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) nuclear stain (1:1000 dilution). Fluorescence micrographs were taken using a Nikon Axioscope Ti inverted fluorescence microscope at \u00d74 magnification.\nNipah Virus (NiV)-F and NiV-G Glycoprotein Expression, Purification, and Detection\nHEK293T/17 cells (3 \u00d7 105) were transfected with 3 \u00b5g of NiV-F AU1, NiV-G His6\u00d7, or mCherry plasmid. At 48 hours posttransfection, cells were harvested in 250 \u00b5L radioimmunoprecipitation buffer/well (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Nipah virus-F AU1 was purified from cell lysates using an anti-AU1 affinity bead column according to the manufacturer\u2019s recommendations (BioLegend). Nipah virus-G His6\u00d7 was purified using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid affinity resin. Cell lysates and purified proteins were run on SDS-PAGE gels (Supplemental Figure 1A), transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, and probed with either anti-AU1 (Bethyl) or anti-6His6\u00d7 (Cell Signaling Technology) rabbit antibodies, or with GRFT along with anti-GRFT polyclonal rabbit sera, and detected using goat antirabbit 680RD secondary antibodies (LI-COR) (Supplemental Figure 1B and C). Protein bands were visualized using LI-COR imaging.\nEnzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay Against Purified Nipah Virus (NiV)-F and NiV-G Glycoproteins\nGriffithsin binding enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) were performed as previously described [15]. In brief, 1 picomole (or 50 ng) of purified NiV-F AU1 or NiV-G His6\u00d7 was bound to a 96-well plate, which was washed and blocked with bovine serum albumin. Between requisite washing steps, plates were incubated with increasing amounts of GRFT or 3mG, followed by incubation with a 1:1000 dilution of the anti-GRFT rabbit polyclonal antibody preparation. The bound GRFT was determined using goat antirabbit antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (HRP) and a TMB peroxidase substrate system. Peroxidase activity was quenched using 1 M hydrochloric acid and absorbance was measured at 450 nm. Additional details are found in the Supplemental Methods.\nPseudotyped Vesicular Stomatitis Virus Entry Assay\nA replication-deficient vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) expressing eGFP in place of the VSV attachment glycoprotein (VSV-\u0394G-eGFP) was pseudotyped with either VSV G (VSVpt) or NiV-F and NiV-G glycoproteins (NiVpt) as previously described [37]. Fifty particles of VSVpt or NiVpt were used to either infect Vero cells in conjunction with GRFT/3mG treatment for 24 hours or to infect Vero cells that were pretreated with GRFT/3mG for 1 hours and then removed before infection. At 24 hpi, numbers of eGFP expressing cells were visualized and counted [37].\nCytopathic Effect Inhibition Assays\nInhibition of virus-induced cytopathic effect (CPE) was assayed as previously described using CellTiter-Glo 2.0 reagent (Promega) in a BioTek HD1 Synergy plate reader [25]. Luminescence values were normalized to uninfected cell controls according to % viability as follows: % viability = [(specific value-reference value)/(dimethyl sulfoxide control value \u2212 reference value)] \u00d7 100. Reference values were derived from control wells without cells. Uninfected cell control viability values (after subtraction of reference values) were set at 100% inhibition of CPE.\nQualitative and Quantitative Fusion Assays\nA total of 104 HT-1080 cells were transfected for 4 hours with 0.1 \u00b5g each of NiV-F AU1 and NiV-G HA expression plasmids, washed, and replenished with growth media containing GRFT or 3mG. At 24 hours posttransfection, cells were stained using CellMask Green (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and DAPI and viewed using a Nikon Axioscope Ti inverted fluorescence microscope at \u00d74 magnification. For quantitative fusion assay, 2 \u00d7 104 CHO-K1 cells were transfected for 4 hours with 0.1 \u00b5g each of NiV-F AU1, NiV-G HA, and pT7-eEGFP plasmids. Negative control CHO-K1 cells were transfected with 0.2 \u00b5g of NiV-F AU1 and 0.1 \u00b5g of pT7-eGFP. Cells then were washed and replenished with growth media containing GRFT or 3mG. BSRT7/5 cells (2 \u00d7 104 ) were then overlaid onto CHO-K1 cells. At ~16 hours postoverlay, green fluorescent NiV glycoprotein-induced syncytia were visualized at \u00d72.5 magnification on a Cytation5 instrument (BioTek) and counted from photograph montages of each well using Gen5 Software. Fluorescent objects that were both >75 \u00b5m in diameter and had a fluorescence reading >5000 were classified as positive syncytia. Additional details are found in the Supplemental Methods.\nEthics Statement and Animals\nAll animal experiments were approved by the CDC Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and performed in an AAALAC-International approved facility. Groups of 5\u201310 female HsdHan:AURA golden Syrian hamsters (6 weeks of age; Envigo no. 8903F) were inoculated intranasally (IN) with Dulbecco\u2019s modified Eagle\u2019s medium or NiV-B (107 TCID50). On 1 and 2 days postinfection (dpi) and/or -1 and -2 dpi, animals were treated IN with vehicle control (phosphate-buffered saline [PBS]), GRFT (10 mg/kg), or 3mG (10 mg/kg). Hamsters were humanely euthanized with isoflurane vapor when they met euthanasia criteria or at the completion of the study (28 dpi). Additional clinical scoring details are found in the Supplementary Methods.\nQuantitative Reverse-Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction\nRibonucleic acid (RNA) was extracted from blood and homogenized tissue samples using the MagMAX-96 Total RNA Isolation Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific) on a 96-well ABI MagMAX extraction platform with a DNaseI treatment step according to manufacturer\u2019s instructions. The RNA was quantitated using one-step real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) targeting the N gene sequence [38] and was standardized to 18S ribosomal RNA with a SuperScript III Platinum One-Step qRT-PCR Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific) according to manufacturer\u2019s instructions.\nPlasma Antibody Analysis\nTotal NiV-specific immunoglobulin G (IgG) and neutralizing antibodies were measured as previously described [2]. Gamma-irradiated plasma were serially diluted 1:100, 1:400, 1:1600, and 1:6400 and incubated for 1 hour on plates coated with inactivated NiV lysate or Vero cell control lysate at 37\u00b0C. With requisite washing steps, plates were then incubated with antibody detector protein A/G conjugated with HRP (Thermo Fisher Scientific) for 1 hour at 37\u00b0C, followed by incubation with ABTS substrate (KPL) for one-half hour at 37\u00b0C. Absorbance was read at 410 nm and 490 nm. Well-specific 490 nm absorbance values were subtracted from their corresponding 410 nm values. The resulting values from Vero control lysates were then subtracted from those taken from NiV-infected lysates. Cutoff values were derived from adding the mean of 6 negative control plasma to 3 times the standard deviation of the mean. Samples were considered true IgG positives if their values were above cutoff values for both 1:100 and 1:400 dilutions. Additional details are found in the Supplementary Methods. Two-fold dilutions of plasma were incubated with 200 TCID50 of NiV-B in duplicate for 1 hour and then transferred onto Vero cells for 6 days at 37\u00b0C. Neutralizing titers were recorded as the lowest reciprocal dilution at which all wells lacked CPE.\nStatistical Analyses\nAll statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism 8.1.2. Animal survival was analyzed by log-rank (Mantel-Cox) and Gehan-Breslow-Wilcoxon test. Quantitative fusion assay and virus yield comparisons between GRFT and 3mG were analyzed using multiple t tests with adjusted P values. Fifty percent effective concentrations and 50% cytotoxic concentrations were calculated using 4-parameter variable slope nonlinear regression fitting of mean values of all antiviral assays.\nRESULTS\nGriffithsin Inhibits Nipah Virus Reporter Gene Expression and Infectious Virus Production, but Not Viral Ribonucleic Acid Transcription or Replication\nWe initially tested GRFT against a reporter NiV expressing Renilla luciferase (rNiV-RLuc) [27]. Pretreatment of 4 different cell lines with increasing amounts of GRFT 1 hour before rNiV-RLuc infection resulted in dose-dependent decreases in reporter activity assayed at 24 hpi, with 50% effective inhibitory concentration (EC50) values ranging between 0.5 and 1.5 \u00b5g/mL (~20\u201360 nM) (Figure 1A, Table 1). We then measured wild-type recombinant NiV (rNiV) infectious virus yield at 24 hpi from cells treated with GRFT immediately after infection and observed a dose-dependent decrease >2 log10 TCID50 (Figure 1B). To determine whether GRFT interferes with NiV replication directly at the level of RNA transcription and replication, we tested increasing concentrations of GRFT against a reporter NiV minigenome expressing NLuc and observed no inhibition of reporter signal, consistent with no direct inhibition of viral RNA levels (Figure 1C).\nTable 1.\nSummary of GRFT and 3mG In Vitro Antiviral Activity\nVirus Family Virus ID Genotype/Strain Assay Type EC50 (nM)\nGRFT 3mG\nParamyxoviridae  NiV  M (Malaysia)  VTR  42.8  ND \n      CPE  81.3 \u00b1 26.7  29.4 \n  NiV  B (Bangladesh)  VTR  116.5  30.6 \n      CPE  20.9 \u00b1 0.37  10.4 \u00b1 0.14 \n  NiV  M-rNiV-RLuc  REP  49.6 \u00b1 19.9  8.4 \u00b1 2.0 \n  NiV  M-rNiV-ZsG  VTR  138.4  32.1 \n  HeV  1996  CPE  49.3 \u00b1 12.4  16.8 \u00b1 2.9 \n  MV  rMVEZGFP(3)  REP  NI  NI \n  MuV  rMuV-GFP (IA-2006)  REP  0.33 \u00b1 0.033  3.7 \u00b1 0.23 \n  hPIV3  JS-GFP  REP  271.7 \u00b1 8.0  18.5 \u00b1 0.25 \nPneumoviridae  hMPV  CAN97-83-GFP  REP  NI  NI \nArenaviridae  LASV  Josiah-ZsG  REP  NI  NI \nBunyaviridae  CCHFV  Ibar10200-ZsG  REP  NI  72.9 \u00b1 48.7 \nAbbreviations: CCHFV, Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus; CPE, cytopathic effect; EC50, 50% effective concentration; GRFT, griffithsin; HeV, Hendra virus; hMPV, human metapneumovirus; hPIV3, human parainfluenza virus 3; ID, identification; LASV, Lassa virus; MuV, mumps virus; MV, measles vaccine virus; ND, not done; NI, no inhibition; NiV, Nipah virus; REP, reporter assay; VTR, virus titer reduction; 3mG, synthetic trimeric tandemer.\nOpen in new tab\nFigure 1.\nOpen in new tabDownload slide\nGriffithsin (GRFT) inhibits Nipah virus (NiV) replication but does not inhibit NiV minigenome ribonucleic acid transcription and replication. (A) Griffithsin inhibits reporter NiV expressing Renilla luciferase (rNiV-RLuc) in human embryonic kidney (HEK-293T), fibrosarcoma (HT-1080), cervical carcinoma (HeLa), and African green monkey kidney cell lines (Vero). Cells were pretreated with 3-fold serial dilutions of GRFT for 1 hour before being infected with rNiV-RLuc at multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.25. At 24 hours postinfection (hpi), Renilla luciferase activity was measured and normalized to untreated cells infected with rNiV-RLuc. Fifty percent effective inhibition concentrations (EC50) of GRFT (in \u00b5g/mL) are indicated alongside their respective converted molar concentrations. (B) Griffithsin reduces NiV infectious yield. HT-1080 cells were infected with recombinant wild-type NiV (Malaysian strain, NiV-M) at an MOI of 0.25 for 1 hour. After removal of NiV inoculum, cells were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline and replenished with growth media. At 24 hpi, cell supernatants were harvested and subjected to 10-fold serial dilutions to inoculate Vero cells to assess virus yield by 50% tissue culture infectious dose (TCID50) assay. (C) Griffithsin does not inhibit NiV minigenome activity. BSRT7/5 cells were transfected for 4 hours with plasmids encoding the NiV nucleoprotein (NiV N), phosphoprotein (NiV P), polymerase (NiV L), and the NiV nanoluciferase (NLuc) expressing minigenome. After 4 hours, transfection mixtures were removed from cells and replenished with growth media containing 3-fold dilutions of GRFT. At 48 hours posttransfection, NLuc activity was measured and normalized to untreated cells. Dose-response experiments against rNiV-RLuc were performed in quadruplicate for each concentration in at least 2 independent experiments for each cell line except for HEK-293T. Infectious yield experiment was performed once in quadruplicate for each concentration of GRFT. Minigenome experiment was performed once in triplicate for each concentration of GRFT.\nGriffithsin Blocks Nipah Virus Entry and Spread via Interactions With Viral and Cellular Glycoproteins\nBecause GRFT preferably binds to high mannose N-linked oligosaccharides found commonly on viral envelope glycoproteins [39, 40], we sought to characterize the interaction of GRFT with purified NiV-M fusion (NiV-F AU1) and attachment (NiV-G His6\u00d7) surface glycoproteins (Supplemental Figure S1A\u2013C). We used GRFT to probe against NiV-F AU1 and NiV-G His6\u00d7 by Western blot, and we observed detection of both proteins (Figure 2A, left panel, well no. 6 NiV-F AU1, well no. 10 NiV-G). To further characterize these interactions, we performed ELISA binding assays by titrating increasing levels of GRFT against the purified glycoproteins, and we observed comparatively greater binding to NiV-G than to NiV-F (Figure 2A, right panel). We then conducted time-of-addition experiments to determine how long after infection could GRFT still inhibit virus replication. We either incubated serial dilutions of GRFT with rNiV-RLuc for 2 hours before infection or added GRFT at 0, 2, 6, or 12 hpi. Although a 2-hour preincubation of GRFT with rNiV-RLuc showed negligible differences in inhibition compared with GRFT treatment at 0 hpi, gradually increasing reporter activity correlated with longer delays before GRFT treatment (Figure 2B, left panel). It is notable, however, that even when GRFT was added 12 hpi, at concentrations of \u2265~40 nM GRFT reporter activity was still reduced compared with untreated control infected cells. Dose-response curves for reporter activity indicated an approximately 5- to 6-fold decrease in potency between 0 and 12 hpi treatments, with GRFT treatments at 2 or 6 hpi showing an intermediate 2- to 3-fold comparative decrease to 0 hpi treatment (Figure 2B, right panel).\nFigure 2.\nOpen in new tabDownload slide\nGriffithsin (GRFT) inhibits Nipah virus (NiV) entry and spread by its interaction with both NiV Malaysia (NiV-M) and cellular glycoproteins.

(Right panel) Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Data are representative of 3 experiments in triplicate. (B) Time of addition reporter rNiV-RLuc assay. (Left panel) RNiV-RLuc activity measured from infected HT-1080 cells treated with various concentrations of GRFT at indicated times on x-axis. (Right panel) Dose-response curves of rNiV-RLuc activity plotted against GRFT concentration. Effective inhibition concentrations (EC50) for rNiV-RLuc activity for GRFT treatment at 0 and 12 hours postinfection are indicated. (C) Increasing levels of rNiV-RLuc infection can partially overcome GRFT inhibition at suboptimal concentrations. HT-1080 (left panel) and Vero (right panel) cells were pretreated with GRFT for 1 hour and then infected with increasing levels of rNiV-RLuc. Renilla luciferase activity was normalized to activity measured in untreated infected cells. (D) Griffithsin inhibits rNiV spread in HT-1080 cells. Immune fluorescence assay. Cells were infected with wild-type rNiV for 1 hour before treatment with GRFT. Cells were fixed in 10% formalin and stained with anti-NiV nucleoprotein (NiV N) mouse monoclonal and anti-GRFT rabbit polyclonal antibodies, and, respectively, detected with Dylight550 (red stain; top panels) and Dylight488 (green stain; bottom panels) secondary detection antibodies, with cell nuclei being stained with 4\u2019,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI). White bars indicate 500 microns in length. Reporter rNiV-RLuc assays were performed once in triplicate.\nTo determine whether GRFT inhibition of NiV could be overcome by more virus, we used increasing amounts of rNiV-RLuc to infect GRFT-pretreated cells. We observed a dose-dependent increase in reporter activity against ~40 nM of GRFT in 2 cell types, but at higher concentrations of GRFT (~120\u2013360 nM), there were only minimal increases in reporter signal (Figure 2C, left and right panels). This indicated that higher concentrations of GRFT may better inhibit NiV entry and spread indirectly via binding to cellular glycoproteins.\nTo visualize GRFT-mediated inhibition of NiV spread, we performed immune fluorescence assay of cells infected with rNiV before treatment with GRFT. In untreated infected cells, we observed large holes in the cell monolayer caused by NiV-induced syncytia, with widespread NiV nucleoprotein antigen present (Figure 2D, top leftmost panel). With increasing amounts of GRFT, we observed smaller syncytia concomitant with a visible decrease in infected cells (Figure 2D, top 3 right panels). Cells treated with GRFT were positively stained with an anti-GRFT polyclonal antibody, indicating GRFT binding to cell-surface glycoproteins (Figure 2D, bottom 3 right panels).\nTrimeric Griffithsin Tandemer Has Enhanced Potency Against Nipah Virus\nThe presence of more than 1 oligosaccharide-binding face in the dimeric form of GRFT is crucial to maintain its potent anti-HIV-1 activity [41, 42]. Several synthetically linked tandemers of mGRFT have shown up to 10-fold greater in vitro potency than GRFT [20]. We compared the antiviral activities of GRFT to mGRFT, to a synthetic dimer (2mG), a synthetic trimer (3mG), and a Q-GRFT containing 1 amino acid change (M78\u2192Q), and we found that 3mG was most potent, Q-GRFT was equivalently potent, 2mG was less potent, and that mGRFT had lost all antiviral activity against rNiV-RLuc (Figure 3A, left and right panels, Table 1). To confirm these findings, we tested GRFT, 2mG, 3mG, and Q-GRFT against wild-type NiV-B, NiV-M, and HeV, and we observed similar trends as seen for rNiV-RLuc, with 3mG having the greatest antiviral potency (Figure 3B, Table 1). Among these compounds, only 3mG showed mild cytotoxicity at higher concentrations. We also observed varied antiviral potencies for GRFT and 3mG against other respiratory and hemorrhagic fever viruses of human public health importance, ranging from no activity to potent activity with sub-nanomolar EC50 values (Table 1, Supplementary Figures S2A\u2013D and S3A and B).\nFigure 3.\nOpen in new tabDownload slide\nSynthetic monomeric tandemers of griffithsin (GRFT) show variable activities to bind purified Nipah virus (NiV) glycoproteins and to block against Henipavirus cytopathic effect (CPE) and entry. (A) (Left panel) Trimeric monomer of GRFT (3mG) blocks reporter rNiV-RLuc activity more efficiently than GRFT and a synthetic dimeric monomer of GRFT (2mG). (Right panel) Inhibition of rNiV-RLuc is ablated against the monomeric GRFT. (B) The 3mG shows enhanced ability to block CPEs from NiV Bangladesh (NiV-B), NiV Malaysia (NiV-M), and Hendra virus (HeV) infection over GRFT, oxidation-resistant (Q-GRFT), and 2mG. Vero cells pretreated with either GRFT, 2mG, 3mG, or Q-GRFT were either infected with NiV-B (top left panel), HeV (top right panel), or NiV-M (bottom left panel) (multiplicity of infection = 0.25) or mock infected (bottom right panel) for 72 hours and were assayed for cell viability using CellTiterGlo 2.0 reagent as a measure of CPE inhibition. Levels of CPE were normalized to cell viability of uninfected cells. (C) Binding enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The 3mG shows comparatively less binding as GRFT to purified NiV glycoproteins. Half-log serial dilutions of GRFT (red circles) and 3mG (blue triangles) were incubated with immobilized purified Malaysian NiV-F AU1 glycoprotein (left panel) or NiV-G His6\u00d7 attachment glycoprotein (right panel) and detected by an anti-GRFT rabbit polyclonal antibody and an antirabbit horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibody. Absorbance levels at 450 nm indicate levels of binding as plotted against increasing concentrations of GRFT or 3mG on the x-axis. (D) Griffithsin and 3mG equivalently block NiV-F- and NiV-G-pseudotyped vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) replication-deficient particles expressing enhanced green fluorescent protein (GFP). Vero cells were treated with 3-fold serial dilutions of GRFT or 3mG for 24 hours (left panel) concurrently with infection or pretreated for 1 hour (right panel) before infection with replication-deficient VSV particles pseudotyped either with VSV-G glycoprotein (VSVpt) or the NiV-F and NiV-G glycoproteins (NiVpt). At 24 hours postinfection, numbers of GFP-positive infected cells were counted and normalized to numbers from untreated infected cells. Reporter rNiV-RLuc assays were performed once in triplicate, CPE assays were performed at least twice in triplicate, ELISAs were performed at least twice in triplicate, and pseudotyped experiments were performed twice in duplicate at each respective concentration of GRFT and 3mG.\nTo understand the greater in vitro activity of 3mG compared with GRFT, we performed ELISA protein binding assays against purified NiV-M F and G glycoproteins. We observed greater binding by GRFT to both glycoproteins than by 3mG, which was contrary to their virus inhibition profiles (Figure 3C). We then compared the abilities of GRFT and 3mG to block virus entry by replication-deficient, eGFP-expressing VSVs pseudotyped with either the VSV G glycoprotein (VSVpt) or with both NiV-M F and G glycoproteins (NiVpt). We did not observe significant differences in antiviral potencies at equivalent compound concentrations under both continuous GRFT/3mG treatment or with only 1 hour of pretreatment before infection (Figure 3D, left and right panels, respectively).\n3mG More Efficiently Reduces Syncytia Formation and Infectious Yield\nWe tested the abilities of GRFT and 3mG to block NiV-F and NiV-G glycoprotein-induced syncytia formation by treating transfected cells expressing both NiV-F and NiV-G glycoproteins with either compound, and we observed that 3mG visibly inhibited syncytia formation more efficiently than GRFT at equivalent concentrations (Figure 4A). To confirm this result, we developed a quantitative image-based syncytia counting assay. Whereas cells transfected only with NiV-F plasmid had minimal background syncytia counts, cells transfected with both NiV glycoproteins had >1000 syncytia counts (Figure 4B, left panel). Using this assay, we observed a dose-dependent decrease in syncytia counts that correlated with increased levels of GRFT or 3mG, but we noted that 3mG more efficiently reduced syncytia than GRFT at higher concentrations (Figure 4B, right panel). When Vero cells were treated with GRFT or 3mG after infection by either green fluorescent reporter NiV (rNiV-ZsG) or NiV-B, 3mG reduced virus yield more efficiently than GRFT, similarly reflecting their differing abilities to block syncytia formation (Figure 4C, left and right panels, respectively). Accordingly, 3mG visibly delayed or reduced the size of syncytia formation more efficiently than GRFT in rNiV-ZsG infected cells (Figure 4D).\nFigure 4.\nOpen in new tabDownload slide\nThe superior ability of trimeric monomer of griffithsin ([GRFT] 3mG) over GRFT to block Nipah virus (NiV) glycoprotein-mediated syncytia formation is mirrored by its enhanced reduction of NiV infectious yield.

Numbers of green fluorescent protein (GFP)-positive NiV glycoprotein- induced syncytia are plotted against increasing concentrations of either GRFT (black circles) or 3mG (red squares) (right panel).

Vero cells were infected with either reporter NiV expressing ZsGreen protein (rNiV-ZsG) (left panel) or NiV Bangladesh (NiV-B) (right panel) (multiplicity of infection = 0.25) for 1 hour before being treated with 2-fold serial dilutions of GRFT (black circles) or 3mG (red squares). At 48 hours postinfection, infectious yield was measured using 50% tissue culture infectious dose (TCID50) assay and was plotted against respective compound concentrations.

Groups of 10 animals each received intranasal doses of either Q-GRFT (10 mg/kg), 3mG (10 mg/kg) on days 1 and 2 before challenge (for 2\u00d7 dose and 4\u00d7 dose treatment groups), and on days 1 and 2 postchallenge (for 4\u00d7 dose treatment groups only). Vehicle control animals received an intranasal equivalent dose volume of PBS on the same 4 treatment days as the 4\u00d7 dose treatment groups. Animals receiving either 2 or 4 doses of Q-GRFT treatment groups showed partial but significant protection from NiV-B challenge (~35% survival rate across Q-GRFT treatment groups) (Figure 5A, top panel), whereas only 3 animals across 3mG treatment groups survived infection (~15% overall survival rate) (Figure 5A, bottom panel). More than 70% of Q-GRFT treated survivors had no clinical signs by the end of the study, whereas only one 3mG treated survivor lacked clinical signs (Supplemental Figure S4C). Nipah virus RNA was detected in most tissues sampled from euthanized or dead animals (Figure 5B, filled shapes in all 3 panels), but it was only detected in the eyes and brains of Q-GRFT and 3mG treated survivors (Figure 5B, open triangles and squares in top 2 panels). All survivors from Q-GRFT and 3mG treatment groups developed neutralizing antibody titers against NiV (Figure 5C, Supplemental Table).\nFigure 5.\nOpen in new tabDownload slide\nProphylactic intranasal administration of oxidation-resistant griffithsin (Q-GRFT) provides significant protection from lethal intranasal Nipah virus Bangladesh (NiV-B) challenge.

Two hundred 50% tissue culture infectious dose (TCID50) of NiV-B was incubated in duplicate with 2-fold dilutions of animal sera for 1 hour before being overlaid onto Vero cells for 6 days.

Geometric means are indicated by horizontal lines bisecting the error bars.\nDiscussion\nIn this study, we characterized the in vitro antiviral activity of GRFT and its 3mG tandemer against NiV and a series of other important human viral pathogens. Similar to in vitro observations for HIV-1, GRFT and 3mG can block both NiV entry and cell-to-cell spread [15, 20]. Although 3mG consistently outperformed GRFT in its ability to block both NiV glycoprotein-induced cell-to-cell fusion and NiV infectious yield, it had comparatively weaker ELISA binding profiles against purified NiV glycoproteins. This observation could be explained by differences in anti-GRFT polyclonal antibody binding to 3mG because it is not an obligate dimer as is wild-type GRFT, against which the polyclonal antibodies were generated. Future biochemical and structural studies should not only identify the N-glycosylation sites on NiV-F and NiV-G that are important for antiviral susceptibility to GRFT/3mG, but also investigate the molecular interactions of GRFT/3mG with NiV-F and NiV-G proteins to determine how these may alter the biophysical properties of a NiV virion. Despite the superior in vitro ability of 3mG to block NiV syncytia formation and virus yield, 3mG protected less than half as many animals as did Q-GRFT from in vivo challenge. This can be attributed to 3mG likely having a shorter in vivo half-life compared with Q-GRFT, which is significantly more resistant to oxidation compared with wild-type GRFT [21]. The 3mG may require re-engineering to achieve better in vivo efficacy, because 3mG contains flexible linkers that are more susceptible to proteolytic cleavage than GRFT [44]. Although all survivors developed significant neutralizing antibodies against NiV, only 1 survivor treated with 3mG tested positive for total anti-NiV IgG (Supplemental Table), suggesting that the majority of NiV-specific antibodies generated in Q-GRFT/3mG-treated survivors target the surface glycoproteins. The GRFT and other lectins represent another avenue towards developing NiV therapeutics. Because NiV glycoprotein glycosylation modulates syncytia formation and shields against neutralizing antibodies [45, 46], retaining these glycosylation sites likely maintains viral fitness. A potential treatment regimen combining GRFT with both monoclonal antibody m102.4 and nucleotide prodrug remdesivir would provide an additional constraint against development of NiV escape mutants.\nConclusions\nOur findings, taken together with the favorable pharmacokinetic and safety profiles of GRFT [22, 47\u201349], make Q-GRFT an excellent candidate for further preclinical evaluation against NiV infection.\nSupplementary Data\nSupplementary materials are available at The Journal of Infectious Diseases online.

However, differences in severity between these pathogens have been noted, suggesting the degree of illness may vary in different populations. Moreover, a potential association between hMPV and asthma also suggests that hMPV may preferentially affect asthmatic subjects.\nMethods\nIn a population-based surveillance study in children aged <2 years admitted for severe LRTI in Argentina, nasopharyngeal aspirates were tested by RT-PCR for hMPV, RSV, influenza A, and human rhinovirus.\nResults\nOf 3947 children, 383 (10%) were infected with hMPV. The hospitalization rate for hMPV LRTI was 2.26 per 1000 children (95% confidence interval [CI], 2.04\u20132.49). Thirty-nine (10.2%) patients infected with hMPV experienced life-threatening disease (LTD; 0.23 per 1000 children; 95% CI, .16\u2013.31/1000), and 2 died (mortality rate 0.024 per 1000; 95% CI, .003\u2013.086). In hMPV-infected children birth to an asthmatic mother was an increased risk for LTD (odds ratio, 4.72; 95% CI, 1.39\u201316.01). We observed a specific interaction between maternal asthma and hMPV infection affecting risk for LTD.\nConclusions\nMaternal asthma increases the risk for LTD in children <2 years old hospitalized for severe hMPV LRTI.\nhuman metapneumovirus, burden of illness, children, lower respiratory tract infection, risk factors, maternal asthma\nTopic: asthma child mothers infections lower respiratory tract infections metapneumovirus, human\nIssue Section: Major Article\nLower respiratory tract illness (LRTI) due to respiratory viruses is the leading cause of hospitalization in infants and young children worldwide [1, 2]. Human metapneumovirus (hMPV) is a frequent pediatric pathogen, associated with 5%\u201325% of all cases of LRTI [3\u20136]. As with other pathogens, its burden is higher in developing countries and low-income populations [7\u20139].\nThe clinical presentation and virulence of hMPV LRTI in infants and young children resembles that of other viruses, including respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), being also capable of eliciting life-threatening disease (LTD) [10, 11]. That is why, in the context of the changing landscape of new interventions against RSV, it is important to understand how hMPV disease behaves in children and identify novel, preventable risk factors for severe disease.\nPreviously known risk factors for poor clinical evolution in children hospitalized for hMPV LRTI, such as prematurity, congenital heart disease, immunodeficiency, and neuromuscular disease, are not hMPV specific [3, 12\u201315]. Considering that the pattern of T-helper 2 (Th2) cytokines observed in respiratory secretions during hMPV LRTI may sometimes resemble that of individuals with asthma (including eosinophilic inflammation, higher interleukin-4 [IL-4] and IL-5 levels in mouse models [16], and induction of thymic stromal lymphopoietin in human airway cells [17, 18]) we speculated that a history of asthmatic predisposition could specifically modify severity of hMPV disease in children.\nMETHODS\nStudy Design\nWe conducted a prospective, multicenter active surveillance study to characterize the burden of severe LRTI in children from a low-income region in Buenos Aires, Argentina from 2011 to 2013. Details of the population are provided elsewhere [19]. The study was held in 12 public hospitals, from a geographically defined low-income region in the Buenos Aires suburbs, that provide care to an estimated population of 56\u2005560 children younger than 2 years who lacked medical insurance [20]. Previous studies in this population examined RSV LRTI severity and the role of cytokines in human rhinovirus (hRV) infections [19, 21\u201325]. The study was approved by institutional review boards at each participating hospital, the state of Buenos Aires, and Vanderbilt University. All participating families signed an informed consent to join the study.\nEligibility criteria included infants and children younger than 2 years admitted for severe LRTI, defined as the sudden onset of cough, wheezing, retractions and/or crackles, with or without fever, and an oxygen saturation <93% when breathing room air or the need for O2 support on arrival to emergency rooms. LTD was defined as O2 saturation \u226487% on admission, requirement for mechanical ventilation, and/or admission to the intensive care unit.\nDemographic and Clinical Information\nInformation on demographic, epidemiological, and clinical status was recorded from all participating patients from the time of admission until discharge using specifically designed questionnaires. In the study, we evaluated risk factors for hospitalization including prematurity (<37 weeks\u2019 gestation at birth), age, sex, lack of breastfeeding, malnutrition, house and floor materials, smoking at home, sources of heating, crowding (defined as more than 3 persons/room), parent\u2019s education, and availability of sewage system. Maternal asthma was defined as a physician diagnosis of asthma in the mother before infant enrollment.\nLaboratory Tests\nNasopharyngeal aspirates were collected at the time of admission in patients from consenting families. Samples were tested in duplicate by real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for hMPV. Samples were also tested for influenza A viruses, RSV, and hRV, as previously described [19].\nStatistical Analysis\nRates of severe and life-threatening hMPV disease were calculated by dividing the number of patients hospitalized with hMPV severe respiratory infection by the estimated census annual population in the selected area [20]. Student t test and \u03c72 were used to compare children\u2019s clinical and epidemiological characteristics when appropriate. For the evaluation of risk factors associated with hMPV LTD, we used a multivariable logistic regression model. Covariates selected a priori and with a P value\u2005<\u2005.1 in univariate analysis were included in the model and analyzed in a stepwise forward logistic regression. A P value of less than .05 was considered statistically significant. Statistical analyses were performed using the Stata package for IBM-PC (Stata Corp).\nRESULTS\nBurden of Human Metapneumovirus LRTI\nA total of 4045 hospitalized infants and young children met inclusion criteria; 3947 (98%) agreed to participate in the study. Clinical manifestations on admission were similar for participating and nonparticipating children (not shown). hMPV was detected in 383 (10%) children. Of these, 75 (20% of hMPV infections) were coinfected with RSV, 64 (17%) with hRV, and 1 with influenza A. Six patients were simultaneously infected with hMPV, RSV, and hRV. hMPV cases were more frequent during the first year of the study and always followed the same seasonal pattern as RSV with a distinct midwinter peak (Figure 1). In each year, RSV was the virus most frequently detected in study participants.\nFigure 1.\nOpen in new tabDownload slide\nViral circulation in infants and children 0\u201324 months of age during the study period.

B, Number of hospitalized patients with hMPV LRTI according to the epidemiological week during the 3 respiratory seasons (2011, solid line; 2012, dashed line; 2013, dotted line).\nAmong the 383 hMPV-infected children, 84% were younger than 1 year with a mean age on admission of 7.4 months (SD, 5.08); 56% were boys. The rate of hospitalization for hMPV LRTI was 3.8 per 1000 infants (95% CI, 3.4\u20134.2) and 2.26 per 1000 children younger than 2 years (95% CI, 2.04\u20132.49). Among all hMPV-infected patients, 39 (10.2%) experienced LTD (0.23 per 1000 children; 95% CI, .16\u2013.31/1000). The mean age for LTD was 6.0 months (SD, 3.9; P\u2005=\u2005.08 vs ward admissions) (Figure 2). Two boys died at 3 and 9 months of age due to hMPV, for a case-fatality ratio of 0.52% (95% CI, .06\u20131.87) and an infant hMPV mortality rate of 0.024 per 1000 (95% CI, .003\u2013.086). Both children had no previously known comorbidities and died due to septic shock and respiratory failure, respectively. Compared to other viral etiologies, even when no virus was isolated, hMPV-associated case-fatality ratio appeared to be lower (RSV, 0.9% [95% CI, .44\u20131.35)]; hRV, 0.86% [95% CI, .17\u20132.5]; influenza A, 0.96% ([95% CI, .02\u20135.2]; and no virus detected, 0.68% [95% CI, .27\u20131.39]).\nFigure 2.\nOpen in new tabDownload slide\nDistribution of life-threatening disease (LTD) in patients with human metapneumovirus (hMPV) severe lower respiratory tract illness according to age.

However, coinfections did not increase the risk of LTD (Table 1). In comparison to patients with RSV LRTI, hMPV-infected hospitalized patients were significantly older (OR, 1.05; 95% CI, 1.02\u20131.07), breastfed less frequently (OR, 0.67; 95% CI, .46\u2013.97), and were at lower risk of experiencing LTD (OR, 0.56; 95% CI, .36\u2013.86) (Table 1).\nTable 1.\nEpidemiological and Clinical Differences Between Human Metapneumovirus Single Infection, Human Metapneumovirus Coinfections, and Respiratory Syncytial Virus Single Infection\nVariable hMPV Single Infection (n\u2005=\u2005235) RSV Single Infection (n\u2005=\u20052204) P Valuea hMPV Coinfections (n\u2005=\u2005148) P Valueb\nInfant variables           \nAge, mo, mean (SD)  7.7 (5.04)  6.3 (5.21)  .0001  6.9 (5.13)  .119 \nMale  122 (55.36)  1209 (68.97)  .378  90 (62.5)  .054 \nPrematurityc  34 (14.47)  272 (12.34)  .350  15 (10.14)  .219 \nLow birth weightd  36 (15.32)  269 (12.21)  .171  22 (14.86)  .904 \nBreastfeeding  199 (84.68)  1967 (89.25)  .036  125 (84.46)  .953 \nComorbiditiese  12 (5.11)  86 (3.9)  .373  5 (3.38)  .427 \nComplete immunization schedulef  124 (57.14)  1257 (59.29)  .427  79 (56.83)  .722 \nAssistance to day care  8 (3.56)  96 (4.47)  .523  6 (4.2)  .755 \nMalnutritiong  2 (1.96)  25 (3.77)  .365  2 (3.13)  .637 \nAtopyh  9 (4.02)  97 (4.55)  .79  3 (2.14)  .296 \nFamilial variables           \nSiblings with asthma  33 (19.19)  299 (19.14)  .628  27 (26.47)  .144 \nPaternal asthma  11 (4.93)  108 (5.3)  .924  6 (4.29)  .364 \nMaternal asthma  12 (5.38)  118 (5.51)  .279  6 (4.26)  .91 \nCurrent maternal smoking  61 (27.6)  561 (26.56)  .818  34 (24.29)  .698 \nCurrent paternal smoking  48 (41.38)  637 (45.18)  .672  28 (38.36)  .866 \nPregnancy variables           \nIntrauterine growth retardation  12 (5.53)  87 (4.15)  .696  11 (7.91)  .761 \nTeenage mother  22 (9.36)  206 (9.35)  .994  7 (4.73)  .101 \nElderly mother  23 (9.79)  257 (11.66)  .392  16 (10.81)  .747 \nSmoking during pregnancy  46 (20.44)  450 (20.82)  .792  24 (17.02)  .408 \nSocioeconomic variables           \nCrowding  125 (53.19)  1041 (47.23)  .083  78 (52.7)  .926 \nPrecarious homei  165 (70.21)  1528 (69.33)  .780  100 (67.57)  .585 \nLow maternal educationj  28 (11.91)  295 (13.38)  .528  19 (12.84)  .789 \nClinical features at admission           \nTachypnea  57 (24.26)  572 (25.95)  .572  54 (36.49)  .011 \nTachycardia  53 (22.55)  520 (23.59)  .721  51 (34.46)  .011 \nWheezing  46 (19.57)  549 (24.91)  .543  43 (29.05)  .033 \nChest retractions  52 (22.13)  469 (21.28)  .347  50 (33.78)  .012 \nClinical outcomes during admission           \nPneumonia  21 (8.93)  146 (6.62)  .184  7 (4.73)  .13 \nPneumothorax  1 (.43)  17 (.77)  .562  \u2026  \u2026 \nSepsis  5 (2.13)  30 (1.36)  .352  1 (.68)  .291 \nLife-threatening diseasek  25 (11.11)  370 (18.26)  .008  14 (10.14)  .773 \nData are No. (%) except where indicated.

Indeed, hMPV LRTI was milder in our population than disease elicited by RSV, hRV, and/or influenza A (OR,\u20050.53; 95% CI, .36\u2013.79) (Figure 3). But even though disease associated with hMPV was generally milder, a subgroup of infected children still experienced LTD. We therefore investigated whether a subpopulation with identifiable risk factors was disproportionality represented in this subgroup of subjects.\nFigure 3.\nOpen in new tabDownload slide\nMultivariable analysis of risk for life-threatening disease (LTD) according to infecting virus. Odds ratio with 95% confidence interval for LTD (O2 saturation \u2264 87% on admission, requirement for mechanical ventilation, and/or admission to the intensive care unit) in infants and children 0\u201324 months of age hospitalized for human metapneumovirus single virus or coinfection (hMPV), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), human rhinovirus (hRV), influenza A single infections, and with no virus detected (no virus) lower respiratory tract illness.\nGiven the Th2 polarization in respiratory secretions [16\u201318] and the reported association between hMPV hospitalizations and asthmatic children [12, 26, 27], we hypothesized that children of asthmatic mothers would be overrepresented among patients infected with the virus experiencing LTD. Indeed, the rate of hMPV LTD in children of asthmatic mothers was 277/1000 compared to children of nonasthmatic mothers whose hMPV LTD rate was 3.4 times lower at 82.3/1000 (OR, 4.29; 95% CI, 1.42\u201312.93; P\u2005=\u2005.01 for LTD in children of asthmatic mothers vs children born to nonasthmatic mothers). The observed effect for maternal asthma remained significant after adjusting for important confounders (detailed in Table 2; OR, 4.72; 95% CI, 1.39\u201316.01). Conversely, no increased risk was observed for maternal asthma in promoting LTD during RSV (OR, 1.4; 95% CI, .85\u20132.33), hRV (OR, 0.36; 95% CI, .07\u20132.93), or influenza A infections (OR, 1.33; 95% CI, .1\u201316.91) (Figure 4). Interestingly, when compared with patients with no virus detected as the control group, we observed that children admitted with hMPV infection and whose mothers were not asthmatic had a lowest risk of experiencing LTD (OR, 0.51; 95% CI, .33\u2013.78; interaction P value\u2005=\u2005.024). However, when the mother was asthmatic, hMPV infection did not significantly increase the risk of having LTD compared to those without viral detections (Supplementary Table 1).\nTable 2.\nMultivariable Analysis of Risk Factors for Life-threatening Disease in Children Hospitalized With Human Metapneumovirus Infection\nRisk Factors Multivariable Analysis\nOR (95% CI) P Value\nSewage  0.4 (.14\u20131.1)  .076 \nRunning water  0.7 (.29\u20131.72)  .439 \nAge <6 mo on admission  2.22 (.93\u20135.27)  .071 \nComorbiditiesa  6.47 (1.55\u201327.00)  .01 \nBreastfeeding  0.61 (.21\u20131.77)  .360 \nSmoking during pregnancy  2.04 (.81\u20135.14)  .129 \nMaternal asthma  4.72 (1.39\u201316.01)  .013 \nSevere complicationsb  4.69 (1.65\u201313.37)  .004 \nAbbreviations: CI, confidence interval; OR, odds ratio.\naComorbidities: severe neurologic disorder, congenital cardiopathy, hematologic disorder, or immunodeficiency.\nbSevere complications: pneumonia, sepsis, pneumothorax, or apnea.\nOpen in new tab\nFigure 4.\nOpen in new tabDownload slide\nMultivariable analysis of risk for life-threatening disease (LTD) according to infecting virus and maternal asthma status.

In the subgroup of children with hMPV infections in the absence of RSV (hMPV single infections and coinfections with hRV or influenza A), maternal asthma promoted LTD (OR, 3.8; 95% CI, 1.12\u201312.88; P\u2005=\u2005.03). The impact of maternal asthma in RSV infections alone was, conversely, not significant.\nDiscussion\nOur study reveals 2 interesting features of hMPV LRTI. While the virus appears to elicit milder disease among hospitalized children than other agents, among children admitted with hMPV LRTI, those born to asthmatic mothers are at increased risk for LTD. Twenty-eight percent of hMPV-infected patients hospitalized with LRTI and born to asthmatic mothers experienced LTD, in comparison to only 8% hMPV-infected patients hospitalized and born to nonasthmatic mothers. If confirmed in other studies and populations, these observations would be of considerable public health importance, given that asthma is the most frequent chronic disease during pregnancy with rising prevalence, and is now between 10% and 12% [28, 29].\nWhether the observed phenomenon is due to direct effects from the immune response or other dysregulations due to maternal asthma during pregnancy [30\u201332], or represents an early warning in young future asthmatics, needs further investigation. The immune response against hMPV is complex [4]. The virus has been reported to trigger Th2 cytokines through thymic stromal lymphopoietin, IL-4, IL-5, IL-13, and Th-17 responses via the release of IL-1\u03b2, IL-17, and IL-6 [17, 18, 33\u201335]. Interestingly, asthma and pregnancy itself also elicit a Th2 [28, 36, 37] and Th17 [38\u201340] bias. In studies analyzing other health metrics, maternal asthma has been previously associated with poor maternal (gestational diabetes and placenta previa), perinatal (preterm birth, low birth weight, and preeclampsia), and neonatal (severe hRV LRTI, neonatal death, and hospitalizations) outcomes [28, 29].\nAs reported by other groups, our study also showed that patients admitted for hMPV LRTI with previous comorbidities and those with severe complications during hospitalization were at higher risk for LTD. These risk factors have been described before for hMPV and other respiratory viruses [3, 12\u201315].\nSeveral reports describe coinfections between hMPV and other respiratory viruses, mainly with hRV and RSV [41]. As others and our results suggest, hMPV may play an important role in these coinfections [42\u201344]. Perhaps this phenomenon is explained in part by \u201cviral interference,\u201d when one virus totally or partially blocks the replication of the other pathogen [45]. However, the role for hMPV as a coinfecting agent is still unclear and requires further study [46\u201348]. In a changing epidemiological landscape driven by preventive interventions against RSV, hMPV may soon alter its role and overall importance as a childhood pathogen should viral replacement occur [49]. Targeting children of asthmatic mothers for prophylaxis against hMPV may be a cost-effective strategy in the era of personalized medicine.\nIn addition, our study provides important disease burden information about hMPV. The hMPV infant hospitalization rate was surprisingly similar in our population to that in the United States, which is estimated at 2\u20134.9 per 1000 infants [5, 26], and is considerably lower than that of RSV in other countries [23]. Importantly, the hMPV case fatality ratio in hospital was almost half that reported for RSV in the same population, highlighting that, to date, RSV remains the most important target for prevention [23].\nOur study has limitations. First, because (as is the case for most studies) we did not analyze our samples for all other viruses, such as coronavirus or parainfluenza virus type 3, their effect on our observations is unknown. Second, given the age of our subjects and the prospective nature of this program, whether severity depended causally on maternal disease versus infant atopy/asthma cannot be answered. Third, given the observational nature of our study design focused on generating new hypotheses, no adjustment for multiple testing was performed. Additional research is needed to confirm the role of maternal asthma as a risk factor for severity in hMPV-infected children. However, our program also has significant strengths, including its prospective design and the evaluation of respiratory samples using state-of-the-art laboratory RT-PCR techniques. Furthermore, to our knowledge, this is the first population-based study seeking to define the burden of hMPV disease in a vulnerable population from a low- or middle-income country. In addition, this large study addressed numerous prenatal and perinatal risk factors, examining how they modify the severity of infection.\nIn summary, we report a novel observation that may alter our thinking about severe hMPV infections and, if confirmed in other studies, require us to reformulate its prevention strategies. hMPV represents a threat for life-threatening disease to young children born to asthmatic mothers.\nSupplementary Data\nSupplementary materials are available at The Journal of Infectious Diseases online.

Nipah virus is capable of infecting a broad range of hosts including humans, pigs, ferrets, dogs, cats, hamsters, and at least 2 genera of bats. Little is known about the biology of NiV in the bat reservoir. In this study, we evaluate the potential for the Egyptian fruit bat (EFB), Rousettus aegyptiacus, to serve as a model organism for studying NiV in bats. Our data suggest that NiV does not efficiently replicate in EFBs in vivo. Furthermore, we show a lack of seroconversion against NiV glycoprotein and a lack of viral replication in primary and immortalized EFB-derived cell lines. Our data show that despite using a conserved target for viral entry, NiV replication is limited in some bat species. We conclude that EFBs are not an appropriate organism to model NiV infection or transmission in bats.\nbats, Egyptian fruit bats, experimental infection, Nipah virus\nTopic: cell lines chiroptera fruit nipah virus\nIssue Section: Supplement Article\nNipah virus (NiV) is a zoonotic pathogen that can cause acute respiratory illness and fatal encephalitis upon spillover into human populations. Since its discovery in Malaysia in 1998, NiV has emerged as a persistent public health problem in southeast Asia warranting inclusion on the World Health Organization Blueprint list of priority diseases for which research toward effective countermeasures is urgently needed [1]. Unlike other paramyxoviruses, NiV has a broad host tropism with multiple taxa supporting viral replication including ferrets, hamsters, cats, dogs, African Green monkeys, squirrel monkeys, and pigs [2\u20135]. Nipah virus uses 2 major envelope glycoproteins to enter the host cell: the receptor-binding protein (G) and the fusion protein (F) [6]. After attachment of the NiV G to the host cell receptor, ephrin-B2 or ephrin-B3, NiV F fusogenic activity is triggered leading to the merger of the virion and host cell membranes and subsequent virus infection [7\u201311]. Ephrins are highly conserved across mammalian taxa given their key role in development of the central nervous system [12], likely contributing to the unusually broad host range of NiV.\nFruit bats in the genus Pteropus have been identified as the primary reservoir hosts for NiV [13]. Spillover of NiV from bats to humans is thought to occur through ingestion of food or liquids contaminated with infected bat urine [14]. Pteropus spp bats are known to feed from the spigots of date palm sap collection jars, often urinating into and contaminating the collection jars before human consumption [14, 15]. Although Pteropus spp bats are implicated as the primary reservoir for NiV, they comprise only a fraction of the fruit bat visitation to date palm sap collection jars in Bangladesh [15]. Several other fruit bat species overlap with the distribution of Pteropus spp bats and visit date palm sap collection jars, suggesting that if other bats are potential secondary reservoirs for the virus, then they may contribute to Nipah virus spillover.\nLess is known about the infection and enzootic transmission dynamics of NiV in reservoir populations or between coroosting bat species. Nipah virus has been isolated from the urine of both wild caught [16\u201318] and experimentally challenged [19] Pteropus spp bats. Nipah virus ribonucleic acid (RNA) has also been detected in an insectivorous bat, Hipposideros larvatus [20], and serological evidence of NiV infection has been detected in several other species of frugivorous and insectivorous bats, including Rousettus leschenaultia [21, 22].\nDespite efforts to understand enzootic transmission dynamics, many questions remain regarding the biology of NiV infection in bats. Studies of wild caught Pteropus spp suggest potential for viral recrudescence [16, 23]; however, the hypothesis that NiV may persist in an individual bat and re-emerge under times of stress has yet to be confirmed experimentally.\nPteropus spp bats are suboptimal model organisms for studying NiV due to size and availability. In contrast, the Egyptian fruit bat (EFB), Rousettus aegyptiacus, belongs to the same taxonomic family as Pteropus spp, Pteropodidae, and has been successfully used to model Marburg virus transmission [24, 25] and serological cross-reactivity after filovirus challenge [26]. Egyptian fruit bats are common in zoological settings because they are small, amenable to handling, and reproduce readily in captivity. The EFB transcriptome is well annotated [27], and there have been recent efforts to analyze the genome in context of antiviral immunity [28]. In this study, we evaluate EFBs as a model system for NiV infection in bats.\nMETHODS\nEthics Statement\nAll work with NiV was conducted in the biosafety level (BSL) 4 facility at the Rocky Mountain Laboratories, Division of Intramural Research, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health following standard operating procedures as approved by the Institutional Biosafety Committee. Egyptian fruit bats were sourced from a US-based zoological facility. All animal experiments were approved by the Rocky Mountain Laboratories Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (ASP no. 2018-042E) and performed following the guidelines of the Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care, International (AAALAC) by certified staff in an AAALAC-approved facility.\nVirus Preparation\nNipah virus was obtained through the Special Pathogens Branch of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (Atlanta, GA). Nipah virus Bangladesh was isolated from a throat swab from a human patient in 2004 (GenBank accession number AY988601); the virus was propagated on Vero-E6 cells and passaged a total of 2 times. The virus stock was deep sequenced at the Rocky Mountain Laboratories Genomics Core Unit before the start of this study to confirm that no fungal or bacterial contaminants were present.\nIn Vitro Replication Kinetics on Bat Cell Lines\nPrimary EFB cell lines were generated as previously described [29], with modifications, from kidney (RAKSM) and lung (RALU) tissue samples obtained from an EFB euthanized under BSL2 conditions. In brief, tissue homogenates were washed in phosphate-buffered saline and resuspended in primary cell culture (D12) media containing Dulbecco\u2019s modified Eagle\u2019s medium (DMEM)/F-12 supplemented with nonessential amino acids, 12% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 1 mM L-glutamine, 50 U/mL penicillin, 50 \u03bcg/mL streptomycin, 1 \u03bcg/mL amphotericin, and 1 mM sodium pyruvate. After 1 passage, amphotericin was excluded from the D12 media. Cells were not maintained after 3 passages.\nImmortalized bat cell lines including EFB kidney cells (RoNi), Hypsignathus monstrosus kidney cells ([HypNi] provided by Marcel A. M\u00fcller at the Berlin Institute of Health, Germany), and EFB fibroblast cells ([RE06] provided by Ingo Jordan at ProBioGen AG, Berlin, Germany) were obtained and grown in D12 media without amphotericin. Vero-E6 cells were used as a positive control. Each cell line was seeded in triplicate in 12-well plates and inoculated with NiV at a multiplicity of infection of 0.1 in DMEM supplemented with 2% FBS, 1 mmol/L L-glutamine, 50 U/mL penicillin, and 50 \u03bcg/mL streptomycin. Supernatants were collected at 0, 24, 48, and 72 hours postinoculation and stored in AVL buffer (QIAGEN) at \u221280\u00b0C until inactivation and RNA extraction. After inactivation of the virus with AVL and ethanol as described in [30], RNA extraction was performed on the QIAcube (QIAGEN) with the Machery-Nagel Nucleospin Virus Core kit (Machery-Nagel). We then performed quantitative real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRTPCR) as described in [31] on the QuantStudio 5 Real-Time PCR System (Thermo Fisher Scientific) with the inclusion of a serially diluted known concentration of NiV on each plate to calculate tissue culture infectious dose (TCID50/mL) equivalent for each sample.\nEphrin-B2 and Ephrin-B3 Amino Acid Sequence Alignments\nSequences for the NiV receptors, ephrin-B2 and ephrin-B3, that have been experimentally demonstrated to support NiV entry [32] were downloaded from National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) in addition to the EFB ephrin-B2 and ephrin-B3 sequences. The sequences for each ephrin were translated before alignment using the MAFFT v7.388 [33] plugin implemented in Geneious Prime 2019.0.4 (Biomatters Ltd).\nInoculation of Egyptian Fruit Bats and Sample Collection\nNipah virus was diluted in sterile DMEM, and 105 TCID50/mL was administered to each of 12 adult R aegyptiacus bats via the intraperitoneal route of inoculation in a final volume of 200 \u03bcL. Oronasal, urogenital, and rectal swabs were collected daily in addition to swabbing the excreta pan of each cage for the first 14 days followed by twice-weekly sampling through 28 days postinoculation (DPI). Temperature and weight for each bat was taken at the time of sampling. Blood was drawn before inoculation, then at 7 DPI, 14 DPI, and 21 DPI for survivors in addition to terminal blood draws at 3 DPI, 7 DPI, and 28 DPI for serological analyses. Tissue samples were taken at necropsy and either stored at \u221280\u00b0C until RNA extraction or placed in 10% formalin for histopathology and immunohistochemistry analysis. The RNA extraction and qRTPCR were conducted as described in [31] and performed on a QuantStudio 5 Real-Time PCR System (Thermo Fisher Scientific).\nSerological Analysis\nSera were analyzed for presence of immunoglobulins (Ig) specific to the NiV-G using a Luminex xMAP-based multiplex bead assay adapted from [34]. In brief, blood was collected into serum-separating tubes before centrifugation at 1000 \u00d7g for 10 minutes; serum was then collected and frozen at \u221280\u00b0C. Each sample received a dose of 8 MRads irradiation while on dry ice before heat-inactivation at 56\u00b0C for 30 minutes. Soluble NiV-G (NiV-sG) was produced in a FreeStyle 293-F stable cell-line expression system before purification as described [35] and coupling to Bio-Plex Pro magnetic COOH beads (Bio-Rad). We diluted each serum sample 1:250, and each serum sample was run in duplicate with the Bio-Plex 200 system (Bio-Rad) with purified rabbit IgG against NiV-sG diluted to 1:1000 as the positive control.\nRESULTS\nIn vitro replication kinetics showed no appreciable increase in NiV titer over a 72-hour period on the 4 EFB cell lines tested including the 2 primary EFB cell lines and the 2 immortal EFB cell lines (Figure 1). The hammer-headed fruit bat cell line supported moderate NiV replication relative to the Vero-E6 cell line (Figure 1). An alignment of the NiV host receptors, ephrin-B2 and ephrin-B3, show no unique amino acid changes in the critical G protein-binding (G-H) loop between the EFB sequences and the sequences of species that have been confirmed to facilitate NiV entry (Figure 2).\nFigure 1.\nOpen in new tabDownload slide\nReplication kinetics of Nipah virus (NiV) in Egyptian fruit bat (EFB) primary kidney (RAKSM) and lung (RALU) cell lines, EFB immortalized kidney (RoNi) and fibroblast (RE06) cell lines, and Hypsignathus monstrosus bat (HypNi) cell lines relative to African green monkey kidney cell lines (Vero-E6).

Species and accession numbers are listed to the left of each (A) amino acid alignment for ephrin-B2 with the GH loop highlighted in gray and (B) amino acid alignment for ephrin-B3.\nThe EFBs showed no significant change in temperature or weight throughout the study period, although variability was high for both metrics (Figure 3A and B). We did not detect NiV RNA in any of the tissue samples or swab samples tested by qRTPCR, with no samples amplifying within 40 thermal cycles (Table 1, Supplementary Table 1). None of the bats seroconverted against NiV G during the study period with a cutoff threshold of 3 times the naive mean fluorescence intensity; however, 1 bat showed a slight increase in mean fluorescence intensity relative to the naive bat serum at 21 and 28 DPI (Figure 4). We confirmed that the inoculum contained 105 TCID50/mL through back-titrations of the diluted viral stock (data not shown). None of the sectioned tissue samples showed pathology associated with NiV infection, and no NiV antigen was detected via immunohistochemistry staining (Figure 5).\nTable 1.\nTissues Samples Tested for Presence of NiV RNA by qRTPCR With Cq Value Listed Followed by Number of Individual Bats Sampled in Parentheses\nSample D3 D7 D28\nLung  >40 (4)  >40 (4)  >40 (4) \nKidney  >40 (4)  >40 (4)  >40 (4) \nBladder  >40 (4)  >40 (4)  >40 (4) \nBrain (frontal)  >40 (4)  >40 (4)  >40 (4) \nBrain (cerebellum)  >40 (4)  >40 (4)  >40 (4) \nBrainstem  >40 (4)  >40 (4)  >40 (4) \nNasal turbinates  >40 (4)  >40 (4)  >40 (4) \nNeutralizing antibody titer  0 (4)  0 (4)  0 (4) \nAbbreviations: Cq, quantitation cycle; D, day; NiV, Nipah virus; qRTPCR, quantitative real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction; RNA, ribonucleic acid.\nOpen in new tab\nFigure 3.\nOpen in new tabDownload slide\nChange in bat weight and body temperature after inoculation with Nipah virus (NiV).

The lack of detectable viral RNA in both the swabs and the tissues across all time points suggests that the bats did not shed virus nor was viral replication detected in any of the tested tissue types (Table 1); viral replication and shedding are qualities associated with natural hosts [36, 37]. Back-titrations of the viral inoculum confirmed that the EFBs received a 105 TCID50 dose NiV, which is higher than the 5 \u00d7 104 TCID50 NiV challenge that resulted in productive viral replication in guinea pigs and Pteropus bats [19]. A lack of detectable virus in any EFB tissue samples 3 days postinoculation suggests that the virus was rapidly cleared; Halpin et al [13] report that henipavirus inoculum is cleared within 48 hours. The bats did not seroconvert against NiV G in the given timeframe of 28 days, although 1 individual had a slight increase in mean fluorescence intensity at 21 and 28 DPI, which may have increased above our cutoff if given more time (Figure 4). Previous studies have demonstrated that EFB cells are permissive to Ebola virus, but experimentally challenged bats did not shed virus or support productive replication [38, 39] despite compatibility between the Ebola virus glycoprotein and the host receptor, NPC1 [40]. These data suggest that productive viral replication is blocked by a mechanism other than compatibility with the host receptor. Likewise, van Doremalen et al [41] reported a lack of efficient viral replication in EFBs when challenged with bat severe acute respiratory syndrome-like coronavirus WIV1 despite in vitro receptor compatibility. Given the lack of unique variation in either EFB ephrin-B2 or ephrin-B3 relative to compatible host ephrin sequences (Figure 2), it is likely that NiV virus replication is not inhibited by a lack of binding between NiV G and the EFB ephrin-B2 or ephrin-B3, nor the subsequent F-mediated activation and membrane fusion process. Indeed, NiV F and G can mediate productive cell-cell fusion in a variety of different mammalian species including several that are negative or refractory to productive infection, such as rabbit and mouse [32, 42].\nBecause we did not detect viral replication or shedding, we conclude that EFBs are not a suitable model system for modeling NiV transmission dynamics in bats. However, follow-up studies to determine the mechanism of inhibition of viral replication in EFBs would be valuable in elucidating the evolution of NiV in its natural reservoirs. Few controlled studies have been conducted using bats as a model organism, and, as such, there are few reagents commercially available for studying the immunobiology of bats in response to viral infection. Further research is urgently needed to expand upon the current capacity to conduct research in bats, particularly when considering that 5 of 9 viruses associated with the World Health Organization\u2019s Blueprint list of priority diseases [1] likely originated as bat-borne zoonoses.\nCONCLUSIONS\nRecent studies have applied machine learning algorithms to prioritize surveillance for high-impact pathogens such as NiV and Ebola virus using data on ecological traits, life history, demographic traits, and species distributions [43, 44]. Although it is important to consider broader ecological characteristics in determining potential for a host species to contribute to virus spillover and maintenance, understanding the limitations to reservoir potential on a mechanistic level for high-impact pathogens such as NiV would further improve predictive modeling work. Testing viral entry and replication through in vitro assays are important first steps in determining host potential, but this should be followed by in vivo experiments when possible.\nSupplementary Data\nSupplementary materials are available at The Journal of Infectious Diseases online.

Producing rhinovirus (RV) inocula from nasal secretions has required prolonged observation of the virus donor to exclude extraneous pathogens. We produced a RV-A16 inoculum using reverse genetics and determined the dose necessary to cause moderate colds in seronegative volunteers.\nMethods\nThe consensus sequence of RV-A16 from a previous inoculum was cloned, and inoculum virus was produced using reverse genetics techniques. After safety testing, volunteers were inoculated with either RV-A16 (n = 26) or placebo (n = 10), Jackson cold scores were recorded, and nasal secretions were tested for shedding of RV-A16 ribonucleic acid.\nResults\nThe reverse genetics process produced infectious virus that was neutralized by specific antisera and had a mutation rate similar to conventional virus growth techniques. The 1000 median tissue culture infectious dose (TCID50) dose produced moderate colds in most individuals with effects similar to that of a previously tested conventional RV-A16 inoculum.\nConclusions\nReverse genetics techniques produced a RV-A16 inoculum that can cause clinical colds in seronegative volunteers, and they also serve as a stable source of virus for laboratory use. The recombinant production procedures eliminate the need to derive seed virus from nasal secretions, thus precluding introduction of extraneous pathogens through this route.\ncommon cold, inoculation, reverse genetics, rhinovirus\nTopic: common cold bodily secretions rhinovirus safety vaccination genetics nose viruses pathogenic organism\nIssue Section: Viruses\n(See the Editor Commentary by Proud on pages 181\u20133)\nRhinoviruses (RV) are the most frequent cause of the common cold, and they can also cause lower respiratory illnesses in susceptible populations including young children, the elderly, immunocompromised individuals, and people with chronic respiratory conditions such as asthma, chronic obstructive lung disease, or cystic fibrosis [1]. Although the morbidity associated with these respiratory illnesses is considerable, specific treatments are lacking.\nThe RV experimental inoculation model has been used to (1) investigate mechanisms of RV pathogenesis and transmission, (2) test the efficacy of treatments for the common cold, and (3) understand how RV infections contribute to acute exacerbation of chronic airway diseases such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) [2\u201311]. Recent advancement in safety test technologies led to the introduction of new standards of current Good Manufacturing Procedures (GMP) for production of viral inocula [12]. The traditional method of producing a virus inoculum for use in experimental infection is to isolate a \u201cseed virus\u201d from nasal secretions of a donor who had been infected via natural exposure. This approach is labor intensive in that the donor needs to be checked for any other infectious agents and then observed for 1 year to ensure there are no other coinfections [13].\nIn this report, we describe the development of a reverse genetics (RG) approach to produce an inoculum of a major group clinical isolate (RV-A16). This approach has 2 advantages compared to traditional procedures. First, several \u201cnew\u201d respiratory viruses (eg, Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus, WU and KI polyomaviruses [14, 15]) have been discovered in the past decade, and additional infectious agents will likely be discovered in the future. Therefore, it is difficult to ensure that nasal secretions that are chosen for isolation of seed virus do not contain any other pathogens. This problem is minimized through the use of a cloned viral genome to produce the inoculum virus in vitro. A second potential advantage is the ability to produce multiple inocula from the same cloned sequence. Ribonucleic acid (RNA) viruses, such as RV, have high mutation rates during genome replication because their RNA polymerases have no error-correcting function. A complementary deoxyribonucleic acid (cDNA) clone, which is amplified by the highly accurate Escherichia coli DNA polymerase, provides a stable source of virus sequence for production of future inocula. This paper describes the development of (1) an RG-RV-A16 inoculum and (2) a first-in-human, phase 1 study to assess the safety of RG-RV-A16 in humans and identify the dose needed to produce moderate-to-severe colds in 75% of RV-A16-seronegative human volunteers.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nMaster Cell Bank\nPassage 1 human lung fibroblasts for viral culture ([HLF-VC1] University of Wisconsin-Madison) thawed in November 2003 were used to produce a Master Cell Bank at the Waisman Clinical Biomanufacturing Facility (Madison, WI) under GMP conditions. Extensive testing for identity, quality, and safety revealed no evidence of microbial or viral contamination (Supplemental Data and Supplemental Table 1).\nSafety Testing\nSafety testing of the inoculum as directed by the US Food and Drug Administration and regulatory agencies [12, 16, 17] was negative for contaminants and adventitious agents (Supplemental Table 2).\nClinical Trial\nThis study was approved by the University of Wisconsin-Madison Health Sciences Institutional Review Board (protocol 2012-1036-CP002). All study participants and household contacts provided written informed consent. Regulatory approvals are listed in Supplemental Table 3. Animal experiments were conducted after approval by the IIT Research Institute (Chicago, IL; IACUC Protocol 2324-2011). The data supporting this publication are available at ImmPort (immport.org) under study accession SDY1300.\nStudy Design\nThe inoculation study had a single-blind, 5 + 5 adaptive dosing design with dose escalation or de-escalation with a maximum of 4 dosing groups of up to 10 adult subjects. Inclusion criteria included otherwise healthy adults between 18 and 50 years of age who had no neutralizing antibody to the inoculum virus. Exclusion criteria included chronic respiratory disease, smoking, and subjects with household contacts deemed at-risk (eg, pregnancy, elderly, young children). Detailed inclusion and exclusion criteria are listed in Supplemental Table 4.\nSubjects were inoculated on day 0 with either placebo (phosphate-buffered saline with 0.1% human serum albumin) or 100, 500, 1000, or 10000 median tissue culture infectious dose (TCID50) of RG-RV-A16 (Supplemental Table 5). The inoculum was administered as an aerosol (MAD Nasal Intranasal Mucosal Atomization Device; Teleflex, Morrisville, NC), and 100 \u03bcL was administered via each nostril. The initial dose of the RV-A16 was 100 TCID50; 5 subjects were inoculated at a given dose level, and the dose for the next group of 5 subjects was determined based on clinical symptoms of the previous 5 subjects and the dose received by the previous 5 subjects (details in Supplemental Figure 1 and Supplemental Table 4). The study was designed such that a maximum of 10 subjects would receive any of the dosing levels (placebo, 100, 500, 1000, or 10000 TCID50).\nSymptom Assessments\nSymptom scores (modified Jackson Cold Symptom Scores; Supplemental Figure 2) were assessed twice daily for each subject beginning on the day of inoculation and continuing for at least 7\u201310 days or until the symptoms resolved, and then again on the final visit. The Daily Symptom Score represents the sum of the highest score (the AM or the PM score) obtained for each of 13 symptoms. The Peak Symptom Score for each subject represents the highest of the Daily Symptom Scores for the 7-day evaluation period. The severity of the induced cold for each study participant was defined by the Peak Symptom Score and was categorized as either mild (score <7), moderate (score 7\u201311), or severe (score \u226512). The Mean Cold Symptom Score for each dosing group is the average of the Peak Symptom Scores.\nNasal Lavage and Viral Diagnostics\nNasal lavage was performed for cell counts and diagnostic virology (details in online Supplement). Preinoculation nasal lavage was assayed by multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (RVP; Luminex, Austin TX) to detect any virus present at the time of inoculation. Nasal lavage fluid, collected after RG-RV-A16 inoculation, was tested by RV-specific quantitative reverse transcription (RT)-PCR and partial genomic sequencing to confirm infection with RG-RV-A16 and to determine viral load [18]. Viral shedding was determined by quantitative PCR (qPCR) and reported in log RNA copies/mL [19]. Serum obtained 7\u201310 days after inoculation was also tested by RV qPCR to assess for viremia.\nStudy Outcomes\nThe 2 primary endpoints for the study were (1) to identify the dose of RG-RV-A16 that caused colds of at least moderate intensity (peak symptom score >7) during the first week (or longer at the discretion of the principal investigator in case of a delayed peak in symptoms) after inoculation and (2) safety as determined by adverse event reporting. Secondary endpoints were (1) the Mean Cold Symptom Score per RG-RV-A16 dose, (2) Infection rate per RG-RV-A16 dose (percentage of individuals in the dosing group with detectable RV-A16 RNA in nasal secretions), and (3) Mean Cold Symptom Scores for each RG-RV-A16 dose versus placebo.\nSafety Assessments\nSafety laboratory tests, to include complete blood count with differential and platelets, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, and immunoglobulin (Ig)A and IgG serum Igs, were drawn at screening to determine eligibility and 21\u201328 days after inoculation to monitor for any inoculum-induced laboratory changes.\nHousehold Contacts\nClose contacts of research subjects (see online Supplement for details) were invited to join in a surveillance study to obtain information about the frequency of natural transmission of RG-RV-A16 colds and their clinical characteristics. Consenting contacts collected cold-like symptom scores using the modified Jackson Criteria beginning on the day of inoculation (Visit 1) and for 10 consecutive days. If cold symptoms were reported, the contacts were asked to collect nasal secretions using a nose-blow technique [20] for viral diagnostics.\nStatistical Analysis\nSample size was estimated by examining operating characteristics of the proposed dose ranging study design in a variety of scenarios. Expected findings were based on the results of a previous dose-ranging study of RV-A16 (Lot 1086) that was grown with standard techniques and tested in 2000\u20132001 in which an infecting dose of 1000 TCID50/mL was associated with median (11 of 39) and mean (11.4 of 39) peak symptom scores in the moderate range and at least 75% of subjects with moderate-to-severe colds (Table 3). The expected sample size for the optimal dose or closest available dose ranged from 9 to 10 subjects. The probability that no cohort will receive the closest available dose to the target was 1.4% or less in all but 1 scenario. The relationship between dose (log-transformed) and the rate of colds of at least moderate intensity (maximal weekly symptom score of \u22657 of 39 on the modified Jackson criteria) after inoculation was assessed using logistic regression models. The logistic regression equation will be solved for the optimal dose, eg, the dose for which the estimated rate of moderate-to-severe colds is 75%.\nRESULTS\nProduction of Recombinant Rhinovirus-A16\nThe recombinant inoculum was produced using 4 steps: (1) viral cloning, (2) transcription of viral RNA, (3) transfection into Wis.L cells, and (4) purification and resuspension of the inoculum virus (Figure 1; see online Supplement for details).\nFigure 1.\nOpen in new tabDownload slide\nOverview of conventional and reverse genetics approaches to producing a rhinovirus (RV) inoculum. RNA, ribonucleic acid.\nThe source of the recombinant RV-A16 genetic sequence was a previous lot of RV-A16 human inoculum (KC939) that was cryopreserved in 1985. KC939 had been used extensively for virus inoculation [5, 21\u201326] and as a source virus for production of 2 other viral inocula (WIS1086 and WIS1088 virus) grown using traditional culture techniques (Figure 1) that were used in additional experimental inoculation studies [19, 27, 28]. The viral RNA was extracted, and overlapping cDNA segments of the viral genome were amplified by RT-PCR, cloned, and sequenced. The cloned cDNA segments with the consensus sequences were selected and then assembled in a stepwise fashion into 1 cDNA clone with the full-length viral genome (Supplemental Figure 3). The resulting plasmid, pR16.939, was sequenced entirely and no unexpected sequence was found (GenBank accession number KX891411).\nTo produce infectious virus, RV-A16 RNA was synthesized and then transfected into HLF-VC1 cells. Infectious virus was released by freeze/thaw, and debris was removed by filtration and centrifugation. Safety testing of the RG-RV-A16 inoculum revealed no evidence of toxins or adventitious agents (Supplemental Table 2).\nSequence Analysis of Reverse Genetics-Rhinovirus-A16 Compared to Two Traditional Inoculum Viruses\nThe error rate for RV 3C polymerase is high (~1 \u00d7 10\u20134), and RV types exist as quasispecies with consensus sequences that can rapidly adapt to different conditions in vitro and in vivo [1, 29]. Because RG-RV-A16 was produced with 1 round of replication, compared to use of 2 or more passages using traditional techniques, we hypothesized that the RG procedures would introduce fewer mutations from the reference sequence. To test this hypothesis, we compared the full-length sequence for KC939 to those of RG-RV-A16 and 2 inocula (1086 and 1088) produced from KC939 using conventional techniques; RG-RV-A16 had 2 mutations, 1086 had 7 mutations, and 1088 had 4 mutations (Figure 2).\nFigure 2.\nOpen in new tabDownload slide\nComparisons of gene sequences of rhinovirus (RV)-A16 inocula.

The 36 study subjects who were inoculated had a mean age of 25.6 years and included 10 men and 26 women (Table 1). Individuals who met study criteria and provided informed consent were similar to the screened population (Table 1).\nFigure 3.\nOpen in new tabDownload slide\nSelection of study subjects.

Although none of the subjects reported colds at the time of inoculation, 5 subjects (1, 2, and 2 subjects in the 100, 500, and 1000 TCID50 dosing groups, respectively) were found to have community-acquired RV genotypes in their nasal secretions at baseline and/or during the first week after inoculation. These subjects were excluded from the analysis of RG-RV-A16 effects on cold symptoms and viral RNA shedding. Due to the low remaining number (n = 4) of subjects inoculated with 500 TCID50/mL, this dosing level was not included in subsequent analyses. Two of 10 subjects inoculated with placebo had community-acquired RVs detected in their nasal secretions 21 days after mock-inoculation.\nPrimary Outcome\nInoculation with RG-RV-A16 induced clinical colds in most individuals, and the percentage of colds that were at least moderate in severity was dose related (Table 2); 0 of 10 (0%) in the placebo group, 4 of 9 (44%) in the 100 TCID50 group, and 7 of 8 (87.5%) in the 1000 TCID50 group. Thus, the 1000 TCID50 dose met the dose selection criteria for the study.\nTable 2.\nNumber of Moderate-Severe Colds (Peak Score \u22657) at Each Dosing Level\nDose (TCID50/mL) Peak Scores <7 Peak Scores \u22657 Excluded From Analysisa\n0 (placebo)  10 (100%)  0 (0%)  0 \n100  5 (56%)  4 (44%)  1 \n500  2 (50%)  2 (50%)  2 \n1000  1 (12.5%)  7 (87.5%)  2 \nAbbreviations: TCID50, median tissue culture infectious dose.\naSubjects who had community-acquired viruses detected in nasal secretions during the acute cold phase were excluded from the analysis.\nOpen in new tab\nSecondary Outcomes\nAll subjects who were inoculated with RG-RV-A16 in both dose groups were infected as indicated by detection of RG-RV-A16 RNA in all samples of nasal secretions obtained within 7 days after inoculation (Figure 4). Rhinovirus inoculation significantly increased cold symptom scores 2\u20135 days after inoculation, and all subjects shed RG-RV-A16 in nasal secretions for at least 7 days after inoculation. Serum samples obtained at day 7 postinoculation (PI) were negative for viremia (data not shown). Neutralizing antibody responses 21\u201328 days PI were similar for the 100 TCID50 and 1000 TCID50 dosing groups (6 of 8 subjects in each group were positive [\u22651:2.8], with 1 missing value in the 100 TCID50 group).\nFigure 4.\nOpen in new tabDownload slide\nEffects of inoculation with reverse genetics-rhinovirus (RG-RV)-A16. After inoculation with placebo or RG-RV-A16 (100 or 1000 median tissue culture infectious dose [TCID50]), clinical symptoms (daily symptom score), viral shedding (RV ribonucleic acid [RNA]), and leukocytes in nasal secretions were measured during the acute cold and during recovery. *, P \u2264 .05 compared with placebo; \u2020, P \u2264 .05 compared with 100 TCID50 dose.\nSeveral dose-related effects were noted when comparing the course of the cold after inoculation with 1000 vs 100 TCID50 (Figure 4). The 1000 TCID50 group reported slightly higher symptom scores at baseline (median 0 vs 1, P = .05). After inoculation, the 1000 TCID50 group had increased symptoms scores 1\u20133 days PI and greater viral RNA shedding 2\u20133 days PI. Inoculation with 1000 but not 100 TCID50 increased leukocyte counts in nasal wash fluid. Peak symptom scores for each group were also dose related; mean values were 2.0, 7.2, and 12.3 for the placebo, 100 and 1000 TCID50 dosing groups (Table 3). The timing of peak symptom scores was similar, and occurred 4 days after inoculation with 100 TCID50, and 3 days after inoculation with 1000 TCID50 (medians, P = nonsignificant).\nTable 3.\nPeak Symptom Scores Caused by Inoculation With a Conventional Inoculum (1086) Compared With RG-RV-A16\nDose (TCID50/mL) 1086 RV-A16 RG-RV-A16\nn Mean (SD) Median (25%\u201375%) n Mean (SD) Median (25%\u201375%)\n0 (placebo)  9  3.2 (2.9)  2 (1\u20135.3)  10  2.0 (2.1)  2.0 (0\u20133.0) \n100  8  4.6 (3.8)  3 (2\u20137)  9  7.2 (5.2)a  6.0 (3.0\u20139.8) \n1000  10  11.4 (5.0)  11 (9\u201316)  8  12.3 (7.8)b  10.5 (9.0\u201314) \nAbbreviations: RG, reverse genetics; RV, rhinovirus; SD, standard deviation; TCID50, median tissue culture infectious dose.\naP = .01 vs placebo.\nbP = .004 vs placebo.\nOpen in new tab\nTransmission of Reverse Genetics-Rhinovirus-A16 Colds to Household and Close Contacts\nA total of 42 household or close contacts of study subjects consented to surveillance for natural transmission of RG-RV-A16. Three contacts reported cold symptoms during the 10-day monitoring period. One contact tested positive for a community virus (RV-A94), one tested positive for the inoculum virus (RG-RV-A16), and the third tested negative for RV and other common respiratory viruses. The contact who tested positive for the inoculum virus had mild respiratory symptoms 2 days after subject inoculation, which resolved by day 3. Cold symptoms then restarted 9 days after the index inoculation and peaked (score = 13) over the next 2\u20133 days. She reported symptoms (headache, congestion) consistent with sinusitis; however, the symptoms had completely resolved 1 week later (21 days after the index inoculation). Nasal secretions of the household contact tested positive for the RV-A16 inoculum strain 4 and 14 days after inoculation of the index case.\nAdverse Events\nStudy subjects who were inoculated with RG-RV-A16 had 3 adverse events classified as related or possibly related to inoculation: a cold sore 22 days PI, 2 episodes of sinusitis (including the household contact as mentioned above), and anterior cervical lymphadenopathy during the acute illness. All were transient and judged as mild in severity.\nComparing Illnesses Caused by Reverse-Genetics Versus Conventional Rhinovirus-A16 Inocula\nIn 2000, we performed a dose-ranging study of a RV-A16 inoculum (1086) that was produced using conventional procedures (Figure 1). The procedures used in the 2 studies were similar, except that different devices (Devilbiss atomizer [27] vs Mucosal Atomization Device [Teleflex, Morrisville, NC] in the current study) were used to atomize and administer the viral suspension. In each case, the dose needed to produce colds of at least moderate severity in 75% of the participants was 1000 TCID50, and the mean peak symptom scores were similar (Table 3).\nDISCUSSION\nThis study establishes that RV for use in human inoculation studies can be produced using RG technology. Advantages of this approach include increased assurance that the viral inoculum is not contaminated with extraneous pathogens, because the seed virus is derived from cloned RV sequence in pathogen-free cultured cells instead of undefined nasal secretions. In this dose-ranging inoculation study, a dose of 1000 TCID50 produced colds in 85% of those inoculated. It is notable that viral replication and cold symptoms were quite similar to those induced by a previous inoculum virus produced using traditional techniques.\nAnother advantage of this approach is that the cloned virus provides a genetically stable source of virus. The E coli polymerase that is used to replicate the plasmid has an error rate of ~10\u20139, compared with ~10\u20134 for picornavirus polymerases. Thus, the sequence on the plasmid is quite stable, and this enables a reliable source for virus production. This is an important feature because picornaviruses that are serially passaged in tissue culture adapt quickly to cultured cells that can change their functional characteristics [30]. We demonstrated that the RG-RV-A16 suspension acquired numerically fewer mutations compared with conventionally grown viruses, likely due to less time in tissue culture.\nBecause RG enables virus to be produced quickly, easily, and in large quantities, it is thus possible to use viruses that are virtually identical for inoculation studies and for in vitro studies. In contrast, many viruses now used for laboratory studies come from American Type Culture Collection isolates that are adapted to tissue culture cell lines such as HeLa cells. It is notable that the RG-RV-A16 1086 and 1088 sequences differ from those of a previously sequenced HeLa-adapted laboratory strain [31] at approximately 200 bases (data not shown). This represents a difference of approximately 3%, which is similar to the genetic discordance between a mouse and a rat. These findings underscore the utility of having a stable sequence source for RV-A16 that can be used to make virus suspensions with a high degree of sequence identity that can be used for both inoculation studies and in vitro studies.\nThis study was designed to identify the dose that would cause colds of moderate severity in at least 75% of study subjects. Symptoms and viral RNA shedding were both dose related. It is notable that 5 of 26 (19%) volunteers who were inoculated developed infections with community-acquired viruses. In these subjects, the community-acquired viruses were present but not yet symptomatic at the day of inoculation, and either coinfections or sequential infections were established. This demonstrates the importance of screening for other viruses during inoculation studies and determining the type of any viruses that are detected.\nOne challenge in conducting this study was the prolonged regulatory pathway for this first-in-human recombinant RV inoculum (Supplemental Table 3). Some of the delays were due to regulatory changes that were prompted by the 2009 H1N1 influenza epidemic, raising concerns about introducing a virus into the wild that had been synthesized in the laboratory, albeit from wild-type sequences. In addition, the detection of porcine circovirus in a live-attenuated rotavirus vaccine in 2010 [32] led to additional requirements for testing of the viral inoculum for bovine and porcine viruses that could theoretically be introduced by animal products (eg, serum) used to manufacture RG-RV-A16. Now that RG procedures for RV have been established, production of additional viral vaccines or inocula using recombinant techniques should be straightforward. Once the virus is cloned, production is a 2-day process. One significant delay in the traditional production process of inocula grown from nasal secretions is that the virus donor must undergo thorough testing for other infectious agents, and a 1-year follow-up is recommended [13]. Using a cloned virus instead of nasal secretions as the source of the seed virus obviates this 1-year delay.\nStrengths of this study include the use of a novel viral inoculum, use of viral diagnostics to identify community viruses in the study subjects, and molecular characterization of all viruses detected. We also documented for the first time the low risk (1 in 42 [2.4%]) for transmission of inoculum virus to household contacts. Another potential advantage of the RG approach is that it could be used in the future to study effects of mutations of specific viral sequences. Limitations include inclusion of healthy adults as study subjects; it is possible that individuals with chronic respiratory disease (eg, asthma, COPD) could develop upper and even lower respiratory illnesses with lower doses of virus [33].\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn conclusion, we have developed the first recombinant RV inoculum using RG techniques and demonstrated that it induces colds that are of similar intensity to those caused by traditional inocula. Using a cloned virus eliminates one potential source of contamination and provides a genetically stable source and a simplified manufacturing pathway for production of RV for human inoculation studies. Furthermore, because several RV clinical strains have been cloned [34, 35], these techniques could be used to produce additional inocula, including RV-C, for investigations into RV pathogenesis and the efficacy of antiviral drugs or vaccines.\nSupplementary Data\nSupplementary materials are available at The Journal of Infectious Diseases online.

Healthcare workers (HCWs) have elevated risk of contact with EBOV-infected patients, particularly if safety precautions are not rigorously practiced. We conducted a serosurvey to determine seroprevalence against multiple EBOV antigens among HCWs of Boende Health Zone, Democratic Republic of the Congo, the site of a 2014 EBOV outbreak. Interviews and specimens were collected from 565 consenting HCWs. Overall, 234 (41.4%) of enrolled HCWs were reactive to at least 1 EBOV protein: 159 (28.1%) were seroreactive for anti-glycoprotein immunoglobulin G (IgG), 89 (15.8%) were seroreactive for anti-nucleoprotein IgG, and 54 (9.5%) were VP40 positive. Additionally, sera from 16 (2.8%) HCWs demonstrated neutralization capacity. These data demonstrate that a significant proportion of HCWs have the ability to neutralize virus, despite never having developed Ebola virus disease symptoms, highlighting an important and poorly documented aspect of EBOV infection and progression.\nEbola virus, serology, Democratic Republic of the Congo, healthcare workers\nTopic: ebola virus democratic republic of the congo disease outbreaks health personnel ebola virus disease serologic tests neutralization seroprevalence\nIssue Section: Viruses\n(See the Editorial Commentary by Garry on pages 511\u20133.)\nOutbreaks of Ebola virus disease (EVD) represent a major public health challenge in sub-Saharan Africa. EVD was initially recognized in 1976 during simultaneous outbreaks in Za\u00efre (now Democratic Republic of the Congo [DRC]) (Za\u00efre ebolavirus [EBOV]) and Sudan (Sudan ebolavirus) [1, 2]. Since then, there have been >37 EVD outbreaks spanning 14 different countries in Africa, Europe, Asia, and North America, with the majority caused by EBOV, 8 of which (including an outbreak that is currently unfolding at the time of manuscript submission, May 2018) have occurred in the DRC [3]. During these outbreaks, there was increased infection and deaths among those healthcare workers (HCWs) charged with the responsibility of caring for those suffering with EVD, a contributing factor to outbreak progression [4].\nHealthcare workers are on the front line of patient care, and thus at increased risk of disease acquisition due to occupational exposures to bodily fluids, lack of infection control training, and a dearth of personal protective equipment. Human-to-human transmission of ebolavirus occurs through direct contact with bodily fluids (vomit, diarrhea), secretions, or blood of infected people via broken skin or mucous membranes; it may also be transmitted through contact with contaminated surfaces and materials (eg, bedding, clothing) [5\u20139]. This risk is even greater in limited resource settings of sub-Saharan Africa and has been documented in several studies assessing the seroprevalence of blood-borne pathogens in these populations [10\u201313]. Historically, HCWs have perpetuated the spread and amplification of EVD and serve as axes of viral transmission, often before ebolavirus is even recognized as the causative agent [14\u201321]. The symptoms of EVD are frequently nonspecific, characterized by fever, headache, fatigue, muscle pain, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain [22], and can easily be confused with other endemic diseases such as typhoid or malaria [23]. The difficulties associated with clinical recognition and diagnostic capabilities make prevention efforts for HCWs complex because infected workers may transmit disease before any symptoms are accurately diagnosed.\nDespite HCWs\u2019 increased risk of acquiring and transmitting the disease, there is limited research assessing the total burden of ebolavirus among HCWs [10, 15\u201318, 24]. Understanding serologic responses in high-risk populations, such as HCWs, and determining overall seroprevalence in areas with previous EVD outbreaks may provide more information on exposure. Current literature on HCWs and serological testing for ebolaviruses (for evidence of exposure) is restricted mainly to anti-glycoprotein (GP) antibody, the viral protein critical for attachment to and penetration of host cells. Because of its positioning on the virion surface, GP is a target of neutralizing antibodies and has been frequently studied as a target for vaccines and other therapeutics [22, 25\u201327]. Furthermore, Richardson et al suggest limiting the definition of EBOV seropositivity to anti-GP reactivity based on a comparison of anti-GP and anti-nucleoprotein (NP) antibody responses [28]. However, a separate experiment by Becquart and colleagues in 2014, comparing sera from asymptomatic seropositive individuals to symptomatic survivors of EVD, showed that immunoglobulin G (IgG) responses were qualitatively different in each group: The asymptomatic group displayed a larger response to EBOV matrix protein (VP40), whereas the survivors had greater IgG responses to GP [29]. These findings indicate that anti-GP alone may not be sufficient as a marker for demonstration of previous exposure, especially in asymptomatically infected or otherwise unrecognized EVD survivors.\nHere, we report the results of a serological survey of a sample of HCWs living in or near Boende, DRC, the site of an EVD outbreak that occurred 1 year prior to sample collection, in which at least 8 of the 68 (14%) reported cases were HCWs. We paired epidemiologic data with serologic detection of EBOV GP, anti-NP, and VP40, as well as microneutralization using EBOV pseudovirions to assess the presence of a range of anti-ebolavirus antibodies in this high-risk population.\nMETHODS\nEnrollment\nFrom September to November 2015, we conducted a serosurvey in the Boende health zone, located 1200 km to the northwest of Kinshasa (capital of DRC) in the province of Tshuapa (Figure 1). All individuals who met the eligibility criteria (>18 years old, healthy [no fever or other illness reported at time of enrollment], and working in a health facility, and reported being actively involved during the 2014 Boende outbreak response) were approached for enrollment in the study. All participants were screened for signs of current illness or fever; no participants included in the current analysis reported ever having been or suspected of having been infected with EBOV. In total, 565 HCWs were consented and enrolled in the study from 26 health facilities (hospitals, health centers, or health posts), and 1 church, which provided health services to the community. The study included a sociodemographic and epidemiologic questionnaire and sample collection. Blood specimens frozen, stored and tested were obtained from all consenting participants by venipuncture into red-top Vacutainer tubes (BD Biosciences). After processing, aliquots of serum were frozen and stored at the Institut National de Recherche Biomedicale in Kinshasa and shipped to the Blood Systems Research Institute in San Francisco, California, for performance of the remaining serological and neutralization assays.\nFigure 1.\nOpen in new tabDownload slide\nHealth facility locations of surveyed healthcare workers in Boende health zone, Tshuapa province, Democratic Republic of the Congo.

HCWs were classified by their potential exposure to patients based on their reported occupation. \u201cDirect contact\u201d was defined as any HCW who had direct contact with sick patients and included doctors, nurses, and traditional healers. \u201cIndirect contact\u201d was defined as any HCW who did not have direct contact with sick patients, but had contact with biologic specimens, patient materials, or family members of sick patients (eg, laboratory technicians and room cleaners). \u201cUnlikely contact\u201d was defined as any HCW who was unlikely to have contact with sick patients and included positions such as hospital guards and administrators, and those with other classifications not related to patient care (Table 1).\nTable 1.\nCategorization of Healthcare Workers by Patient Contact Using Occupation Group Among Respondents From Boende, Democratic Republic of the Congo\nPatient Contacta Occupation Group English Entries From Survey French Entries From Survey\nDirect  Nurse  Nurse, supervisor  Nurse (titulaire or supervisor), infirmier, chef de service, anesthesiste \n  Physician  Physician  Physician \n  Educational HCW  Student, teacher  Infirmiere en perfectionnement \n  Midwife  Midwife  Sage femme, matronne \n  Red cross  Paramedic, burial team  Croix rouge, secouriste \n  Traditional healer  Traditional healer  Tradipraticien(ne), guerrisseur, visionnaire des esprits \n  Pastor  Pastor  Pasteur, prier pour les malades \nIndirect  Pharmacy  Pharmacist  Pharmacien(ne), pr\u00e9pos\u00e9e a la pharmacie \n  Room attendant  Room attendant  Fille de salle, gar\u00e7on de salle, intendant poste de sante \n  Laboratory technician  Laboratory technician  Laborantin, technicien(ne) de labo, microscopiste \n  Hygiene/housekeeping  Hygienic service  Hygi\u00e8ne et assainissement, d\u00e9sinfecter, assainissement \n  Communication  Communication  Relais communautaire, assistant humanitaire \n  Surveillance  Epidemiologist  Agent de surveillance, surveillance de la maladie, recherche active des cas, veterinaire \nUnlikely  Guard  Sentinel  Sentinelle, garde, gardien, observateur \n  Driver  Driver  Conducteur, chauffeur \n  Maintenance  Maintenance  Mecanicien \n  HCW (admin)  Administration  Administrateur, admnistratif, r\u00e9ceptionniste, secr\u00e9taire, caissier \n  Ordinary worker  \u2026  Travailleur ordinaire, TO \nAbbreviation: HCW, healthcare worker.\naAssumed level of patient contact derived from occupation group.\nOpen in new tab\nSerological Testing\nEnzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assays\nHuman anti-EBOV GP IgG and anti-EBOV NP IgG titers were measured using commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits (Alpha Diagnostic International) following the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. The methodology has been described elsewhere [31]. Based on the manufacturer\u2019s calibration, a sample was classified as mildly reactive if the serum antibody concentration was >1.0 units/mL control calibrator, and reactive if the titer was >2.5 units/mL. For analysis, we only include those who were considered reactive (>2.5 units/mL).\nVP40 Reactivity via Luciferase Immunoprecipitation System\nThe C-terminal domain of EBOV VP40 (base pairs 583\u2013981) was cloned into the pRen2 plasmid and transfected into Cos-1 cells generating Renilla luciferase antigen fusion proteins. Cell lysates were harvested and used in immunoprecipitation assays with protein A/G\u2013conjugated agarose beads and test serum diluted 1:100 as described by Burbelo et al [32]. The testing procedure has been described elsewhere [31]. VP40 reactivity was determined if the relative luciferase signal postimmunoprecipitation was at least 3 standard deviations greater than the background signal, as determined from a mean of 8 previously identified VP40-seronegative samples [31].\nNeutralization Assay\nEBOV GP\u2013bearing human immunodeficiency virus pseudotype viruses were generated as described previously [33], and pseudotype virus neutralization assays were performed [31, 34, 35]. Infection rates in presence of human serum samples were expressed as percentage of infection in presence of negative control serum. To be considered neutralizing, serum from the patients had to at least neutralize approximately 50% of virus at a dilution of 1:50 compared to appropriate control.\nData Analysis\nResults from the multiple assays were compared to explore the overlap between EBOV seroreactivity. We ran cross-tabulations on all sociodemographic factors and reported occupation to explore descriptive characteristics of the population and compared these factors to their seroprevalence for each assay. We assessed differences in factors using \u03c72 or Fisher exact test. Sensitivity analyses were conducted by including mildly reactive antibody titers with the reactive antibody titers. All analyses were completed using R 3.4.2 and SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute) software.\nEthical Approval\nEthical approval was obtained from the institutional review boards at the University of California, Los Angeles Fielding School of Public Health and the Kinshasa School of Public Health, DRC.\nRESULTS\nParticipant Characteristics\nAmong the 565 HCWs, 370 (65.5%) were male and 195 (34.5%) were female (Table 2). The median age of HCWs was 40 years (interquartile range, 31.8\u201350 years). More than half (363 [64.2%]) of participants worked in a health facility, including the general hospital, health centers, and health posts, and 61 (10.8%) reported working in other facilities, whereas 141 (25.0%) of the participants did not identify working in any facility; this includes traditional healers, pastors, and community workers. Approximately half (279 [50.1%]) had direct contact with patients, whereas 177 (31.8%) had indirect contact and 101 (18.1%) were unlikely to have patient contact.\nTable 2.\nDemographic Information and Antibody Profile for 565 Healthcare Workers in Boende, Democratic Republic of the Congo\nCharacteristic Total GP1-649 Reactive NP Reactive VP40 Reactive Neutralization\nSex \nFemale  195 (34.5)  31 (15.9)  17 (8.7)  14 (7.2)  3 (1.5) \nMale  370 (65.5)  73 (19.7)a  45 (12.2)  40 (10.8)  13 (3.5) \nAge, y \n<25  46 (8.2)  11 (23.9)  7 (15.2)  6 (13.0)  4 (8.7) \n25\u201334  142 (25.4)  29 (20.4)  9 (6.3)  11 (7.7)  2 (1.4) \n35\u201344  166 (29.6)  30 (18.1)  20 (12.0)  17 (10.2)  4 (2.4) \n45\u201354  115 (20.5)  18 (15.7)  16 (13.9)  11 (9.6)  4 (3.4) \n\u226555  91 (16.2)  16 (17.6)  9 (9.9)  9 (9.9)  2 (2.2) \nFacility type \nCentral office  28 (5.0)  4 (14.3)  3 (10.7)  0 (0.0)  0 (0.0) \nEbola treatment center  8 (1.4)  0 (0.0)  0 (0.0)  1 (12.5)  0 (0.0) \nHealth center  186 (32.9)  28 (15.1)  22 (11.8)  15 (8.1)  5 (2.7) \nHealth post  85 (15.0)  24 (28.2)  15 (17.6)a  8 (9.4)  2 (2.4) \nHospital  92 (16.3)  11 (12.0)  7 (7.6)  6 (6.5)  3 (3.3) \nNone  141 (25.0)  32 (22.7)  13 (9.2)  19 (13.5)  6 (4.3) \nOther  25 (4.4)  5 (20)  2 (8.0)a  5 (20.0)a  0 (0.0) \nPatient contact \nDirect  279 (50.1)  57 (20.4)  30 (10.8)  29 (10.4)  9 (3.2) \nIndirect  177 (31.8)  29 (16.4)  21 (11.9)  12 (6.8)  4 (2.3) \nUnlikely  101 (18.1)  18 (17.8)a  10 (9.9)  12 (11.9)  3 (3.0) \nData are presented as No. (%).

Males had a higher seroprevalence compared with females regardless of the test (46.2% vs 33.3%, respectively; P = .01) and showed a significant difference for GP reactivity (19.7% vs 15.9%, respectively; P < .001) and NP reactivity (12.2% vs 8.7%, respectively; P = .02). While age was not statistically significant, seroreactivity for all assays decreased with increasing age. Among all HCWs, 234 (41.4%) were seroreactive for at least 1 assay (Figure 2). The greatest overlap of responses was across HCWs who were both NP and GP seropositive (n = 29 [5.1%]). Importantly, all neutralization-positive individuals were also reactive for at least 1 other distinct viral protein (ie, either VP40 and/or NP). Of those who demonstrated neutralizing capacity (n = 16), 8 presented both NP and VP40 reactivity (50.0%). However, only 3 HCWs were seroreactive for all 4 assays.\nFigure 2.\nOpen in new tabDownload slide\nVenn diagram of overlapping immunoreactivity assay measures in healthcare workers who participated in the Boende outbreak, Democratic Republic of the Congo, 2014. Abbreviations: GP, glycoprotein; NP, nucleoprotein; VP40, Ebola virus matrix protein.\nWhile no statistically significant differences for serologic response were observed across direct, indirect, and unlikely patient contact occupational categories, there was considerable heterogeneity in serologic response across occupation types (Table 3 and Figure 3). The scatterplot presented in Figure 3 presents the distribution of test results by HCW contact type. Among HCWs considered in direct contact with patients, traditional healers, pastors, and midwives had the highest GP and NP seroprevalence (excluding physicians due to sample size, n = 2), whereas Red Cross workers had the highest VP40 seroprevalence and neutralizing capacity (22.2% and 5.6% respectively; P < .05). HCWs having indirect contact with patient demonstrated similar heterogeneity across occupations. Those classified as having unlikely contacts with patients had the highest GP seroprevalence among all groups: health administrators, guards, and other (24.0%, 28.6%, and 8.0%, respectively).\nTable 3.\nAntibody Profile by Contact Level (Inferred by Occupation) for Healthcare Workers in Boende, Democratic Republic of the Congo\nOccupation Total GP1-649 Reactive NP Reactive VP40 Reactive Neutralization\nDirect \nDoctor  2 (0.7)  1 (50.0)  1 (50.0)  0 (0.0)  0 (0.0) \nHealth educator  12 (4.4)  2 (16.7)  0 (0.0)  2 (16.7)  0 (0.0) \nMidwife  42 (15.3)  11 (26.2)  6 (14.3)  5 (11.9)  1 (2.4) \nNurse  155 (56.4)  24 (15.5)  14 (9.0)  13 (8.4)  4 (2.6) \nPastor  24 (8.7)  6 (25.0)  3 (12.5)  3 (12.5)  2 (8.3) \nRed Cross worker  18 (6.5)  4 (22.2)  1 (5.6)  4 (22.2)  1 (5.6) \nTraditional healer  22 (8.0)  8 (36.4)  3 (13.6)  3 (13.6)  0 (0.0) \nIndirect \nCommunication  6 (3.1)  1 (16.7)  0 (0.0)  0 (0.0)  0 (0.0) \nHygiene  76 (39.2)  12 (15.8)  12 (15.8)  8 (10.5)  3 (3.9) \nLaboratory technician  5 (2.6)  2 (40.0)  0 (0.0)  0 (0.0)  0 (0.0) \nPharmacy  10 (5.2)  1 (10.0)  1 (10.0)  0 (0.0)  0 (0.0) \nRoom attendant  90 (46.4)  15 (16.7)  10 (11.1)  6 (6.7)  3 (3.3) \nSurveillance  7 (3.6)  0 (0.0)  0 (0.0)  0 (0.0)  0 (0.0) \nUnlikely \nDriver  5 (5.2)  0 (0.0)  1 (20.0)  1 (20.0)  0 (0.0) \nGuard  21 (21.9)  6 (28.6)  2 (9.5)  2 (9.5)  0 (0.0) \nHealth administration  25 (26.0)  6 (24.0)  1 (4.0)  0 (0.0)  0 (0.0) \nMaintenance  9 (9.4)  0 (0.0)  0 (0.0)  1 (11.1)  0 (0.0) \nOrdinary worker  11 (11.5)  3 (27.3)  2 (18.2)  0 (0.0)  0 (0.0) \nOther  25 (26.0)  2 (8.0)a  5 (20.0)  6 (24.0)  2 (8.0) \nData are presented as No. (%).

A serological survey conducted during Kikwit EBOV outbreak found prevalence of 2.2% among health workers and 9.3% in surrounding villages [41]. A recent study in Watsa in the northeastern region of the DRC reported an EBOV seroprevalence of 18.7% in the local Efe population [42].\nWhen exploring trends by patient contact, the highest GP seroprevalence was observed in the \u201cunlikely\u201d contact group. However, within each category there was significant heterogeneity. These differences may be explained by the fact that, in an outbreak situation, everyone, including guards and administrators, could be required to assist with potentially infected persons when regular hospital staff are not able to meet the demands of the patients, potentially leading to exposures to bodily fluids, sick patients, or community members. This group also likely reflects the general population and may indicate that there is endemic EBOV exposure in this area. However, overall these results most likely suggest that the GP ELISA as a standalone test is relatively nonspecific. This may be due to unrelated nonspecific binding, with the high degree of glycosylation in EBOV GP lending itself to such nonspecific recognition. Alternately, it may be that GP is more sensitive than other viral proteins to the presence of cross-reactive antibodies directed against related viruses. In contrast, the unique mechanism of ebolavirus entry lends itself to highly specific, but possibly insensitive, detection of prior ebolavirus infection [43].\nHCWs enrolled in this study demonstrated seroreactivity to multiple EBOV proteins. Furthermore, we identified that 16 (2.8%) of HCWs who never reported infection were not only seroreactive for at least 1 serologic test but may also be able to neutralize ebolavirus if exposed to EVD. This includes 3 individuals who were seroreactive on all tests and exhibited neutralizing capacity: a 52-year-old midwife, a 48-year-old administrator, and a 78-year-old volunteer. It is not known whether seroreactivity to assays is related to EBOV exposure during the 2014 outbreak\u2014in particular because all HCWs included for this analysis participated in the outbreak response and reported varying levels of contact with EVD patients and biological specimens. It may also be possible that variation in antigenic response and neutralization levels may be related to asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic infection, which would not have been necessarily detected as illness due to EBOV [44]. It is possible that some seroreactive individuals could also have been exposed to a non-EBOV filovirus.\nThere were several limitations to this study. We were unable to interview every HCW from every health facility in the health zone, notably missing HCWs in Lokolia, which is the village in which the outbreak was concentrated, due to logistical constraints such as impassable roads. We attempted to make our study population as diverse as possible by enrolling participants in both formal and informal settings, and those who may have been displaced from their normal facility to support the outbreak response. There may have been some misclassification of specific HCW occupations, and patient contact was categorized based on occupation type and not recall of contact exposures. In addition, HCWs may play multiple different roles depending on the need of the facility during the outbreak response. We attempted to classify them based on their primary position in the health facility. Furthermore, all results are based on serologic assays, so adjusting the cutoff value can affect the overall results. Thus, we explored the range of responses (Figure 3) from each assay and used a higher manufacturer cutoff based on the calibration curve provided, assuming a higher background rate of cross-reactivity.\nOur study highlights the elevated risk of HCWs in DRC and exposure to blood-borne pathogens in general. Providing adequate training of HCWs to infection control procedures and availability of personal protective equipment to reduce exposure to bodily fluids of patients they treat before an EVD outbreak occurs is ultimately one of the most important strategies to limit the spread of ebolavirus and other blood-borne pathogens of both high and low consequence. Furthermore, our findings raise additional questions about EBOV exposure, risk, and circulating virus in DRC. Currently, there is no serological gold standard for ebolavirus serology. Our results highlight the need for additional research to better understand the roles each protein plays in immune response. Better understanding of the significance of EVD seroreactivity and risk factors associated with these exposures will improve our ability to design and implement locally sustainable strategies to limit exposure of HCWs to ebolavirus and other pathogens.\nNotes\nAuthor contributions.\u2003A.

We aimed to identify all case-control studies investigating the potential role of respiratory viruses in the etiology of ARI in older adults aged \u226565 years. We conducted a systematic literature review (across 7 databases) of case-control studies published from 1996 to 2017 that investigated the viral profile of older adults with and those without ARI. We then computed a pooled odds ratio (OR) with a 95% confidence interval and virus-specific attributable fraction among the exposed (AFE) for 8 common viruses: respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza virus (Flu), parainfluenza virus (PIV), human metapneumovirus (HMPV), adenovirus (AdV), rhinovirus (RV), bocavirus (BoV), and coronavirus (CoV). From the 16 studies included, there was strong evidence of possible causal attribution for RSV (OR, 8.5 [95% CI, 3.9\u201318.5]; AFE, 88%), Flu (OR, 8.3 [95% CI, 4.4\u201315.9]; AFE, 88%), PIV (OR, not available; AFE, approximately 100%), HMPV (OR, 9.8 [95% CI, 2.3\u201341.0]; AFE, 90%), AdV (OR, not available; AFE, approximately 100%), RV (OR, 7.1 [95% CI, 3.7\u201313.6]; AFE, 86%) and CoV (OR, 2.8 [95% CI, 2.0\u20134.1]; AFE, 65%) in older adults presenting with ARI, compared with those without respiratory symptoms (ie, asymptomatic individuals) or healthy older adults. However, there was no significant difference in the detection of BoV in cases and controls. This review supports RSV, Flu, PIV, HMPV, AdV, RV, and CoV as important causes of ARI in older adults and provides quantitative estimates of the absolute proportion of virus-associated ARI cases to which a viral cause can be attributed. Disease burden estimates should take into account the appropriate AFE estimates (for older adults) that we report.\nEtiological role, respiratory virus, acute respiratory infection, older adults\nTopic: adult cost of illness respiratory tract infections viruses older adult\nIssue Section: Supplement Article\nAcute respiratory tract infections (ARI), including pneumonia, constitute a substantial disease burden in adults and elderly individuals. Respiratory viruses are detected more frequently than bacteria in adults with pneumonia [1]. The substantial contribution of viruses to ARI hospitalizations among adults is being increasingly recognized [2, 3].\nAlthough influenza virus (Flu) is the most widely recognized viral infection associated with respiratory illness, >25 viruses have been linked to pneumonia, causing a substantial disease burden in adults and elderly individuals. These include common pathogens such as rhinovirus (RV), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), Flu, human metapneumovirus (hMPV), parainfluenza viruses (PIV), and human coronaviruses (CoVs) [2]. RSV is associated with a substantial disease burden in adults, especially among older adults (aged \u226565 years) [4]. Moreover, adults hospitalized with RSV disease can develop severe respiratory complications [5]. RV has been associated with severe respiratory disease outbreaks in adults in long-term care facilities in several settings [6]. Despite advances in diagnostic technology, defining the specific causes of viral pneumonia is challenging, particularly among older adults who may have lower viral loads and for whom viral diagnosis is frequently not considered and/or testing is not performed [7]. Therefore, it is necessary to measure concurrently the background prevalence of nasopharyngeal viral infection in a control (asymptomatic) group, to investigate the etiological role of viruses in older adults with ARI to help inform decisions on prevention and management strategies.\nPreviously, we have conducted a systematic review to understand the etiological role of common respiratory viruses, focusing on children aged <5 years [8]. To the best of our knowledge, similar estimates for adults are lacking. Therefore, we aimed to conduct a similar systematic review to identify all case-control studies since 1996 investigating the potential role of respiratory viruses in the etiology of ARIs in older adults aged \u226565 years.\nMETHODS\nSearch Strategy and Selection Criteria\nWe conducted a systematic review across 7 databases (including 3 Chinese databases) following the approach detailed in the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses) guidelines [9]. Tailored search strategies were developed and used to search the Medline, Embase, Global Health, LILACS, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Wanfang Data, and Chongqing VIP databases (Appendix). We further searched the reference lists of relevant articles for eligible articles. All searches were limited to between January 1996 and August 2017. No publication status criteria or language restrictions were used. We included studies that fulfilled the following selection criteria (Supplementary Figure 1).\nThree investigators (T. S., A. A., and I. S.) conducted independent searches of the English-language literature and extracted data by using standardized data extraction templates. One investigator (T. S.), whose first language is Chinese, searched and extracted data from Chinese-language databases (ie, CNKI, Wanfang, and CQVIP).\nThe protocol of this review was published in the PROSPERO database (no. CRD42017083332).\nDefinitions\nThe case group was defined as older adults with ARI or pneumonia aged \u226565 years, adapted from World Health Organization Integrated Management of Adolescent and Adult Illness [10]. The details of the definitions are displayed in Supplementary Table 1. The control group was defined as older adults aged \u226565 years who were either healthy or did not have any respiratory symptoms. We categorized countries as either industrialized or developing, on the basis of 2015 criteria from the United Nations Children\u2019s Fund [11].\nStatistical Analysis\nWe calculated odds ratios (ORs) as the ratio of the odds of detecting each virus in older adults with ARI or pneumonia to the odds of detecting each virus in healthy or asymptomatic controls, with accompanying 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We used a continuity correction of 0.0005 if a virus was detected in one group but not the other [12]. This allowed calculation of an OR for these instances and enabled inclusion in subsequent meta-analyses.\nUsing Stata (version 13.0), we performed a meta-analysis of virus-specific ORs and reported pooled meta-estimates with corresponding 95% CIs, using the random effects model (ie, the DerSimonian-Laird method) because the included studies are heterogeneous in various aspects and are thus assumed to have different effect sizes [13]. The virus-specific attributable fraction among the exposed (AFE) was used to quantify the etiological role of each virus in patients with ARI. This is an estimate of the percentage of ARIs that can be attributed to each virus, in absolute terms [14], and was calculated as 100 * [OR \u2212 1]/OR, with a 95% CI (from the corresponding 95% CI of the OR). Moreover, for a specific virus, if all included studies did not report any virus detection in one group consistently (usually the control group), we assumed that a strong association indicating a possible causal role for this virus in ARI could be concluded. In these circumstances, we considered that there was no need to run a meta-analysis that would only result in an extremely high OR point estimate and an AFE approaching 100%.\nRESULTS\nWe identified 4327 (239 from Chinese databases) records through the literature search and 5 records from the reference lists of relevant articles. Among them, only 16 studies (including 2 from Chinese databases) fulfilled our inclusion and exclusion criteria (Figure 1) [1, 15\u201329]. Forty-three studies were excluded for a variety of reasons: no data specific to older adults \u226565 years old were available (n = 1), the case or control definitions were not fulfilled (n = 4), no applicable data for cases and controls were reported (n = 36), or serum was used as the clinical specimen (n = 2). Seven studies were conducted within developing countries, while 9 were from developed countries (Supplementary Table 2). Although the search was performed for articles published since 1996, all included studies were published since 2003.\nFigure 1.\nOpen in new tabDownload slide\nPRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses) flow diagram of the literature search.\nAll included studies were case-control studies with adults who had ARI or pneumonia in the case group and asymptomatic or healthy adults in the control group. Methods varied among studies. Among the case definitions used, 7 studies used ARI or acute lower respiratory tract infection, while the others used (severe) pneumonia (n = 9). All studies investigated a control group, which had no respiratory symptoms, and in 3 studies healthy older adults (without acute illness) served as controls. Of the case ascertainment methods used, 8 articles recruited the cases from inpatients; 1, from outpatients; 3, from general practices; 1, from the community; and 3, from mixed settings (outpatient settings and the emergency department, and both outpatient and inpatient settings). In 11 studies, controls were ascertained in hospital-based outpatient or clinic sites, whereas in 5 studies, controls were identified from the community. All studies collected a mixture of nasopharyngeal swab specimens, nasopharyngeal aspirates, nasopharyngeal washes, oropharyngeal swab specimens, and nasal/throat swab specimens as the clinical specimen. All studies used polymerase chain reaction analysis (PCR; in some, PCR was combined with serologic analysis or culture) as the diagnostic test.\nMeta-analyses of virus-specific ORs are reported as well as the corresponding attributable fractions among the exposed (Supplementary Table 3). RSV, Flu (including Flu A), hMPV, RV, and CoV (also CoV OC43 and 229E) were significantly more common in older adults with a diagnosis of ARI or pneumonia than in asymptomatic or healthy controls (ORs, 8.5 [95% CI, 3.9\u201318.5], 8.3 [95% CI, 4.4\u201315.9], 9.8 [95% CI, 2.3\u201341.0], 7.1 [95% CI, 3.7\u201313.6], and 2.8 [95% CI, 2.0\u20134.1], respectively). These viruses had statistically significant positive AFEs, which showed clear associations between these viruses and ARI or pneumonia in older adults. Moreover, PIV (including PIV1 and PIV3; data for PIV2 and PIV4 were not available), Flu B, and AdV were only identified in cases consistently across all included studies (8, 5, and 8 studies, respectively) and absent in control groups. Thus, these viruses were all assumed to have strong associations with ARI. Only 2 studies had data available for BoV, and although both reported virus detection in a greater proportion of cases than controls [18, 28], the association remains a question for further research.\nA subgroup analysis was performed to explore the roles of viruses in ARI with respect to region: developing countries and industrialized countries. The meta-estimate OR was higher in industrialized countries as compared to developing countries in the case of Flu (with overlapping 95% CIs), while it was similar for PIV, AdV, and RV. There were insufficient studies to conduct a similar subgroup analysis for other viruses. A sensitivity analysis was performed to investigate the roles of these common viruses in older adults admitted to hospitals with ARI or pneumonia [1, 16, 20, 22, 23, 25, 27, 28]. Eight studies were included, and results are presented in Supplementary Table 4. The meta-estimate OR did not differ significantly from the previous estimate, in which cases from other settings (ie, outpatient and general practice settings) were also included.\nDISCUSSION\nThis is the first systematic review to evaluate and summarize the literature that includes concurrent control data on the viral etiology of ARI in older adults. Our review summarized data from 5560 cases of ARI in older adults reported across 16 studies. We demonstrated strong evidence in support of a potential causal attribution when a virus is identified in older adults presenting with ARI or pneumonia for RSV (OR, 8.5 [95% CI, 3.9\u201318.5]; AFE, 88%), Flu (OR, 8.3 [95% CI, 4.4\u201315.9]; AFE, 88%), PIV (OR, not available [NA]; AFE, approximately 100%), hMPV (OR, 9.8 [95% CI, 2.3\u201341.0]; AFE, 90%), AdV (OR, NA; AFE, approximately 100%), RV (OR, 7.1 [95% CI, 3.7\u201313.6]; AFE, 86%), and CoV (OR, 2.8 [95% CI, 2.0\u20134.1]; AFE, 65%). This supports an etiological role of RSV, Flu, PIV, hMPV, AdV, RV, and CoV in ARI and pneumonia in older adults, thereby indicating a potential for substantive reductions in the number of ARI cases if older adults were vaccinated against these viruses or treated with antivirals. For the other respiratory viruses studied, the role of BoV in ARI and pneumonia was uncertain because of the limited evidence available from the published literature, requiring more research to clarify its role in older adults with ARI. A sensitivity analysis focusing only on older adults who were admitted to hospitals with ARI or pneumonia did not differ significantly from our estimate, in which patients from all settings were considered. This might result from the limited number of studies available to provide a more robust sensitivity analysis. No studies calculated adjusted ORs to account for confounding effects from age or season, which might compromise the actual association and should be considered in the study design in future research.\nThese findings should inform the results of studies that seek to estimate the global, regional, and national burden of disease due to these viruses in older adults [30]. They show that RSV, Flu, PIV, hMPV, AdV, RV, and CoV are important causes of ARI in older adults, and disease burden estimates should take into account the appropriate AFE estimates (for older adults) that we report, rather than the AFE estimates in children aged <5 years. There is considerable international attention on RSV-associated ARI in older adults at this time, during which novel vaccine and antiviral strategies are being evaluated and prioritized [31, 32], and more-accurate disease burden estimates (using these results) would help to inform future policies and interventions.\nThe prevalence of virus detection from etiologic studies of pneumonia in adults is substantially lower than the detection rate in studies of children. The EPIC (Etiology of Pneumonia in the Community) study team showed that the viruses were detected in 26% of adults who had been hospitalized with community-acquired pneumonia, compared with 73% of children who were admitted to the hospital [1, 33]. There are several reasons for such low levels of detection, such as the inability to obtain lower respiratory tract specimens, the use of diagnostic tests with insufficient sensitivity, the absence of appropriate diagnostic testing methods, the undetectability of the virus at the time of the study, and the presence of unknown pathogens that were not identified. The low rate of virus detection among adults who were hospitalized for pneumonia highlights the need for more-sensitive diagnostic approaches, innovative discovery of pathogens, and assessing viruses in the past history (weeks before the presence of disease) [34]. Moreover, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbation is a very important cause of ARIs and hospital admissions [35]. Only 7 of 16 studies included COPD in the etiologic data, and this information was unclear in the remaining studies, which might have underestimated the role of viral infection in these patients.\nA previous etiological review focusing on young children aged <5 years [8] showed that RSV, Flu (including Flu A), PIV, hMPV, and RV were significantly more common in children hospitalized with acute lower respiratory tract infection than asymptomatic controls. The associations of these viruses (except RSV) with ARI and pneumonia were stronger among adults. This is in part because, in comparison to young children, the detection of viruses in the control group (ie, among individuals without respiratory symptoms or healthy controls) was less common in older adults, with the exception of RSV.\nSeveral methodological issues could affect our results: sample size, age group, case ascertainment, clinical specimen, and diagnostic testing. Although a thorough search has been performed across 7 databases, including 3 Chinese-language databases, only 16 studies from the published literature were identified, which met our selection criteria. Not every virus of interest was tested in each study. The number of studies available was even smaller when subgroup analyses and sensitivity analyses were performed. Moreover, the sample size varied from 50 to 2320 adults in the case group and from 27 to 541 adults in the control group. The small sample size undoubtedly contributed to the imprecise 95% CIs around the ORs. Thus, we may have failed to detect clinically significant ARI-virus associations, owing to small sample sizes.\nWe aimed to stratify the association between common respiratory viruses in adults with ARI or pneumonia by age. However, most articles did not stratify and report data by age group. Instead, they summarized the result for the entire age group, usually in adults aged >18 years. Therefore, some of our meta-estimate ORs may not be representative of older adults who are aged \u226565 years. Since age might be a risk factor for ARI in adults (the rate of severe ARI increases as age advances), this could potentially affect the viral profile detected, introducing further heterogeneity [1].\nFifteen of 16 studies used passive clinic or hospital based case ascertainment. Among them, cases were recruited from inpatients, outpatients, emergency departments, or general practices, which might reflect different healthcare behavior and disease severity. Also, since the episodes of ARI and pneumonia were only diagnosed through routine care, this introduced bias, considering that testing was only done when the clinicians deemed it necessary to test. Similarly, 5 studies used community-based controls, while another 11 studies recruited older adult controls from hospitals or general practices. Hospital or clinical ascertained controls may not reflect the general population and may have other health conditions potentially affecting their viral carriage. Moreover, recruiting controls who were selected as healthy or without respiratory symptoms could favor those who were not exposed to the respiratory virus (yielding a falsely high OR). Therefore, we consider that the ideal control group for these studies would be a random sample of an age- and sex-matched population of older adults who are from the same area of residence and studied at the same time as cases.\nAll included studies obtained upper respiratory tract specimens (described as nasopharyngeal secretions). Assays might have specimen-specific sensitivities and specificities for detecting viruses, which could lead to heterogeneity in the estimation of virus-specific rates. The sensitivity of using nasopharyngeal washes for detecting any virus in adults was found to be higher than that for using nasopharyngeal swab specimens, which in turn was higher than that for using oropharyngeal swab specimens (84.9%, 73.3%, and 54.2%, respectively) [36]. The limited use (due to ethical concerns and feasibility) of invasive procedures to obtain lower respiratory tract specimens directly from the lung also influenced the diagnosis of viral infection in adults with ARI [37].\nPCR and serology-based diagnostic testing are more sensitive for detecting respiratory viruses than other methods, such as antigen detection and culture. High sensitivity is important for accurate assessment of etiological contribution, particularly in older adults who may have a lower nasopharyngeal viral load and an atypical clinical presentation [7]. Moreover, despite being uncommon, detection of viral coinfection (range across studies, 1%\u201310%) may tend to overstate the contribution of individual respiratory viruses (although dual or multiple infections, in which both or several viruses have etiological importance, are possible). Bacterial coinfections (range across studies, 15%\u201326%) were also reported. With improving diagnostic methods, multiple etiological agents are increasingly identified simultaneously in older adults with ARI, making the individual contribution of each agent difficult to define.\nViruses can be detected in individuals with no respiratory symptoms. This is often seen in volunteer challenge studies and in some community surveys [38, 39]. The detection of viruses in control groups without respiratory symptoms might be due to a nascent infection or a persisting colonization from a previous infection [40]. These factors will tend to result in true associations being attenuated. The fact that molecular detection of viruses in older adults with ARI is higher than the detection rate in controls without respiratory symptoms may not necessarily indicate causation. Alternative explanations should be considered first before causality can be concluded. These include the respiratory viral infection acting as a so-called innocent bystander, without a causal role, and serving only as a predisposing risk factor for ARI. Similarly, the absence of a positive association (and AFE) does not mean that a virus is not a cause of ARI. Moreover, without establishing the temporal sequence of exposure and outcome, determinations of causality are less secure. Therefore, the association between viruses and ARI and pneumonia should be interpreted carefully.\nIn conclusion, this review provides clear evidence that is suggestive of the potentially causal role of RSV, Flu, PIV, hMPV, AdV, RV, and CoV in older adults with ARI and presents the first estimate of the proportion of ARI cases that can be attributed to virus exposure. Etiological studies, which simply report rates of viral identification as causal, should make attempts to interpret findings in terms of the proportion of ARI cases among older adults in whom a respiratory virus is identified that can be attributed to this viral exposure.\nSTUDY GROUP MEMBERS\nThe RESCEU investigators are as follows: Harish Nair, Harry Campbell, Ting Shi, Shanshan Zhang, and You Li (University of Edinburgh); Peter Openshaw and Jadwicha Wedzicha (Imperial College London); Ann Falsey (University of Rochester); Mark Miller (National Institutes of Health\u2013Fogarty); Philippe Beutels (Universiteit Antwerpen); Louis Bont (University Medical Center Utrecht); Andrew Pollard (University of Oxford); Eva Molero (Synapse); Federico Martinon-Torres (Servicio Galego de Saude); Terho Heikkinen (Turku University Central Hospital); Adam Meijer (National Institute for Public Health and the Environment); Thea K\u00f8lsen Fischer (Statens Serum Institut); Maarten van den Berge (Academisch Ziekenhuis Groningen); Carlo Giaquinto (PENTA Foundation); Rafael Mikolajczyk (Martin-Luther University Halle-Wittenberg); Judy Hackett and Eskinder Tafesse (AstraZeneca); Bing Cai and Charles Knirsch (Pfizer); Antonio Gonzalez Lopez, Ilse Dieussaert, Nadia Dermateau, and Sonia Stoszek (GlaxoSmithKline); Scott Gallichan, Alexia Kieffer, and Clarisse Demont (Sanofi Pasteur); Arnaud Cheret, Sandra Gavart, Jeroen Aerssens, Veronique Wyffels, and Matthias Cleenewerck (Janssen); and Robert Fuentes and Brian Rosen (Novavax).\nSupplementary Data\nSupplementary materials are available at The Journal of Infectious Diseases online.

The leading pathogens causing CAP in hospitalized children are respiratory viruses, including influenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and human metapneumovirus; bacterial pathogens such as Streptococcus pneumoniae and Staphylococcus aureus; and the atypical bacterium Mycoplasma pneumoniae. In the prospective Etiology of Pneumonia in the Community (EPIC) study, investigators from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, along with those from children\u2019s hospitals in Nashville, Memphis, and Salt Lake City, determined the etiology of radiographically proven CAP in >2200 hospitalized children from January 2010 through June 2012 [2]. An etiology was proven or implied for 81% of children, using standard microbiologic culture, serologic techniques, and molecular testing. Viral etiologies were primarily implied on the basis of findings from molecular testing of nasopharyngeal specimens, which may or may not reflect the true pathogen causing the lower respiratory tract infection, especially cases due to human rhinovirus. As expected, viral etiologies were most common, with \u22651 virus detected in 66% of patients, whereas typical-bacterial pathogens (primarily S. pneumoniae) were identified in 8%. Evidence of M. pneumoniae infection was found in 8% of patients. Multiple pathogens were detected in 26%, both bacteria and viruses in 7%, and multiple viruses in almost 20%, particularly in children <5 years of age.\nThe interactions of viruses and bacteria in the pathogenesis of both local and invasive respiratory tract infections have been studied for many years. The mechanisms by which preceding influenza virus infections lead to a secondary bacterial infection with S. aureus or S. pneumoniae have been of particular interest [3\u20135]. In this issue of The Journal of Infectious Diseases, Nolan et al [6] examined the EPIC database to further understand the impact of copathogens on the clinical manifestations and outcome of CAP in hospitalized children. As noted above, 26% of children (576 of 2219) had coinfections detected. Of great interest were the 99 children who had \u22651 virus and \u22651 typical bacterium identified. RSV and human rhinovirus were the viruses found most often as single pathogens and were also the viruses most commonly found as copathogens with other viruses or bacteria. S. pneumoniae was codetected with RSV in 11 patients, parainfluenza virus and coronavirus in 8 each, human metapneumovirus in 7, and influenza virus in 4. S. aureus was identified with \u22651 virus in 13 children. M. pneumoniae was a copathogen with \u22651 virus, most commonly human rhinovirus (n = 18), influenza virus (n = 6), and RSV (n = 4), in 48 children. However, demographic and clinical characteristics of children with CAP, including age, underlying conditions, duration of illness prior to admission, prevalence of cough, prevalence of fever, prevalence of chest retractions, and chest radiography findings at admission, were not different between children with typical bacteria alone and those with viral and typical bacterial copathogens or between children with M. pneumoniae alone and those with M. pneumoniae and viral copathogens. Not unexpectedly, children with typical bacteria alone or with viral and typical bacterial copathogens were more likely than children with viruses alone to have a consolidation pattern on their admission chest radiograph or a parapneumonic effusion sometime during hospitalization. There was 1 difference noted for virus-virus coinfections as compared to single-virus infections, with higher rates of supplemental oxygen use in the first 24 hours of hospitalization in the group with virus-virus copathogens. In an earlier study from Dallas, clinical characteristics (pneumonia was most common) were not significantly different among 129 children with invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) with (n = 28) or without (n = 101) a viral coinfection [5].\nFrom a diagnostic standpoint, it is important to know whether the biomarkers associated with CAP in children are modified in infection caused by viral and typical bacterial copathogens as compared to infection due to a typical bacterium alone. In this study, total white blood cell counts and percentages of neutrophils and band forms were almost identical in the group with typical bacteria alone as compared to the group with viral and typical bacterial copathogens, as well as in the group with atypical bacteria (predominantly M. pneumoniae) alone as compared to the group with viral and atypical bacterial copathogens. In another study using the EPIC database and stored residual sera, procalcitonin concentrations were determined in a subset of patients (532 of 1397 [38%]) enrolled at Salt Lake City and Nashville sites [7]. Procalcitonin levels were similar for patients with CAP due to typical bacteria alone (n = 17; median, 2.98 ng/mL; interquartile range [IQR], 0.93\u201312.48 ng/mL), compared with the group with viral and typical bacterial copathogens (n = 37; median, 6.64 ng/mL; IQR, 0.80\u201326.63 ng/mL). However, the authors cautioned that, with typical bacteria detected in only 54 children, their study could not exclude the possibility that viral coinfections could lower procalcitonin concentrations in pediatric CAP due to bacterial-viral coinfection. Viral coinfection also did not change the procalcitonin levels in children with CAP caused by atypical bacteria (n = 24; median, 0.13 ng/mL; IQR, 0.07\u20130.50 ng/mL), compared with those with CAP due to atypical bacterial monoinfection (n = 58; median, 0.09 ng/mL; IQR, 0.06\u20130.21 ng/mL). In the Dallas IPD study, no significant differences were noted for total white blood cell count, percentage of bands, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, or C-reactive protein level between 28 children with viral coinfections and 54 children with negative viral test results [5]. So at least from the published studies to date, a viral coinfection does not appear to significantly affect biomarkers in children with bacterial infection, especially IPD.\nRecently, a novel assay has been described that uses a combination of biomarkers (tumor necrosis factor\u2013related apoptosis-inducing ligand, interferon \u03b3\u2013induced protein 10, and C-reactive protein) to distinguish bacterial from viral infections [8, 9]. The cutoffs for this test include a value above which a bacterial infection is likely, and this includes mixed bacterial and viral infections. In these combined studies, <200 children with lower respiratory tract infections were included. Thus, it would be important to evaluate this new assay in a large prospective study designed like the EPIC study, to ensure that a viral copathogen does not significantly affect the test result in hospitalized children with bacterial CAP.\nWith respect to clinical outcomes, no differences in supplemental oxygen use in the first 24 hours, intensive care admission, invasive mechanical ventilation use, or hospital length of stay were found between children infected with typical bacteria alone as compared to those coinfected with viruses and typical bacteria. Other studies have reported similar results. In the Dallas IPD study, the proportion of children requiring intensive care unit admission or intubation also did not differ between the group with and the group without a viral coinfection, although the authors noted a more severe clinical course in patients with adenovirus coinfection, of whom 2 of 6 died [5]. In an 8-center pediatric pneumococcal surveillance study, 377 patients with pneumococcal pneumonia requiring hospitalization were identified [10]. Of children tested for respiratory viruses, 31 of 46 (67%) with a viral copathogen, compared with 92 of 137 (67%) with negative viral test results, had pneumococcal pneumonia complicated by a large pleural effusion, loculated pleural fluid, parapneumonic empyema, necrotizing pneumonia, or lung abscess.\nIn the pediatric EPIC study, S. aureus was identified in only 22 children; in about half, \u22651 viral copathogen was detected. Because of these small numbers, the authors could not specifically assess the impact of viral coinfection on the outcome of S. aureus pneumonia, which is often associated with necrotizing pneumonia and can be fatal [11, 12]. In a retrospective study from 1 children\u2019s hospital of 117 children with S. aureus pneumonia acquired predominantly in the community between August 2001 and April 2009, viral copathogens were detected in 18 of 68 patients tested (26%); parainfluenza virus (n = 6), influenza virus (n = 5), and rhinovirus (n = 4) were the most common viral copathogens [13]. The children with viral copathogens were more likely to develop respiratory failure and have longer intensive care unit stays than the children without a viral copathogen.\nFor physicians managing hospitalized children, perhaps the most important finding in the study by Nolan et al is that a viral copathogen is present in a large percentage of children with CAP caused by typical bacteria, such as S. pneumoniae and S. aureus, or by atypical bacteria, such as M. pneumoniae. This was also noted in another study on IPD from Dallas, occurring from January 2011 to December 2014, during which 44% of patients underwent viral testing; 60% of those tested were positive for viruses [14]. Thus, detection of a virus in a hospitalized child with CAP by one of the widely available molecular tests for detecting multiple respiratory viruses does not exclude the presence of infection due to typical or atypical bacteria. Nolan et al noted that the clinical manifestations, laboratory and radiographic findings, and outcomes of CAP among children with viral and typical bacterial coinfection were similar to those for children infected with typical bacteria alone and more severe than for patients infected with viruses alone. Furthermore, the analysis by Stockman et al [7] reported significantly higher concentrations of procalcitonin in children with CAP due to viral and typical bacterial coinfection as compared to those with CAP due to viruses alone. Finally, Nolan et al observed no differences in clinical or laboratory findings between children with CAP due to atypical bacteria alone, compared with those with viral and atypical bacterial coinfection. Thus, the interpretation of rapid molecular tests positive for respiratory viruses in hospitalized children with CAP and the decision about whether to initiate antibiotic treatment still require considerable clinical judgment.\nNotes\nPotential conflicts of interest.\u2003S.

The study analyzes data from a birth cohort established as part of the Observational Research in Childhood Infectious Diseases (ORChID) Project, based in Brisbane, Australia [2]. Impressive study attributes include large size, community base, enrollment from birth, scheduled frequent longitudinal sampling with or without illness, high percentage of specimen acquisition rate, even enrollment of subjects throughout the year to account for virus seasonality, and testing of samples with an extensive panel of real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays. Participating babies had anterior nasal and \u201cdirty nappy\u201d swabs obtained at birth and weekly thereafter by parents trained by research staff. Parents also kept daily symptom diaries listing predefined symptoms. The present manuscript reports only on the respiratory swabs. This massive undertaking yielded analyzable data on 9594 samples from 152 participants, corresponding to 163098 individual virus-specific PCR queries!\nThis intensive prospective study of respiratory viruses in infants finds that human rhinovirus (HRV) is by far the most frequent virus detected in the infant respiratory tract. This single-stranded, positive-sense RNA virus is increasingly recognized as an important human pathogen, with a strong relationship to childhood asthma [3]. Significantly, Sarna et al found that HRV was detected in an impressive 20.0% of all samples tested, accounting for 77.3% of all virus-positive swabs. By 2 years of age, 98% of participating infants had experienced HRV-C, 94% HRV-A, and 56% HRV-B. Although impressive, this large proportional load of HRV should not be surprising, as it has also been shown in previous community-based studies using molecular tests, including an earlier study by these authors [4] and several others [5\u20138]. Similarly, laboratories using multiplex respiratory virus panels that include sensitive rhinovirus detection capability usually find rhinovirus/enterovirus to be the most common positive result. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)\u2013cleared multiplex respiratory panels do not distinguish between rhinoviruses and enteroviruses, but apart from outbreak situations, such as occurred in 2014 with enterovirus D-68 [9], most of the positive results from rhinovirus/enterovirus assays reflect HRV infection. It has become clear that in relation to respiratory viruses, HRV is the elephant in the room.\nIn comparison to the universal occurrence of HRV, infections with other respiratory viruses were less frequent. RSV and parainfluenza viruses were each detected in 58% of subjects, influenza A in 8%, influenza B in 3%, human metapneumovirus in 21%, human coronaviruses in 72%, adenovirus in 51%, human polyomaviruses in 77%, and human bocavirus in 75%. The 58% occurrence of RSV is surprisingly low, as common understanding is that almost all infants experience RSV within the first 2 years of life [10]. Possible explanations for the discrepancy include inadequate sample collection (samples were collected by parents), seasonal variation in the occurrence of RSV, and complete reliance on molecular assays. In some studies, serology has indicated some infections are not detected by PCR [11]. The authors point out the difference between their estimate and that of the Houston family study [12], which is a basis for the concept of universal RSV infection early in life and which relied heavily on serology [12]. However, they also cite a number of more recent studies that support their finding of less than universal infection. These results suggest that we may need to fine-tune our understanding of the frequency of RSV infection early in life.\nThe focus of the Sarna et al study was first respiratory virus infections, and the frequency of first HRV infections in young infants is noteworthy. Of the 152 infants followed, 81% experienced a first infection with HRV by 6 months of age, compared to 8.5% for RSV, and 0.7%\u20139.4% for the other respiratory viruses. Influenza A and B infections were infrequent, with only 0.8% and 1.4% experiencing first influenza A and B, respectively, by 6 months of age. The curves mapping virus occurrence by age show that all viruses other than HRV were relatively unusual in the first 6 months of life, with upward inflection points evident at approximately 6 months of age, consistent with diminishing maternal immunity. Notably, the HRV occurrence curve is different, with rapid increase through the first 6 months and no obvious inflection point. The shape of this curve suggests that maternal immunity is not preventing HRV infections, although it is possible that it is mitigating clinical manifestations. This finding has important implications for HRV control strategies, and calls for mechanistic studies to further define the differences between the behavior of HRV and other respiratory viruses.\nWith mounting undeniable evidence for the frequent occurrence of HRV infection in the first 2 years of life, it is important to assess the impact of these infections, and Sarna et al provide relevant data. Based on symptom diaries kept by parents, virus-positive episodes were characterized as symptomatic or asymptomatic and, if symptomatic, as involving the upper or lower respiratory tract. If we direct attention to the episodes in which only a single virus was detected (data shown in Supplementary Table 2 of the Sarna et al manuscript), we see that first HRV detections were less likely than first infections with the other RNA viruses to correspond to symptomatic episodes (52% compared to 70%\u201385% for the other RNA viruses), but were comparably likely compared to the DNA viruses for which 46%\u201359% of first detection episodes corresponded to symptomatic infections. Likewise, only 6% of first HRV infections were classified as lower respiratory infections, compared with 20%\u201346% for the other RNA viruses and 10%\u201315% for the DNA viruses. Only 13% of the first HRV detections were associated with a medical visit, compared with 25%\u201342% for the other RNA viruses and 8%\u201328% for the DNA viruses. It should be noted that direct comparison of severity of HRV infections to the other respiratory viruses is complicated by the fact that a much higher proportion of first episode HRV infections occurred in infants <6 months of age, and data are not provided (and may not have been available because of the infrequency of infection with the non-HRV respiratory viruses during that age period) that allow us to ascertain whether an age effect is present. Nevertheless, it is clear that most of the first HRV infections were mild, in spite of the fact that they were occurring predominantly in infants <6 months of age, an age when the immune system is not fully developed and some viral infections can disseminate.\nHowever, as the authors correctly point out, the mildness of the clinical illness associated with first HRV detections may not be the whole story. They cite a recent study by Wolsk et al [13] showing that HRV infection in the first 4 weeks of life, even if asymptomatic, may program immune memory with an exaggerated T-helper 2 mucosal immune response and impaired antiviral responses. The implication is that HRV infection in young infants, even if asymptomatic, might promote the development of asthma later in life. This interaction may be viewed as HRV serving as an educator (or miseducator) of the immune system by virtue of early-in-life virus\u2013host interactions. This concept fits well with an emerging view that one of the key functions of the infant\u2019s microbiome is education of the immune system [14]. The ORChID study has made an important contribution by directing our attention to the extremely frequent interaction between HRV and the immature immune system, the implications of which clearly merit further study.\nSupplementary Data\nSupplementary materials are available at The Journal of Infectious Diseases online.

Transcriptional profiling is a promising tool for improving diagnosis in LRTI.\nMethods.\u2003We performed whole blood transcriptional analysis in 118 patients (median age [interquartile range], 61 [50\u201376] years) hospitalized with LRTI and 40 age-matched healthy controls (median age, 60 [46\u201370] years). We applied class comparisons, modular analysis, and class prediction algorithms to identify and validate diagnostic biosignatures for bacterial and viral LRTI.\nResults.\u2003Patients were classified as having bacterial (n = 22), viral (n = 71), or bacterial-viral LRTI (n = 25) based on comprehensive microbiologic testing. Compared with healthy controls, statistical group comparisons (P < .01; multiple-test corrections) identified 3376 differentially expressed genes in patients with bacterial LRTI, 2391 in viral LRTI, and 2628 in bacterial-viral LRTI. Patients with bacterial LRTI showed significant overexpression of inflammation and neutrophil genes (bacterial > bacterial-viral > viral), and those with viral LRTI displayed significantly greater overexpression of interferon genes (viral > bacterial-viral > bacterial). The K\u2013nearest neighbors algorithm identified 10 classifier genes that discriminated between bacterial and viral LRTI with a 95% sensitivity (95% confidence interval, 77%\u2013100%) and 92% specificity (77%\u201398%), compared with a sensitivity of 38% (18%\u201362%) and a specificity of 91% (76%\u201398%) for procalcitonin.\nConclusions.\u2003Transcriptional profiling is a helpful tool for diagnosis of LRTI.\nmicroarrays, lower respiratory tract infection, procalcitonin, viral infections, bacterial infections\nTopic: transcription, genetic adult genes diagnosis lower respiratory tract infections procalcitonin\nIssue Section: Pathogenesis and Host Response\n(See the editorial commentary by Tsalik, McClain, and Zaas on pages 173\u20135.)\nLower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs) are among the most frequent reasons for hospitalization in adults. However, the spectrum of the disease is broad, and adult patients with LRTI can present with a minor self-limiting illness to potentially life-threatening disease [1, 2]. Until recently, bacterial pathogens were considered the leading cause of LRTI/pneumonia in adults. However, there is increasing evidence suggesting that viral respiratory infections also play an important role [3, 4]. Antibiotic resistance, the increased adverse drug reactions and the costs of antimicrobial therapy should be considered in order to implement a rational use of antimicrobials. Hence, elucidating the causes of LRTIs has become a pivotal factor for improving patient management.\nTo tackle this issue, in recent years there has been increased interest in the development of rapid and accurate diagnostic tests for detection of respiratory pathogens (eg, polymerase chain reaction [PCR]) [5] and biomarkers with potential ability to distinguish between viral and bacterial infections, such as procalcitonin (PCT) [6] and C-reactive protein [7]. However, these tools have limitations, especially for the diagnosis of bacterial pathogens. Thus, there is an urgent need for the development of new methods to accurately differentiate viral from bacterial LRTIs to allow targeted use of antimicrobial therapy.\nTranscriptional analysis is a promising tool that allows a comprehensive and efficient analysis of a large number of genes and helps elucidate the host response to the disease [8]. This approach has been applied to patients with different infectious diseases and has successfully demonstrated the potential to differentiate bacterial and viral infections, mainly in the pediatric population [9\u201311]. Moreover, recent studies have also demonstrated the value of this approach as a prognostic tool [10, 12]. Fewer studies have evaluated the role of microarrays for the diagnosis of bacterial and viral LRTI in adults [12\u201314].\nThe purpose of this study was to explore the value of transcriptional profiling as a potential diagnostic tool in adults hospitalized with LRTIs. Specifically, our focus was to evaluate the application of transcriptional profiles in the differential diagnosis of bacterial and viral LRTIs in adults.\nPATIENTS, MATERIALS, AND METHODS\nStudy Design and Patients\nWe conducted a prospective study in adult patients (aged \u226521 years) hospitalized with LRTI over 3 respiratory seasons (2008\u20132011). All patients were enrolled at Rochester General Hospital, New York, and screened for bacteria and respiratory viruses with a comprehensive microbiologic diagnostic algorithm, as described elsewhere [15]. Exclusion criteria included antibiotic treatment before admission, immunosuppression, cavitary lung disease, and witnessed aspiration. Informed consent was obtained from subjects before sample collection. At enrollment, demographic, clinical, and laboratory information was collected, and a pulmonary specialist assigned the admitting diagnosis after examination of each patient and review of laboratory and radiographic data [15].\nBlood samples were obtained for microarray analyses and white blood cell counts with differential, and PCT concentrations were measured in all study patients using a time-resolved amplified cryptate emission technology assay (Kryptor PCT; Brahms). The functional sensitivity of the assay is 0.06 ng/mL [16]. Blood samples were also obtained from 40 healthy volunteers matched for age, race, and sex, and screened for respiratory illnesses, as reference controls (Supplementary Figure 2). The study was approved by the institutional review boards at Rochester General Hospital, the University of Rochester, and Nationwide Children's Hospital.\nSpecimen Collection and Microbiologic Methods\nNasopharyngeal, sputum, urine, and blood samples were obtained at admission for bacterial and viral detection and were processed at Rochester General Hospital clinical laboratory, as described elsewhere [15]. Briefly, respiratory viruses were identified by a combination of PCR, culture, and serology, and bacterial pathogens were identified by culture, serology, and antigen detection. To identify respiratory viruses, we used PCR for influenza A and B viruses, respiratory syncytial virus [RSV], human metapneumovirus [HMPV], parainfluenza virus [PIV] types 1\u20133, human rhinovirus [HRV], and coronavirus 229E and OC43; viral culture for influenza, RSV, PIV, HRV, adenovirus, and enterovirus; and acute and convalescent serum immunoglobulin G titers for influenza, RSV, HMPV, PIV, HRV, and coronavirus 229E and OC43. Bacterial pathogens were identified with Gram staining and semiquantitative bacterial cultures from sputum and blood samples as well as nasopharyngeal and throat PCR for Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Chlamydophila pneumoniae. In addition, urinary antigen testing was also performed for Streptococcus pneumoniae and Legionella pneumoniae. Finally, pneumococcal surface protein A antigens covering families 1 and 2 were used for pneumococcal serology.\nMicroarray Data and Statistical Analysis\nBlood samples (1\u20133 mL) for microarray analyses were collected in Tempus tubes (Applied Biosystems) and stored at \u221220\u00b0C. Whole blood RNA was processed and hybridized into Illumina Human HT-12 v4 BeadChip kit (47 323 probes) and scanned on the Illumina BeadStation 500 [12, 17]. Illumina GenomeStudio software was used to subtract background and scale average samples' signal intensity, and GeneSpring GX 7.3 (Agilent Technologies) software to perform further normalization and analyses [9, 12, 18]. Briefly, transcripts were first selected if they were present in \u226510% of all samples and had a minimum of 2-fold expression change compared with the median intensity across all samples. Using this approach, we obtained a total of 16 710 quality control transcripts (Supplementary Figure 1A; 158 samples [22 bacterial LRTI, 71 viral LRTI, 25 bacterial-viral coinfections, and 40 healthy controls]).\nWe then continued with the following strategy. First, we performed supervised analysis (comparative analyses between predefined sample groups) using the Mann\u2013Whitney test (P < .01), followed by Benjamini\u2013Hochberg multiple-test corrections and a \u22651.25 fold change in expression level relative to the control group [10, 12]. Next, we applied unsupervised clustering (unbiased grouping of samples based on their transcriptional profile without prior knowledge of sample classification) to the validation set. We then applied class prediction, using the K\u2013nearest neighbors (K-NN) algorithm, with 12 neighbors and a P value ratio cutoff of .5, to identify the top-ranked genes that best discriminated between bacterial and viral infections [9]. Finally, we performed functional gene analyses using a modular analysis, as described elsewhere [17, 19, 20] (module transcript content and annotations are available online at http://www.biir.net/public_wikis/module_annotation/V2_Trial_8_Modules). The data are deposited in the National Center for Biotechnology Information Gene Expression Omnibus (accession No. GSE6024).\nPatient demographic and clinical characteristics were compared using \u03c72 or Fisher exact tests, whenever appropriate. Normally distributed continuous variables were compared using t tests or 1-way analysis of variance, and results were expressed as means and standard deviations. Nonnormally distributed continuous variables were compared using Mann\u2013Whitney or Kruskal\u2013Wallis tests (for 2 or >2 groups, respectively), and results were expressed as medians and interquartile ranges. Differences were considered significant at P < .05 for all statistical analyses. The IBM SPSS software package, version 19.0 (IBM), and GraphPad Prism version 6.03 for Windows (GraphPad Software), were used to perform statistical analyses.\nRESULTS\nPatient Demographic Characteristics and Etiologic Diagnosis\nDuring the study period, 118 patients and 40 healthy controls (matched for age, sex, and race) were enrolled. Patients' median age was 61 years (interquartile range, 50\u201376 years), 69 (58.4%) were female, and the majority were white (76.3%). The most common clinical presentation was chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation (34 episodes; 28.8%), followed by community-acquired pneumonia (32 episodes; 27.1%). The most common presenting symptoms were cough (97.4%) and dyspnea (94%). None of the patients enrolled died during the study period. The remaining clinical characteristics of the patients with LRTI and the control group are summarized in Table 1 and Supplementary Table 1.\nTable 1.\nDemographic, Clinical, Radiologic, and Laboratory Data for Enrolled Patients With LRTIa\nPatient Characteristics Total (n = 118) Viral LRTI (n = 71) Bacterial LRTI (n = 22) Bacterial-Viral LRTI (n = 25) P Value Missing Values, No. of Patients\nAge, median (IQR), y  62 (50\u201376)  61 (50\u201377)  67 (46\u201376)  60 (51\u201372)  .95  0 \nMale sex  49 (41.5)  27 (38.0)  10 (45.5)  12 (48.0)  .63  0 \nRace             \nWhite  90 (76.3)  59 (83.1)  14 (63.6)  17 (68.0)  .19  0 \nBlack  26 (22.0)  11 (15.5)  8 (36.4)  7 (28.0)  0 \nAsian  2 (1.7)  1 (1.4)  0 (0.0)  1 (4.0)  0 \nResidence            3 \nHome  107 (93.0)  63 (92.6)  21 (95.5)  23  .54  \u2026 \nAssisted living  4 (3.5)  3 (4.4)  1 (4.5)  0 (0.0)    \u2026 \nNursing home  4 (3.5)  2 (2.9)  0 (0.0)  2 (8.0)    \u2026 \nUnderlying conditions             \nChronic sinus disease  13 (11.4)  7 (10.4)  4 (18.2)  2 (8.0)  .51  4 \nDiabetes mellitus  43 (36.4)  27 (38)  8 (36.4)  8 (32)  .86  0 \nCHF  20 (16.9)  13 (18.3)  3 (13.6)  4 (16.0)  .87  0 \nCOPD  47 (39.8)  25 (35.2)  11 (50.0)  11 (44.0)  .41  0 \nCRF  1 (0.8)  0 (0.0)  0 (0.0)  1 (4.0)  .16  1 \nBMI, median (IQR)  27.8 (22.8\u201336.5)  28.1 (22.8\u201337.4)  27.8 (22.5\u201337.5)  27.3 (23.3\u201334.3)  .89  27 \nUnderweight  4 (4.4)  1 (1.9)  2 (10.5)  1 (4.8)  .84  NA \nHealthy weight  31 (34.1)  18 (35.3)  5 (26.3)  7 (38.1)  NA \nOverweight  18 (19.8)  10 (19.6)  4 (21.8)  4 (19.0)  NA \nObese  38 (41.7)  22 (43.1)  8 (42.1)  8 (38.1)  NA \nRisk factors             \nSmoking (active)  45 (38.1)  23 (32.4)  9 (40.9)  13 (52.0)  .21  0 \nOral steroids  14 (11.9)  9 (12.9)  2 (9.1)  3 (12.0)  .89  1 \nInhaled steroids  50 (42.4)  21 (29.6)  15 (68.2)  14 (56.0)  .002b  0 \nNSAIDs  22 (18.6)  14 (19.7)  4 (18.2)  4 (16.0)  .92  0 \nHome oxygen  24 (20.3)  14 (19.7)  8 (36.4)  2 (8.0)  .054  0 \nInfluenza vaccine  72 (63.7)  43 (64.2)  17 (81.0)  12 (48)  .07  5 \nPneumococcal vaccine  57 (58.2)  33 (60.0)  14 (70.0)  10 (43.5)  .20  3 \nClinical diagnosis             \nPneumonia  32 (27.1)  12 (16.9)  11 (50.0)  9 (36.0)  .07  0 \nCOPD exacerbation  34 (28.8)  22 (31.0)  6 (27.3)  6 (24.0)  0 \nAsthma  20 (16.9)  13 (18.3)  2 (9.1)  5 (20.0)  0 \nCHF  8 (6.8)  6 (8.5)  2 (9.1)  0 (0.0)  0 \nBronchitis  15 (12.7)  13 (18.3)  0 (0.0)  2 (8.0)  0 \nOtherc  9 (7.6)  5 (7.0)  1 (4.5)  3 (12.0)  0 \nClinical manifestations             \nCongestion  68 (57.6)  47 (66.2)  8 (36.4)  13 (52.0)  .03b  0 \nCough  115 (97.5)  71 (100.0)  20 (90.9)  24 (96.0)  .05  0 \nPurulent sputum  75 (66.4)  42 (63.6)  14 (63.6)  19 (76.0)  .51  5 \nDyspnea  111 (94.1)  66 (93.0)  22 (100.0)  23 (92.0)  .42  0 \nWheezing  75 (63.5)  49 (69.0)  12 (54.5)  14 (56.0)  .32  0 \nConfusion  14 (12.3)  8 (11.9)  3 (13.6)  3 (12.0)  .98  4 \nChest radiographic findings             \nNormal  50 (42.7)  32 (45.7)  6 (27.3)  12 (48.0)  .23  1 \nAtelectasis  33 (28.2)  22 (31.4)  6 (27.3)  5 (20.0)  .55  1 \nInfiltrate, no consolidation  49 (41.8)  27 (38.6)  10 (45.5)  12 (48.0)  .66  1 \nConsolidation  6 (5.1)  2 (2.9)  3 (13.6)  1 (4.0)  .13  1 \nEdema  18 (15.3)  10 (14.3)  5 (22.7)  3 (12.0)  .55  1 \nPleural effusion  7 (6.0)  2 (2.9)  4 (18.2)  1 (4.0)  .03b  1 \nCT scan pattern             \nNormal  5 (27.7)  5 (50.0)  0 (0.0)  0 (0.0)  .06  100 \nAtelectasis  5 (27.7)  3 (30.0)  2 (33.3)  0 (0.0)  .64  100 \nInfiltrate, no consolidation  8 (44.4)  2 (20.0)  5 (83.3)  1 (50.0)  .047b  100 \nConsolidation  2 (11.1)  1 (10.0)  1 (16.7)  0 (0.0)  .80  100 \nLaboratory parameters             \nWBC count, median (IQR), \u00d7103/mL  10.0 (7.15\u201314.7)  8.6 (6.6\u201311.4)  12.9 (9.2\u201317.5)  13.1 (8.8\u201317.5)  <.001b  5 \nLeukocytosisd  40 (60.6)  13 (19.7)  12 (54.5)  15 (60.0)  <.001b  5 \nLeukopeniae  2 (3.0)  1 (1.5)  1 (4.5)  0 (0.0)  .48  5 \nNeutrophils median (IQR), %  73.0 (66.0\u201383.0)  72.5 (65.2\u201381.2)  80.0 (68.2\u201386.2)  71.0 (65.0\u201382.0)  .07  15 \nBand neutrophils, median (IQR), %  1.0 (0.0\u20136.0)  0.0 (0.0\u20135.0)  0.0 (0.0\u20133.7)  6.0 (0.0\u201314.0)  .02b  23 \nPlatelet count, median (IQR), \u00d7103/mL  228.0 (180.5\u2013287.5)  217.0 (164.0\u2013253.0)  268.0 (190.5\u2013326.2)  231.0 (206.5\u2013302.0)  .08  5 \nSerum urea nitrogen, median (IQR), mg/dL  17.5 (11.0\u201324.0)  18.0 (11.7\u201324.2)  16.0 (11.0\u201322.5)  17.5 (10.2\u201324.0)  .98  6 \nPCT, median (IQR), ng/mLf  0.13 (0.08\u20130.34)  0.11 (0.08\u20130.19)  0.13 (0.05\u20131.17)  0.67 (0.16\u20132.89)  <.001b  5 \nAbbreviations: BMI, body mass index;

Of the 71 viral infections, 32 (45%) were caused by influenza A, 9 (12.7%) by influenza B, 17 (23.9%) by RSV, and 7 (9.9%) by HMPV, and 6 (8.4%) were viral-viral coinfections. Among the bacterial infections, we identified 13 Streptococcus pneumoniae, 2 Staphylococcus aureus, 4 Moraxella catarrhalis, and 3 bacterial-bacterial coinfections.\nRobust Transcriptional Biosignature in Adults Hospitalized With LRTI\nWe obtained blood samples from the 118 patients (including bacterial, viral, and bacterial-viral coinfections) and 40 healthy controls to define the whole blood biosignature of LRTI in adults (Supplementary Table 2). Samples were randomly divided into 2 independent cohorts (\u201ctraining\u201d and \u201ctest\u201d sets). We used the training set to identify the transcriptional signature of LRTI and then validated it in the test set. Statistical group comparisons between the training set of 59 patients with LRTI and 20 healthy controls, matched for age, sex, and race, yielded 3986 differentially expressed transcripts (Figure 1A). This signature was validated in the independent test set of 59 patients and 20 healthy controls, also matched for age, sex and race. Hierarchical clustering of the test set samples confirmed the consistency of the gene expression patterns and correctly grouped 53 (90%) of 59 patients with LRTI (Figure 1B).\nFigure 1.\nOpen in new tabDownload slide\nLower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) whole blood transcriptional signature.

Abbreviation: NK, natural killer.\nTo better understand the host response in adults with LRTI and the immune pathways activated or suppressed, we used an analytical framework of 62 transcriptional modules that group together genes with shared expression patterns and similar biologic functions [19]. Module maps were derived independently for the training (Figure 1C) and test sets (Figure 1D), using their respective healthy control groups as references. Overall, patients with LRTI demonstrated significant overexpression of modules linked to the innate immune response (inflammation [M4.6, M5.1, and M5.7], interferon [IFN; M1.2, M3.4 and M5.12], and neutrophils [M5.15]) and underexpression of modules linked to the adaptive immune response (T cells [M4.1 and M4.15], B cells [M4.10], and lymphoid lineage [M6.19]). These findings were validated in the test set, as demonstrated by a significant correlation between training and test sets (Figure 1F; P < .001; Spearman r = 0.98), confirming the robustness of these observations.\nDistinct Transcriptional Profiles in Patients With Bacterial, Viral, and Bacterial-Viral LRTIs\nNext, to define the specific transcriptional profiles induced by viral or bacterial pathogens, we analyzed separately the gene expression profiles from 22 patients with bacterial infections, 71 with viral infections, and 25 with bacterial-viral coinfections, using 18 age-, sex-, and race-matched healthy controls as reference. Statistical group comparisons between the bacterial LRTI group and healthy controls identified 3376 differentially expressed transcripts. A similar approach revealed 2391 transcripts differentially expressed between viral LRTI and controls and 2628 between patients with bacterial-viral coinfections and controls. A hierarchical clustering algorithm was applied to the 3 patient cohorts to visualize the transcriptional pattern (Figure 2A\u2013C). There were 1222 transcripts shared among the 3 groups. They represented 36% of transcripts for the bacterial LRTI signature, 51% of the viral LRTI signature, and 47% of the bacterial-viral coinfection signature. Likewise, a significant number of transcripts were specific for each of the groups (Figure 2D).\nFigure 2.\nOpen in new tabDownload slide\nTranscriptional profiles in patients with bacterial, viral, and bacterial-viral (coinfection) lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI). Heat maps represent the transcriptional profiles of 18 healthy controls and 22 patients with a bacterial LRTI based on 3376 transcripts (A); 18 healthy controls and 71 patients with a viral LRTI based on 2391 transcripts (B), and 18 healthy controls and 25 patients with a bacterial-viral LRTI based on 2628 transcripts (C). All transcripts were identified after applying a nonparametric test (Mann\u2013Whitney) (P < .01), 1.25-fold change, and Benjamini\u2013Hochberg multiple-test correction. D, Venn diagram displaying the overlap among the significant transcripts identified in the 3 LRTI groups.\nTo better characterize the biologic significance of the differences in gene expression profiles identified in the 3 groups, we performed modular analysis [19]. Patients with bacterial LRTI demonstrated significant overexpression of modules related to the innate immune response, including inflammation and neutrophils modules, and underexpression of genes regulating the adaptive immunity, such as B- and T-cell modules, as did the viral infection group. However, the latter presented a marked overexpression of the IFN-related modules, which was absent in the bacterial infection group (Figure 3). Furthermore, the plasma cells module was only overexpressed in the viral infection group. For those modules that presented the same trend in the level of expression, we also found differences in magnitude, as was the case with neutrophils (more overexpressed in the bacterial infection group; P < .001) and natural killer cells (more underexpressed in the bacterial infection group; P < .001) modules (Figure 3 and Supplementary Figure 1B). The module based analysis also showed a distinct pattern for the bacterial-viral coinfection group, characterized by relative underexpression of the platelets and monocytes modules (Figure 3) and intermediate expression of inflammation and IFN-related modules compared with the bacterial and viral infection groups (Supplementary Figure 1B).\nFigure 3.\nOpen in new tabDownload slide\nModular transcriptional fingerprint comparison among the 3 lower respiratory tract infection groups.

To perform this analysis, we divided patients with bacterial and viral LRTI into 2 independent cohorts (K-NN training set and test set), each comprising 11 patients with bacterial and 12 with viral LRTI. The K-NN algorithm identified 10 classifier genes that best discriminated bacterial from viral LRTI (Table 2). Eight of those 10 classifiers were IFN-related genes (IFI44, IFIT3, IFI27, RSAD2, OAS2, OASL, IFIT2, and PARP9). Using the 10 classifier genes, leave-one-out cross-validation of the training set correctly classified 21 of 23 samples (91% accuracy; Figure 4A). In the validation analysis (K-NN in the test set), the classifier genes correctly categorized 22 of 23 new patient samples (96% accuracy; Figure 4B). To further confirm these findings, using the 10 classifier genes, we applied an unsupervised hierarchical clustering algorithm to a third cohort of patients comprising the 11 patients with bacterial LRTI used in the K-NN training set and a new independent set of 12 patients with viral LRTI. In this analysis, 22 of 23 patients (96%) were correctly classified (Figure 4C).\nTable 2.\nClassifier Genes That Best Discriminate Bacterial From Viral LRTIa\nGene Bacterial LRTI Viral LRTI\nBTN3A3  0.40  1.21 \nIFI27  2.16  57.49 \nRSAD2  0.73  14.24 \nKIAA1618  0.86  2.73 \nOAS2  0.85  3.51 \nIFIT3  0.64  4.35 \nIFI44  0.83  9.17 \nOASL  1.11  5.22 \nIFIT2  0.86  2.56 \nPARP9  1.35  2.62 \nAbbreviation: LRTI, lower respiratory tract infection.\na Numeric values represent median expression values per transcript per study group.

The combined sensitivity of the 10 classifier genes derived from the 3 cohorts of patients analyzed was 95% (95% confidence interval [CI], 77%\u2013100%) with a specificity of 92% (77%\u201398%) (Table 3). Following Schuetz et al [21], a serum PCT concentration of \u22650.25 ng/mL, measured within the first 48 hours of hospitalization, is considered indicative of possible bacterial infection. This PCT cutoff value was applied to the same patient cohorts that were included in the K-NN analysis and demonstrated a sensitivity of 38% (95% CI, 18%\u201362%) and a specificity of 91% (76%\u201398%) (Table 3). Even after we included all the patients with bacterial and viral infection who had PCT concentrations measured (n = 88), the sensitivity and specificity did not improve (sensitivity, 36% [95% CI, 17%\u201359%]; specificity, 80% [69%\u201389%]).\nTable 3.\nComparative Sensitivity and Specificity of PCT and Classifier Genes to Discriminate Between Viral and Bacterial LRTI\nMethod Correct, No. (%) Incorrect, No. (%) Sensitivity (95% CI), % Specificity (95% CI), %\nPCT (n = 55)         \nBacterial  8 (38.1)  13 (61.9)  38 (18\u201362)  91 (76\u201398) \nViral  31 (91.2)  3 (8.8)     \nTotal  39 (70.9)  16 (29.1%)     \nClassifier genes (n = 58) \nBacterial  21 (95.5)  1 (4.5)  95 (77\u2013100)  92 (77\u201398) \nViral  33 (91.7)  3 (8.3)     \nTotal  54 (93.1)  4 (6.9)     \nAbbreviations: CI, confidence interval; LRTI, lower respiratory tract infection; PCT, procalcitonin.\nOpen in new tab\nDISCUSSION\nThis study was designed to evaluate the applicability of transcriptional profiling as a diagnostic tool in adults hospitalized with LRTI. Using an objective analytical approach, we found that the systemic response in patients with LRTI displays a robust and reproducible biosignature, with specific characteristics depending on the causative pathogen. Using these biosignatures and applying strict statistical analyses, we demonstrated that virus and bacterial infections can be differentiated with high sensitivity and specificity at the host response level.\nLRTIs are a frequent cause of hospitalization and a major reason for treatment with antibiotics worldwide. The role of respiratory viruses in LRTIs in older adults is increasingly recognized, suggesting that accurate diagnostic tests to identify the etiologic mechanism of LRTIs have the potential to reduce overall antibiotic use. Our results showed that a distinct systemic host response is elicited in each infection group (ie, bacterial vs viral) and can be detected in the blood and at an early stage of the disease, as reported elsewhere for children [9, 10, 17, 22]. In agreement with other studies using gene expression analyses in patients with respiratory viral infections [10, 23], we observed that the major difference between the groups was found in the IFN response, with the viral infection group showing the highest expression level. Indeed, the 10 transcripts identified with the K-NN algorithm as the best classifiers included 8 IFN-related genes, allowing us to categorize patients with bacterial versus viral LRTI with high sensitivity (95%) and specificity (92%).\nDifferent biomarkers to help differentiate bacterial from viral infections have been evaluated in adults with LRTI, with conflicting results [24]. C-reactive protein was considered a useful tool to distinguish bacterial from viral infections [7], but studies have shown [25] that this biomarker lacks sufficient sensitivity and specificity. In addition, although there are promising results supporting the applicability of PCT as a prognostic biomarker, its value as a diagnostic tool is still under debate. Its diagnostic accuracy in LRTI is variable and depends on the cutoff values used and the conditions under study, such as community-acquired pneumonia, acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or bronchitis [26]. Our results indicate that the 10 classifier genes have superior sensitivity and similar specificity compared with serum PCT, demonstrating the potential value of transcriptional profiling as a diagnostic tool to differentiate viral from bacterial LRTI in the adult population. Importantly, these findings are in agreement with the Infectious Diseases Society of America/American Thoracic Society recommendations for improvement in the diagnosis of LRTI, because the symptoms of bacterial community-acquired pneumonia overlap with viral causes of pneumonia as well as exacerbations of asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [27].\nOur study has limitations. The biosignatures were obtained from hospitalized patients who represent the most severe forms of LRTI. Nevertheless, it serves as the initial basis for future studies including patients with less severe infections who are managed as outpatients. Profiles were derived from peripheral whole blood and not from the respiratory mucosa, which may not necessarily reflect what is occurring in the primary site of infection. However, studies have demonstrated the value of whole blood transcriptional profiles in other patient cohorts with respiratory infections [10, 12\u201314]. In addition, blood samples are convenient samples for diagnostic and prognostic analysis, because they are routinely obtained from patients with LRTI and do not require additional, more invasive interventions. Our results were obtained from a single cohort of 118 patients with LRTI hospitalized in a single center. It would be necessary to validate our findings in independent cohorts. Although we attempted to identify a biosignature in those patients with documented bacterial-viral coinfections, the small number of patients and the heterogeneity of the viruses and bacteria identified did not allow us yet to identify transcripts that can separate them from the other 2 groups. This important subgroup will require further studies using a larger sample.\nIn conclusion, this study provides evidence of the applicability of transcriptional profiling obtained from a single blood sample for diagnosis of viral versus bacterial LRTIs in adults within 24 hours of hospitalization. Indeed, there are ongoing studies applying PCR-based platforms to advance the implementation of host transcriptional profiles in the clinical setting [13]. In addition, our study demonstrates that with appropriate bioinformatics resources, vast amount of expression data can be simplified to obtain practical biomarkers as currently demanded by clinicians.\nNotes\nAcknowledgments.\u2003We thank the staff of the Rochester General Hospital clinical microbiology, hematology, and chemistry laboratory for assistance with specimen retrieval, members of the respiratory therapy department for help with sputum induction, and Kenneth Becker and Eric Nylen for PCT measurements.

We conducted a systematic review and exploratory meta-analysis to assess the overall evidence.\nMethods.\u2003Healthcare databases and sources of grey literature were searched in July 2013.

Narrative analyses revealed consistent evidence for a reduction in mortality, especially when convalescent plasma is administered early after symptom onset. Exploratory post hoc meta-analysis showed a statistically significant reduction in the pooled odds of mortality following treatment, compared with placebo or no therapy (odds ratio, 0.25; 95% confidence interval, .14\u2013.45; I2 = 0%). Studies were commonly of low or very low quality, lacked control groups, and at moderate or high risk of bias. Sources of clinical and methodological heterogeneity were identified.\nConclusions.\u2003Convalescent plasma may reduce mortality and appears safe. This therapy should be studied within the context of a well-designed clinical trial or other formal evaluation, including for treatment of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus CoV infection.\nMERS coronavirus, convalescent plasma, severe acute respiratory infection, systematic review, meta-analysis\nTopic: heterogeneity plasma respiratory tract infections immunoglobulins infections influenzavirus a mortality sars coronavirus influenza a virus, h1n1 subtype swine influenza swine-origin influenza virus causality symptom onset middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus\nIssue Section: Viruses\nAs of 23 May 2014, the World Health Organization (WHO) had been informed of 635 persons with laboratory-confirmed Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection, of whom 193 (30%) have died [1]. The current approach to clinical management of MERS-CoV infection centers on general supportive care, with provision of critical care and organ support when necessary [2]. It has recently been suggested that administration of convalescent plasma or hyperimmune immunoglobulin will yield a clinical effect for treatment of MERS-CoV infection [3]. However, numerous uncertainties remain because the clinical course, viral replication kinetics, and host interactions are yet to be fully established [4]. Furthermore, the underlying evidence is based on studies of varying size and quality that describe clinical experience in treating other viral infections, including those due to SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Spanish influenza A(H1N1), avian influenza A(H5N1), and 2009 pandemic influenza A(H1N1) (hereafter, \u201cinfluenza A[H1N1]pdm09\u201d) [5\u20139].\nWe conducted a systematic review and exploratory meta-analysis to evaluate the clinical effectiveness of convalescent plasma, serum, or hyperimmune immunoglobulin for the treatment of severe acute respiratory infections (SARIs) of viral etiology, to help inform clinical management of MERS-CoV infection.\nMETHODS\nThis systematic review was conducted in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines [10]. The study protocol was registered with the National Institute for Health Research international prospective register of systematic reviews [11].\nThe study eligibility criteria are available elsewhere [11]. Briefly, the study population of interest was human subjects of any age or sex who were hospitalized with SARIs with a laboratory-confirmed or suspected viral etiology. The intervention of interest was convalescent plasma, serum, or hyperimmune immunoglobulin derived from convalescent plasma. Comparator treatments included placebo, sham therapy, or no intervention; studies with no comparator group were also included. Outcome measures were derived from the protocol research questions to ascertain the clinical effectiveness of therapy [11].\nSearch Strategy and Study Selection\nTwo reviewers (J. M.-J. and M. S.-C.) executed the search strategy in July 2013. The sources of information searched and search construct are available elsewhere [11]. Adaptations were made for search interfaces that did not allow use of complex constructs. All search records were imported to EndNote X5 software (Thomson Reuters, San Francisco, CA) or screened manually, using paper records. Following the removal of duplicate entries, a 3-stage screening process was followed to identify eligible records through the sequential examination of each title, abstract, and full text. Two reviewers (J. M.-J. and M. S.-C.) screened each record, with provision for arbitration from a third reviewer (C. R. B.).\nData Collection\nData were collected independently by paired reviewers, using a piloted form. Consensus agreement for each extracted data item was reached by discussion, with provision for arbitration from a third reviewer (J. M.-J., M. S.-C., and C. R. B.). The data extraction form is available as an appendix to the study protocol [11].\nRisk of Bias Within Studies\nRisk of bias assessments were performed at the outcome measure level during data collection. The Cochrane Collaboration tool was used for experimental and prospective cohort studies [12], the Newcastle-Ottawa scale was used for observational studies (excluding prospective cohort studies) [13], and a tool published by the US Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality was used for systematic reviews [14]. Records limited to abstracts were not assessed, because of the paucity of information contained therein.\nSummary Measures and Synthesis of Results\nOdds ratios (ORs), case-fatality rates (CFRs), absolute differences in CFRs, and difference in means were calculated as summary statistics with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Study characteristics and outcome measures were tabulated. A recognized framework for narrative synthesis was adopted [15]. Because of potential concerns with clinical heterogeneity, analyses were stratified by viral etiology for each research question in accordance with the protocol [11].\nAn exploratory, post hoc, random-effects-model meta-analysis was conducted to describe the pooled OR of mortality, irrespective of SARI etiology, following treatment with convalescent plasma or serum, using the odds after receipt of placebo or no therapy as a reference. Results were adjusted by adding 0.5 to each cell of the contingency table when no deaths occurred in the exposed group in individual studies [12]. Meta-analysis of crude CFRs, using a random-effects model, was undertaken. Statistical heterogeneity was ascertained using the I2 statistic, and meta-analyses were abandoned when this reached 85% [16]. Sensitivity analyses were undertaken to investigate the impact of excluding studies with \u22645 patients in the exposed group. Publication bias was assessed through construction of funnel plots and by use of the Egger test.\nAll statistical analyses were conducted using Stata software, version 12.1 (StataCorp, College Station, TX), except for meta-analysis of pooled proportions, for which we used StatsDirect software, version 2.8.0 (StatsDirect, Altrincham, United Kingdom). Statistical significance was assumed at the 5% level.\nRESULTS\nStudy Selection\nThe search process yielded 3406 records (Figure 1). After sifting 1449 unique records against the protocol eligibility criteria, we identified 32 studies from 50 reports (Supplementary Table 1). Three studies could not be obtained [17\u201319], although results from a study by Bass et al [17] were reported elsewhere [20], which enabled their inclusion. French (n = 1), German (n = 2), and Korean (n = 2) records were screened by single reviewers because of a lack of multilingual collaborators.\nFigure 1.\nOpen in new tabDownload slide\nPreferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses diagram. aRecords were rejected for the following reasons: not population of interest, 12 records (1 in French, 1 in German, 1 in Italian, and 1 in Korean); no intervention of interest, 15 (1 in German); not suitable comparator, 1; nonhuman study, 1; and no outcome of interest, 7.\nStudy Characteristics\nThe study characteristics are summarized in Supplementary Table 2. Three systematic reviews met our protocol eligibility criteria [7, 21, 22]. Data on 1327 patients from 6 case studies [23\u201328], 20 case series [8, 17, 20, 29\u201345], 2 case-comparison studies [46, 47], and 1 prospective cohort [48] were included. We identified 13 observational studies published between 1918 and 1920, which studied 980 patients who received a clinical diagnosis of influenza-associated pneumonia or Spanish influenza A (H1N1) infection [17, 20, 33\u201335, 38\u201344, 47]. It is unclear whether some of these studies recruited patients with secondary bacterial pneumonia. Sixteen observational studies that met our protocol eligibility criteria were published between 2003 and 2011. Four studies reported outcomes for 29 patients infected with avian influenza A(H5N1) [23, 26, 27, 36], 4 studies reported outcomes for 104 patients infected with influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 [24, 30, 37, 48], and 8 studies reported outcomes for 214 patients with SARS [8, 25, 28, 29, 31, 32, 45, 46]. The clinical status of patients at the time of treatment administration varied, as did concomitant treatments and comorbidities. Convalescent plasma was used in all observational studies of SARS-CoV, influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, and avian influenza A(H5N1) infections (Supplementary Table 2). For Spanish influenza A(H1N1) infection, 2 observational studies used convalescent plasma, and 11 used convalescent serum (Supplementary Table 2). No studies that used hyperimmune immunoglobulin met our protocol eligibility criteria. The use of sham treatments or placebos was not reported.\nRisk of Bias Within Studies\nTwo systematic reviews were at low risk of bias [7, 21], whereas one was at moderate to low risk of bias across most domains (Table 1) [22]. Data extraction was judged to be a moderate source of bias in all systematic reviews. Search strategies were also a moderate source of bias in 2 systematic reviews, as grey literature and non\u2013peer-reviewed sources were not considered [7, 22].\nTable 1.\nRisk of Bias Assessment in the Eligible Systematic Reviews Using US Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality Tool\nDomain Luke et al [21]: Mortality and Serious Adverse Events Ortiz et al [22]: Mortality Stockman et al [7]: Serious Adverse Events\nStudy question  Low risk of bias  Moderate risk of bias  Low risk of bias \nSearch strategy  Low risk of bias  Moderate risk of bias  Moderate risk of bias \nInclusion and exclusion criteria  Moderate risk of bias  Low risk of bias  Low risk of bias \nInterventions  Moderate risk of bias  Moderate risk of bias  Low risk of bias \nOutcomes  Low risk of bias  Moderate risk of bias  Low risk of bias \nData extraction  Moderate risk of bias  Moderate risk of bias  Moderate risk of bias \nStudy quality and validity  Low risk of bias  Low risk of bias  Moderate risk of bias \nData synthesis and analysis  Low risk of bias  Low risk of bias  Low risk of bias \nResults  Low risk of bias  Moderate risk of bias  Low risk of bias \nDiscussion  Low risk of bias  Low risk of bias  Moderate risk of bias \nFunding or sponsorship  Low risk of bias  Low risk of bias  Low risk of bias \nOpen in new tab\nThe risks of bias of 2 outcomes in a single prospective cohort study were considered to be moderate (Table 2) [48].

This suggests that the observational study data included are at moderate to high risk of bias.\nFigure 2.\nOpen in new tabDownload slide\nSummary of outcome level risk of bias assessments in eligible observational studies, using the Newcastle Ottawa tool (excluding prospective cohort studies; 44 outcomes from 25 studies).\nThree studies were not assessed for risk of bias, because they presented insufficient data [17, 29, 45].\nResults of Individual Studies and Data Synthesis\nTable 3 summarizes our narrative synthesis, and Supplementary Table 3 shows results of the individual studies that included an all-cause mortality outcome. Meta-analyses, sensitivity analyses, and assessments of publication bias, by viral etiology, proved unfeasible due to a paucity of suitable data. There were no data available to address study questions relating to organ failure and sepsis or to hospital readmission and recurrence of severe disease.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 3.\nSummary of Narrative Synthesis\nNo. of Patients, Viral Etiology Patients Evaluated, No. Mortality\nIntervention, 699; Control, 568; Unknown, 60 Length of Hospital Stay Intervention, 92; Control, 16 Critical Care Support Intervention, 92; Control, 16 Antibody Levels Intervention, 4; Control, 0 Viral Load\nIntervention, 7; Control, 0; Unknown, 44 Adverse Events\nNot Reported at Patient Level\nSARS-CoV  The absolute reduction in the risk of mortality varied from 7% (95% CI, \u22122.39 to 18.68) to 23% (95% CI, 5.59\u201342.02) in 2 studies at medium to high risk of bias. Subgroup analyses suggested that early treatment was beneficial. Four noncomparative studies found that the CFR varied from 0% (0/1) to 12.5% (10/80).  The likelihood of discharge by day 22 was 54% greater (95% CI, 24.8%\u201384.6%) after treatment (77% vs 23%) in 1 study. A noncomparative study reported that 47% of treated patients were discharged by day 22, both of which were at moderate to high risk of bias. Results suggest that early treatment is beneficial.  No data were reported in identified studies.  No comparative data were reported. Increased antibody levels were detected up to day 5 after treatment in 1 study of healthcare workers, which was at high risk of bias.  No comparative data were reported. A decrease in viral load was reported after treatment in 1 noncomparative study, which was at high risk of bias.  No adverse events or complications were reported after treatment. \nInfluenza A(H1N1)pdm09  A relative reduction in the odds of mortality of 80% (adjusted odds ratio, 0.20; 95% CI, .06\u2013.69) was reported in 1 prospective study, which was at moderate risk of bias. Subgroup analyses suggest that early treatment was beneficial. One comparative study showed no significant benefit. Two noncomparative studies found that the CFR varied from 0% (0/1) to 25% (0/4).  The mean duration of stay was shorter after treatment (36.6 d vs 60 d; P = .23) in 1 study, which was at moderate risk of bias.  Reductions in the length of ICU stay (reduction in mean duration, 3.34 d), mechanical ventilation (4 d), and ECMO (10.3 d) were reported by 1 study, which was at moderate risk of bias.  No data were reported in identified studies.  Significantly lower viral load after treatment was observed at days 3, 5, and 7 after ICU admission in subgroup analysis of 1 prospective study, which was at moderate to high risk of bias. One noncomparative study found a reduction in viral load after treatment.  No adverse events or complications were reported after treatment. \nAvian influenza A(H5N1)  Nonsignificant benefits following intervention were reported in 1 study with comparator data. Three case reports reported no deaths.  No comparative data were reported. The length of hospital stay was 94 d in a case report at high risk of bias.  No comparative data were reported. One case report, which had a high risk of bias, cited that treatment allowed discontinuation of mechanical ventilation.  Specific antibodies were detected between day 7 and day 16 after treatment in a case report at high risk of bias.  No comparative data were reported. Three studies reported reductions in viral load after treatment.  No adverse events or complications were reported after treatment. \nSpanish influenza A(H1N1)a  A pooled absolute reduction of 21% (95% CI, 15%\u201327%)in the CFR was reported by a meta-analysis at low risk of bias. This pooled 6 studies, including 2 studies using convalescent blood. Subgroup analyses suggested that early treatment was beneficial. The absolute reduction in the risk of mortality ranged from 18.66% (95% CI, 10.62%\u201347.95%) to 21.60% (95% CI, 11.2%\u201331.93%) in 3 studies at high risk of bias. Ten noncomparative studies found that the CFR varied from 0% (0/2) to 50% (7/14).  No data were reported in identified studies.  No data were reported in identified studies.  No data were reported in identified studies.  No data were reported in identified studies.  Three studies reported chills, increased temperature, and sweats after infusion. \n\n\n\nAbbreviations: CFR, case-fatality rate; CI, confidence interval; ECMO, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation; ICU, intensive care unit; influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, 2009 pandemic influenza A(H1N1); SARS-CoV, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus.\na All studies reported use of convalescent plasma, except 11 studies, in which convalescent serum was used to treat Spanish influenza A(H1N1) infection, and 1 meta-analysis of 6 studies, 2 of which reported use of convalescent blood to treat Spanish influenza A(H1N1) infection. Additional data pertaining to individual studies (including comparator data, where presented) are available in the Supplementary Materials.\nOpen in new tab\nMortality\nSARS-CoV Infection\nTable 3 and Supplementary 3 summarize 8 observational studies at moderate to high risk of bias that reported improved mortality after patients received various doses of convalescent plasma [8, 25, 28, 29, 31, 32, 45, 46]. A retrospective case-comparison study showed a CFR reduction after plasma treatment that reached statistical significance (absolute reduction in CFR, 23%; 95% CI, 6%\u201342%; P = .049) [46]. A second study with a comparator group described a cluster of 29 cases of SARS-CoV infection in which 1 patient received convalescent plasma and survived (absolute reduction in CFR, 7%; 95% CI, \u22122% to 17%; P = .93) [32, 49]. Three small studies reported treatment of 5 patients with no deaths, and a case series by Cheng et al reported a CFR of 12.5% (10 of 80 patients) following treatment (Supplementary Table 3) [8, 9, 25, 28, 31, 45, 50]. Within this series, a subgroup analysis of 30 patients found that those treated when PCR-positive but seronegative for SARS-CoV were more likely to be discharged within 22 days of admission than those who were seropositive at the time of plasma infusion (67% vs 20%; P = .001). A further subgroup analysis of 48 patients found that receipt of convalescent plasma treatment <14 days after onset of symptoms improved the likelihood of discharge within 22 days of admission (58% vs 16%; P< .001); this remained significant after adjustment for age, viral status, time of administration, and lactate dehydrogenase level, suggesting that early treatment with convalescent plasma may be beneficial. However, allocation of treatment was mostly based on the physician's decision and the availability of plasma, and this study was at high risk of bias.\nInfluenza A(H1N1)pdm09 Infection\nFour observational studies [24, 30, 37, 48] and 1 systematic review [22] reported data on severe cases of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 infection treated with convalescent plasma (Table 3 and Supplementary Table 3). Hung et al [48] performed a prospective cohort study in which patients received a single 500-mL dose of convalescent plasma with a neutralizing antibody titer of >1:160. Univariate analysis showed a significant absolute reduction in CFR of 35% (95% CI, 14%\u201356%; P = .01) after treatment. Multivariable analysis also showed a significant reduction in the relative risk of mortality (OR, 0.20; 95% CI, .06\u2013.69; P = .011), although the factors adjusted for were not clearly stated. Both groups received other treatments, such as neuraminidase inhibitors and steroids (Supplementary Table 2). This nonrandomized study was at moderate risk of bias. A small study by Chan et al [30] at moderate risk of bias reported exclusively on patients who received extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) and showed a nonsignificant absolute reduction of 33% (95% CI, \u221220% to 87%) in the CFR after convalescent plasma treatment.\nAvian Influenza A(H5N1) Infection\nIn a case series at high risk of bias, in which 2 of 26 patients receiving convalescent plasma, a nonsignificant absolute reduction of 70% (95% CI, 52%\u201389%; P = .11) in the CFR was observed (Supplementary Table 3) [36]. Three case reports reported recovery among patients who were treated with convalescent plasma [23, 26, 27]. The dose of convalescent plasma varied across each study, and the neutralizing antibody titer was reported for only 1 case (1:80) [26]. All studies were at high to moderate risk of bias and had patients who were given other therapies concomitantly (including steroids and antivirals), which could have influenced the reported clinical effect.\nSpanish Influenza A(H1N1) Infection\nA systematic review and meta-analysis by Luke et al [21] showed that treatment with convalescent plasma, serum, or blood was associated with a significant absolute reduction of 21% (95% CI, 15%\u201327%) in the pooled CFR. Statistical heterogeneity was low (I2 = 29.3%), although interventions were clinically heterogeneous. Of the 6 studies included in the meta-analysis, 2 reported use of convalescent whole blood; however, these studies only contributed 84 patients (25%) in the treatment group. When timing of treatment was recorded, patients who received early treatment (<4 days from pneumonia onset) had a CFR of 19% (28 of 148), compared with 59% (49 of 83) for those treated later [21].\nOnly 2 studies of convalescent serum reported a comparator group [38, 47]. Both reported absolute reductions in CFR after treatment, with a reduction of 19% (95% CI, 11%\u201348%) in one and 22% (95% CI, 11%\u201332%) in the other; the reduction in the latter reached statistical significance (P = .008). The remaining studies observed a CFR ranging from 0% (0 of 2) to 48% (12 of 25) after treatment (Supplementary Table 3). A significant absolute reduction in the CFR was observed in a case series of 157 cases, 46 of whom received convalescent plasma (absolute reduction in the CFR, 18%; 95% CI, 8% to 30%; P = .0075) [33]. A further study of patients treated with convalescent plasma reported a CFR of 50% (7 of 14) [41].\nThe majority of studies on Spanish influenza A(H1N1) infection were found to have high risk of bias due to the use of now archaic research methods and a risk of wartime censorship and publication bias [21].\nExploratory Post Hoc Meta-analysis\nThe post hoc meta-analysis evaluated pooled data from 8 comparative studies: 2 studies of SARS-CoV infection [32, 46], 2 of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 infection [30, 48], 1 of avian influenza A(H5N1) infection [36], and 3 of Spanish influenza A(H1N1) infection [33, 38, 47]. There was a statistically significance lower risk of mortality in the group treated with convalescent plasma or serum (pooled OR, 0.25; 95% CI, .14 to .45; P < .001; I2 = 0%; Figure 3). Examination of the funnel plot and findings of the Egger test showed no evidence of publication bias. Sensitivity analyses that excluded studies with \u22645 cases demonstrated little variation in the pooled OR or change in statistical heterogeneity (Figure 4).\nFigure 3.\nOpen in new tabDownload slide\nForest plot of pooled odds ratios (ORs) of mortality following treatment with convalescent plasma or convalescent serum (n = 8 studies).

Weights are from random-effects analysis. Abbreviation: CI, confidence interval.\nMeta-analysis of the crude CFR in treated patients was rejected due to excessive statistical heterogeneity (I2 = 85%). Sensitivity analysis that excluded studies with \u22645 cases did not account for this and was similarly abandoned (I2 = 91%).\nHospital Length of Stay\nConvalescent plasma treatment was associated with a significant increase in the proportion of SARS-CoV\u2013infected patients discharged within 22 days of admission in 1 center (absolute difference, 54%; 95% CI, 25%\u201385%; P = .004) after excluding patients with comorbidities from the analysis (Table 3) [46]. A further SARS-CoV infection case series [31] reported that 47% of patients (15 of 33) were discharged by day 22, and initiation of therapy was significantly earlier among patients discharged by that time (mean number of days from symptom onset, 11.67 vs 16.04; P < .001). Both studies were at moderate to high risk of selection bias and confounding by indication. A case-comparison study at moderate risk of bias [30] reported no significant difference in length of hospital stay between treatment and control patients with severe pandemic influenza A(H1N1) infection who required ECMO (Table 3).\nDuration of Critical Care Support\nA retrospective observational study [30] reported that convalescent plasma treatment made nonsignificant reductions to the length of time spent in the intensive care unit, days of mechanical ventilation, or number of days of ECMO for 6 patients with severe pandemic influenza A (H1N1)pdm09 infection (Table 3). Two other case reports of pandemic influenza A (H1N1)pdm09 infection [24] and avian influenza A(H5N1) infection [27] also suggested that convalescent plasma may have aided clinical improvement and reduced the duration of mechanical ventilation.\nViral Antibody Levels\nWe identified limited evidence relating to levels of viral antibodies after convalescent plasma treatment; studies did not use a comparator and were at high risk of bias. Peaks in SARS-CoV antibody levels occurred 3\u20135 days following receipt of a single dose of convalescent plasma in 3 healthcare workers (Table 3) [8]. However, it is likely that other treatments, such as intravenous immunoglobulin, ribavirin and steroids, may have influenced the relationship between plasma and antibody levels. A case report of a patient with avian influenza A(H5N1) infection also found that virus-specific antibodies appeared 7\u201316 days following administration of convalescent plasma [23].\nViral Load\nThe SARS-CoV load in the respiratory tract decreased at a higher rate in patients who received convalescent plasma in a subgroup analysis of 44 patients with influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 infection in a prospective cohort study (Table 3); [48] viral loads were significantly lower 3, 5, and 7 days after intensive care unit admission. However, there was a high risk of selection bias for this outcome, and concomitant treatments, including oseltamivir, zanamivir, and corticosteroids, may have confounded the results.\nFurther studies reported that viral load became rapidly undetectable in the blood of 3 patients with SARS-CoV infection [8] and in respiratory tract specimens from a patient infected with influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 [24] after treatment. Similar decreases in viral loads in serum and respiratory tract specimens were observed in 3 cases of avian influenza A(H5N1) infection, with virus becoming undetectable 2\u20133 days after initiation of convalescent plasma treatment for 2 cases and 7\u201316 days after treatment initiation for the third case (Supplementary Table 3) [23, 26, 36].\nSevere Adverse Events and Treatment Complications\nNo studies reported a serious adverse event, and few studies reported information about treatment complications, although minor complications may be underreported in the literature. Two observational studies [8, 46] concerned with SARS-CoV infection reported that treatments did not cause harm when administered to patients. One study involving influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 infection reported that no adverse events were observed in the treatment group [48].\nThree studies from 1918\u20131920 (involving 101\u2013157 patients with influenza) reported minor infusion complications, including chills, increased temperature [34, 44], and sweats [33]. A study of 14 patients did not report chills or any serious complications. The methods and reporting of these studies reflect the period during which they were conducted, and the studies are therefore at high risk of bias.\nDISCUSSION\nOur analyses suggest that convalescent plasma may have a clinically relevant impact in reducing the rate of mortality and viral load in patients with SARI of viral etiology. Post hoc pooled meta-analysis across all viral etiologies showed a statistically significant 75% reduction in the odds of mortality among those who were treated with convalescent plasma or serum. We found no evidence of serious adverse events or complications due to therapy and limited evidence of a reduction in the use of critical care resources and the length of hospital stay.\nOf interest is the evidence for a survival benefit after early administration. A recent multicenter, prospective, double-blind, randomized control trial compared the use of hyperimmune immunoglobulin (derived from influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 convalescent plasma) to intravenous immunoglobulin manufactured before the 2009 pandemic [5]. For 22 patients from this study who received treatment within 5 days of symptom onset and were excluded per protocol, a multivariate subgroup analysis demonstrated that hyperimmune immunoglobulin had a protective effect (OR, 0.14; 95% CI, .02\u2013.92) [5]. Evidence from studies of SARS-CoV infection [31] and Spanish influenza A(H1N1) infection [21] showed a survival benefit following convalescent plasma treatment within 14 days and 4 days of symptom onset, respectively. These findings suggest that early initiation of treatment may be of critical importance to reducing mortality in patients with SARI of viral etiology.\nLimitations\nA lack of high-quality studies and a paucity in the volume of relevant literature limited our analyses. Observational studies were predominately case reports or series, had no control groups, and had a moderate to high risk of bias. Findings were commonly at high risk of confounding by indication. Although selection or reporting bias may favor the intervention, recruiting patients who are clinically deteriorating or moribund would bias the result in the opposite direction. Adequate methodological or statistical measures were infrequently used to control bias and confounding, and we identified numerous sources of clinical and methodological heterogeneity. We cannot be assured that all Spanish influenza A(H1N1) infection studies were included since our protocol did not include hand searching of literature from 1918\u20131920. Although our post hoc meta-analyses were undertaken to help inform clinical decision making, the theoretical rationale for pooling mortality data from different viral etiologies remains to be fully established. The results obtained must be considered experimental and interpreted with an appropriate level of caution.\nImplications for Practice\nWe did not identify any reports of convalescent plasma use for patients with MERS-CoV infection. The evidence for a reduction in mortality associated with convalescent plasma is strongest for SARS and influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 infection. Although it is clinically rational to consider novel therapies for critically ill patients, there is evidence that maximum benefit from convalescent plasma might be realized through early initiation of therapy. However, many treatment protocols currently mention convalescent plasma as a treatment of last resort. If this treatment is considered for MERS-CoV\u2013infected patients with SARI, it should ideally only be administered in acute centers able to manage potential treatment-related complications, such as transfusion-related acute lung injury. We consider this a precautionary approach because of the limited clinical experience of administering convalescent plasma to this patient group.\nFurther Research Needs\nImproved knowledge regarding the mode of action of convalescent plasma and the virologic and immunologic kinetics of novel respiratory infections that cause SARI (such as MERS-CoV) are needed. This would help clarify the potential benefits and harms of treatment, identify optimal dosage, and ascertain whether repeated treatments are relevant factors for clinical practice. Randomized controlled trials or observational studies that adopt a standardized minimum data set are needed to better evaluate convalescent plasma as a therapeutic option for MERS-CoV infection before it can be fully recommended or before refinements can be made over its current use, other than our current recommendation for early use. The WHO and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium are currently developing a clinical trial protocol to investigate the effectiveness of passive immunotherapy for patients with SARI.\nConclusion\nAvailable evidence suggests that convalescent plasma is likely to reduce mortality during SARIs of viral etiology, with larger treatment effects if it commenced early after symptom onset. However, this is based on predominately low-quality, uncontrolled studies. Our review supports the use of convalescent plasma in critically ill MERS-CoV\u2013infected patients as part of a well-designed clinical trial or other formal evaluation.\nSTUDY GROUP MEMBERS\nWe thank the following reviewers from the Convalescent Plasma Study Group, who evaluated non\u2013English-language articles on the basis of protocol eligibility criteria and undertook risk of bias assessments and data extraction: Dr Ana L.

As the authors note, current World Health Organization and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines for protection of healthcare professionals from influenza virus infection rely on the supposition that, under routine conditions, most transmission occurs via large droplets, rather than via small-particle aerosols [2, 3]. Under these guidelines, aerosol transmission is presumed to be limited to certain aerosol-generating procedures (AGPs), for which higher-level respiratory protection is recommended. The designation of AGPs has been made in large part by extrapolation from epidemiologic studies of outbreaks of other respiratory infections, such as tuberculosis and SARS coronavirus infection [4]. Whether such procedures are uniquely associated with generation of potentially infectious aerosols has not been established.\nAs part of a pilot study, we recently enrolled patients with and those without respiratory infections who were undergoing potential AGPs at a tertiary-care hospital. All patients provided written informed consent. We included patients with documented influenza virus infection during periods when they were undergoing mechanical ventilation and/or during periods when they were breathing on their own. We sampled air within 0.91 m (3 feet) and 1.83 m (6 feet) of the patient and outside the room for 3.25 hours, using National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health 2-stage aerosol samplers [5]. Aerosol sampling was also performed for 1 to several minutes near the patient's mouth, using closed-faced filter cassettes during extubation, suctioning, and use of an incentive spirometer. Influenza virus RNA copy number was determined by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and the mean value of 2 replicates was used in analysis.\nVariability in influenza virus RNA\u2013laden aerosol generation was evident. The experience of one patient with influenza diagnosed on hospital day 1 by PCR of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid is informative (Table 1). On hospital day 2, we obtained samples while the patient was breathing with the assistance of a mechanical ventilator. On hospital day 3, we obtained samples during extubation and subsequently while the patient was breathing on his own. On hospital day 4, we again obtained samples while the patient was breathing on his own. On each day, influenza virus RNA was detected in particles of respirable size, but a relationship to what we considered to be potential AGPs (mechanical ventilation, suctioning, extubation, and use of an incentive spirometer) was not evident. Indeed, potential respiratory exposures to healthcare professionals in the room appeared highest on hospital day 4, when the patient was breathing on his own and care was routine. Interestingly, the highest concentration of influenza virus RNA copies observed during these 3 days of sampling occurred on hospital day 3, outside of the patient's room. Although genetic comparison to the patient's virus was not performed, the pattern suggested a source of influenza virus other than the patient and underscored the challenges of studying and controlling influenza virus transmission in the hospital setting.\nTable 1.\nResults of Air Sampling Near a Patient With Influenza\nSampler Location, Height, Stage Influenza A Virus Load, Copies/m3 of Air\nHospital Day 2 Hospital Day 3 Hospital Day 4\nHead of beda       \n1.52 m       \nFirst (\u22654 \u00b5m)  Not detected  Not detected  826 \nSecond (1\u20134 \u00b5m)  216  Not detected  983 \nFilter (<1 \u00b5m)  Not detected  112  Not detected \nTotal respirable (<4 \u00b5m)  216  112  983 \n1.02 m       \nFirst (\u22654 \u00b5m)  Not detected  Not detected  Not detected \nSecond (1\u20134 \u00b5m)  414  Not detected  Not detected \nFilter (<1 \u00b5m)  Not detected  Not detected  Not detected \nTotal respirable (<4 \u00b5m)  414  Not detected  Not detected \nRight of bed (1.83 m from patient) \n1.52 m       \nFirst (\u22654 \u00b5m)  32 770  Not detected  26 \nSecond (1\u20134 \u00b5m)  Not detected  Not detected  29 887 \nFilter (<1 \u00b5m)  Not detected  Not detected  Not detected \nTotal respirable (<4 \u00b5m)  Not detected  Not detected  29 887 \n1.02 m       \nFirst (\u22654 \u00b5m)  Not detected  Not detected  Not detected \nSecond (1\u20134 \u00b5m)  Not detected  Not detected  2085 \nFilter (<1 \u00b5m)  Not detected  Not detected  Not detected \nTotal respirable (<4 \u00b5m)  Not detected  Not detected  2085 \nOutside room       \n1.52 m       \nFirst (\u22654 \u00b5m)  Not detected  Not detected  Not detected \nSecond (1\u20134 \u00b5m)  Not detected  3844  44 \nFilter (<1 \u00b5m)  Not detected  Not detected  Not detected \nTotal respirable (<4 \u00b5m)  Not detected  3844  44 \n1.02 m       \nFirst (\u22654 \u00b5m)  Not detected  Not detected  Not detected \nSecond (1\u20134 \u00b5m)  Not detected  329 152  141 \nFilter (<1 \u00b5m)  Not detected  Not detected  53 \nTotal respirable (<4 \u00b5m)  Not detected  329 152  194 \nNear patient mouth during suctioning \n0 m       \nFilter  Not detected  Not done  Not done \nNear patient mouth during extubation \n0 m       \nFilter  Not done  Not detected  Not done \nNear patient mouth during spirometer use \n0 m       \nFilter  Not done  2913  Not done \nOn hospital day 2, patient was breathing with the assistance of a mechanical ventilator.

This location was chosen to limit interference with clinical activities, but it may have contributed to the relatively low number of influenza A virus copies in the larger stage (\u22654 \u00b5m).\nOpen in new tab\nBischoff et al found that the majority of influenza virus RNA was contained in small particles. This observation corroborates previous work [5\u20137] and raises the possibility that aerosol transmission of influenza virus may occur during routine patient care [8]. Looking forward, by better characterizing the risk of infection when influenza virus\u2013laden aerosols are generated, such as verifying the infectivity of virus found in small particles and/or demonstrating an increased risk of influenza virus infection among healthcare professionals due to small particle aerosols, future studies may prompt a reconsideration of current guidelines for protecting such individuals from influenza virus infection. Yet as our experience suggests, multiple sources of influenza virus are possible in healthcare settings, and some of these sources (whether they are patients, fellow healthcare workers, or visitors with undiagnosed infection) will go unrecognized. Thus, use of preventive measures that do not require source recognition, such as vaccination, will remain of paramount importance.\nNotes\nDisclaimer.\u2003The findings and conclusions in this report are those of the authors and do not necessarily represent the views of the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health.\nFinancial support.\u2003This work was supported by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (intramural funds).\nPotential conflicts of interest.\u2003All authors: No reported conflicts.\nAll authors have submitted the ICMJE Form for Disclosure of Potential Conflicts of Interest.

The polyproline region (PPR) and the macro domain of ORF1 protein may modulate virus production and/or the host immune response. We investigated the association between the genetic heterogeneity of HEV quasispecies in ORF1 and the outcome of infection in solid-organ transplant patients. Both sequence entropy and genetic distances during the hepatitis E acute phase were higher in patients whose infection became chronic than in those who cleared the virus. Hence, great quasispecies heterogeneity in the regions encoding the PPR and the macro domain may facilitate HEV persistence.\nhepatitis E, chronic infection, ORF1, polyproline region, macro domain\nTopic: immune response heterogeneity hepatitis e entropy genetic heterogeneity hepatitis e virus immunocompromised host infections genetics transplantation viruses host (organism) chronic infection\nIssue Section: Parasites\nHepatitis E virus (HEV) is a major cause of enterically transmitted non-A, non-B hepatitis. It is also responsible for large outbreaks of waterborne acute hepatitis in tropical and subtropical countries as well as sporadic infections worldwide. Hepatitis E is a zoonotic disease in industrialized countries, with pigs, wild boar, and deer being the major animal reservoirs of HEV [1]. HEV, genus Hepevirus, family Hepeviridae, is an unenveloped, single-stranded, positive-sense RNA virus. Like all RNA viruses, HEV exists as a mixture of closely related variants defining a quasispecies. The approximately 7.2 kb genome of HEV has a coding region consisting of 3 open reading frames (ORFs). ORF2 encodes the capsid protein; ORF3 encodes a small protein implicated in virus egress [2], whereas ORF1 encodes a nonstructural protein that contains several putative functional domains. These include at least 4 enzyme activities: methyltransferase, cystein protease, helicase, and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase [2]. Homologies with other plant and animal positive strand RNA viruses have been used to identify other domains: the Y domain, the polyproline region (PPR), and the macro domain.\nThe PPR is genetically very diverse and could correspond to an intrinsically disordered region involved in virus adaptation [3]. In addition, the PPR does not seem to be required for HEV replication in vitro or in vivo [4]. Nonstructural virus genes that are not essential for replication are usually involved in modulating host immune responses [5]. The genomes of several virus families, including all members of Coronaviridae, rubella virus, and alphaviruses (Togaviridae), and HEV, have macro domains. The macro domain of the mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) influences the pathogenicity of the virus [6].\nHEV can lead to chronic hepatitis in solid-organ transplant (SOT) patients [7]. But our knowledge of the factors associated with the development of chronic infection in SOT patients exposed to HEV is far from complete.\nOur working hypothesis was that the genetic heterogeneity of the PPR or the macro domain play a role in the outcome of HEV infection in immunocompromised patients, as the PPR could modulate the host immune response and the macro domain could influence virus pathogenicity. We therefore analysed the characteristics of HEV quasispecies at the acute phase of hepatitis E in 2 groups of SOT patients, one whose infection became chronic and the other who cleared the virus.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nPatients and Samples\nWe studied 14 SOT patients who became acutely infected with hepatitis E between January 2004 and June 2009. The infection was diagnosed by the detecting HEV RNA using the real time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and immunoglobulin M/immunoglobulin G anti-HEV antibodies by a commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay [8]. Each patient was assigned to one of 2 groups according to the outcome of the infection. The first group (group I; 8 patients) had chronic infections, defined by persistently elevated liver enzyme activity and serum that was positive for HEV RNA for more than 6 months after diagnosis. The second group (group II; 6 patients) had resolving infections. Serum samples were collected from all patients at the acute phase of their infection and stored at \u221280\u00b0C.\nEach patient underwent an exhaustive clinical and laboratory examination, including the immunosuppressive drugs used, the hepatic enzyme activities, and white blood cell count. The serum concentration of HEV RNA was measured by real-time PCR [9]. Virus genotype was determined by sequencing a 189-nucleotide fragment within the ORF2 gene. The sequences were compared to reference HEV strains (Genbank) as described elsewhere [10].\nAmplification of an ORF1 Fragment Encompassing the PPR and the Macro Domain\nNucleic acids were extracted from serum samples and analysed by 1-step RT-PCR with the sense primer HEVORF1-S1 and anti-sense primer HEVORF1-A1 using the Super script III enzyme (Invitrogen, Cergy-Pontoise, France). The sequences of the primers are listed in Supplementary Table 1.\nThe sequence amplified included the PPR (nucleotide [nt] 2137\u20132340) and the macro domain (nt 2341\u20132829), using the genome 1b L08816 as a reference. The PCR products were purified using Qiaprep (Qiagen, Courtaboeuf, France) miniprep kits and stored at \u221220\u00b0C.\nIn total, 10 ng of the amplified sequence were directly ligated into 1 \u00b5L of PCR 4 vector (kit TOPO TA Cloning; Invitrogen) containing a gene conferring resistance to ampicilline. Recombinant plasmids were used to transform Escherichia coli-competent cells, and transformants were grown on ampicillin-coated plates at 37\u00b0C for 18 hours. The complementary DNA (cDNA) clones (20 from each patient sample) were analysed by PCR with the primers HEVORF1-S1 and HEVORF1-A1 (Supplementary Table 1).\nNucleotide Sequence Analysis\nThe PCR products of these amplifications were purified (Quick-Spin columns; Qiagen) and sequenced using the fluorescent dye terminator method for Big DyeTerminator cycle sequencing (Applied Biosystems, Paris, France) with the primers HEVORF1-S1, HEVORF1-S2, HEVORF1-S3, HEVORF1-A1 and HEVORF1-A2 (Supplementary Table 1) on an Applied Biosystems ABI 3130 XL analyzer. Sequences were aligned using Clustal X and compared with those of HEV strains obtained from Genbank.\nCalculation of Genetic Complexity and Diversity\nWe quantified the complexity of the HEV quasispecies by calculating the Shannon entropy: S = \u2212\u03a3i (pi ln pi), where pi is the frequency of each sequence in the viral quasispecies. The normalized entropies for both nucleotides and amino-acids, Sn, were calculated using Sn = S/ln N, where N is the total number of sequences analysed.\nWe quantified diversity as the mean genetic distance calculated for all pairs of nucleotide sequences using Mega 4.0. The numbers of synonymous (Ks) substitutions per synonymous site and nonsynonymous (Ka) substitutions per nonsynonymous site were calculated with the Jukes-Cantor correction for multiple substitutions using MEGA 4.0. The Ka/Ks ratio is an indicator of the positive (>1) or negative (<1) selection pressure on a quasispecies [11].\nStatistical Analysis\nProportions were compared by Fisher exact test. Quantitative variables were compared with the nonparametric Mann\u2013Whitney test. Correlations between complexities or diversities of quasispecies were estimated by calculating Spearman rank correlation coefficient. A P-value below .05 was considered to be statistically significant.\nNucleotide Sequence Accession Numbers\nThe sequences have been deposited in the GenBank database under accession numbers KC911858 to KC912137.\nRESULTS\nPatient Characteristics\nThe clinical and biological characteristics of the patients are summarized in Supplementary Table 2. There was no significant difference between patients with chronic infections and those with resolving infections in terms of gender, age, or immunosuppressant treatment. The ALT activities of individuals with a chronic infection tended to be lower. Patients whose infection became chronic had lower total, CD3, CD4, and CD8 lymphocyte counts, but the differences were not significant. The serum HEV RNA concentrations at the acute phase of the 2 groups of patients were similar. They were all infected with HEV genotype 3f strains, except one whose infection was genotype 3c.\nAssociation Between Quasispecies Heterogeneity and the Development of a Chronic Infection\nWe compared the sequence heterogeneity of 2 regions of ORF1 in patients with chronic HEV infection and those with resolving infections.\nThe mean nucleotide sequence entropy (nt complexity) of the PPR was higher in group I (0.63 [0.53\u20130.75]) than in group II (0.43 [0.38\u20130.52]; P = .03). Similar results were obtained for the macro domain (0.73 [0.60\u20130.91] in group I and 0.59 [0.50\u20130.54] in group II; P = .005) (Figure 1A).\nFigure 1.\nOpen in new tabDownload slide\nBox plot representation of quasispecies entropy for patients with chronic and resolving hepatitis E virus (HEV) infections.

The macro domain diversity was also greater in group I (0.0050 [0.0038\u20130.011]) than in group II (0.0023 [0.0019\u20130.0025]; P = .002; Figure 2).\nFigure 2.\nOpen in new tabDownload slide\nBox plot representation of quasispecies mean genetic distances for patients with chronic and resolving hepatitis E virus (HEV) infections.

The Mann\u2013Whitney test was used to compare differences between the 2 groups.\nThe nt complexity and diversity of the PPR were positively correlated with those of the macro domain (r = 0.69 P = .009 and r = 0.83 P = .0005, respectively).\nAssociation Between the Ka/Ks Ratio and the Development of a Chronic Infection\nThe ratios of nonsynonymous substitutions per nonsynonymous site (Ka) and synonymous substitutions per synonymous site (Ks) for the PPRs seemed to be higher in group I (0.51 [0.38\u20130.70]) than in group II (0.93 [0.61\u20131.75]), but the difference was not statistically significant (P = .30). The Ka/Ks ratios for the macro domains in group I (0.54 [0.17\u20130.93]) and group II (0.37 [0.27\u20130.38]; P = .90) were similar.\nDISCUSSION\nIt was shown recently that an HEV infection can evolve to a chronic infection in SOT recipients [7]. The viral determinants associated with the persistence of such an infection are poorly documented. We therefore investigated the influence of the genetic heterogeneity of HEV quasispecies on the outcome of infection, focusing on the PPR and the macro domain.\nBoth the complexity and diversity of the PPR and the macro domain were higher in viral population of the patients whose infection became chronic than in those who cleared the virus. It has been shown that the quasispecies heterogeneity in the ORF2 region encoding the capsid protein during the acute phase of infection is associated with the development of a chronic HEV infection [12]. Our data support the finding that great genetic heterogeneity of the quasispecies in patients whose infection become chronic seems to favor the appearance of variants that can persist, as reported for HCV infections [13]. Although the diversity of the region preceding the PPR was higher in patients with chronic infection, nt and aa complexities were not different in the 2 groups (data not shown), suggesting that the higher heterogeneity in chronic patients was not a general effect seen across the entire region studied. This great genetic heterogeneity could also reflect an inadequate control of the viral replication, but no correlation was found between quasispecies heterogeneity and viral concentrations. PPR appears to be dispensable for in vitro HEV replication, but it is required for in vivo infection, suggesting that it is involved in infecting cells with innate immunity [4]. Although the role of the macro domain in the replication of HEV is unknown, it does not seem to be essential for the replication of coronavirus in cell culture [14]. It was recently suggested that genes that are dispensable for virus replication are involved in modulating the host immune response, like down-regulating interleukin 1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2) or tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 (TNF- \u03b1) secretion [5]. The macro domain is also involved in the inflammation caused by the mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), and the substitution of a strictly conserved amino-acid residue is responsible for reducing the secretion of inflammatory cytokines [6]. The great quasispecies heterogeneity in patients whose infection became chronic may include some variants that reduce inflammatory cytokine production, which could facilitate HEV persistence. This could explain the lower serum concentrations of interleukin 1 (IL-1) receptor antagonist and TNF-\u03b1 found in patients whose infection became chronic [12].\nWe find that the complexities and diversities of the PPR and the macro domain are correlated. These 2 regions may well have evolved together as the protein encoded by ORF1 does not seem to be cleaved [15]. We also studied the correlations between the ORF1 and ORF2 as this study and our previous one on ORF2 diversity [12] were carried out on the same patients (except for 3). We also find that the complexity and diversity of the regions in ORF1 and ORF2 that were studied are correlated (data not shown), suggesting that they, too, have evolved together.\nFinally, we find no differences in the Ka/Ks ratios of the studied regions, even though the Ka/Ks ratios of the PPR seemed to be higher in patients who cleared the virus. Alternatively, the Ka/Ks ratio may not allow us to infer differences in selection pressure. In both regions, Ka/Ks ratios indicate negative selection, probably due to structural or functional constraints. A limitation of our study is the small number of patients in each group and an implication of immunological factors in the evolution toward chronicity cannot be excluded.\nWe conclude that the high genetic heterogeneity of the PPR and the macro domain at the acute phase of an HEV infection is associated with persistence of the virus. This association may be due to the appearance of mutants able to modulate the host immune response. Further investigation is now needed to confirm this association.\nNotes\nFinancial support.\u2003This work was supported by Institut national de la sant\u00e9 et de la recherche m\u00e9dicale U1043.\nPotential conflicts of interest.\u2003All authors: No reported conflicts.\nAll authors have submitted the ICMJE Form for Disclosure of Potential Conflicts of Interest.

Although bacterial infection is known to complicate viral infections, the frequency and impact of mixed viral-bacterial infections has not been well studied.\nMethods.\u2003Adults hospitalized with respiratory illness during 3 winters underwent comprehensive viral and bacterial testing. This assessment was augmented by measuring the serum level of procalcitonin (PCT) as a marker of bacterial infection. Mixed viral-bacterial infection was defined as a positive viral test result plus a positive bacterial assay result or a serum PCT level of \u2265 0.25 ng/mL on admission or day 2 of hospitalization.\nResults.\u2003Of 842 hospitalizations (771 patients) evaluated, 348 (41%) had evidence of viral infection. A total of 212 hospitalizations (61%) involved patients with viral infection alone. Of the remaining 136 hospitalizations (39%) involving viral infection, results of bacterial tests were positive in 64 (18%), and PCT analysis identified bacterial infection in an additional 72 (21%). Subjects hospitalized with mixed viral-bacterial infections were older and more commonly received a diagnosis of pneumonia. Over 90% of hospitalizations in both groups involved subjects who received antibiotics. Notably, 4 of 10 deaths among subjects hospitalized with viral infection alone were secondary to complications of Clostridium difficile colitis.\nConclusions.\u2003Bacterial coinfection is associated with approximately 40% of viral respiratory tract infections requiring hospitalization. Patients with positive results of viral tests should be carefully evaluated for concomitant bacterial infection. Early empirical antibiotic therapy for patients with an unstable condition is appropriate but is not without risk.\nvirus, bacterial infection, procalcitonin, pneumonia\nTopic: antibiotics bacterial infections adult pneumonia respiratory system respiratory tract infections virus diseases infections diagnosis viruses coinfection laboratory test finding\nIssue Section: Viruses\nRespiratory tract infections are one of the most common reasons for hospital admission among adults. Recent evidence indicates that a significant proportion of these illnesses are associated with viruses [1\u20133]. Although influenza virus remains indisputably the most significant viral respiratory pathogen in adults, a number of other common respiratory viruses contribute to the substantial burden of disease in older populations. Sensitive molecular techniques are evolving rapidly, and point-of-care testing for respiratory viruses will soon be possible [4]. While these tools will provide a more accurate assessment of the impact of respiratory viruses, it is unclear whether these new diagnostic tests will affect patient management, because of overriding concerns about possible bacterial coinfection, particularly in individuals requiring hospitalization [5, 6].\nThe occurrence of staphylococcal and pneumococcal pneumonia as a complication during influenza pandemics, including the recent 2009 influenza A(H1N1) pandemic, is well recognized [7, 8]. In vitro and animal studies demonstrate viral-bacterial synergy promoted by enhanced bacterial adherence and immune-mediated interactions [9]. Although temporal associations between bacterial pneumonia and seasonal viral respiratory tract infection have been reported, there are few specific data on the risk of bacterial complications of seasonal influenza and other virus infections [1, 10, 11]. The study of bacterial lung infection has been hampered by the lack of specific and sensitive tests for invasive disease. Results of blood cultures are infrequently positive, and sputum may be contaminated by upper airway tract secretions, leading to overdiagnosis of infection [12]. In most cases, clinical, laboratory, and radiographic findings do not reliably distinguish viral from bacterial infections [13]. Newer tests such as urinary antigen analysis and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) can augment traditional microbiologic testing but are not available for all organisms. Thus, clinicians continue to struggle with ruling out bacterial respiratory tract infection in patients with viral infection, and antibiotics are almost universally used in hospitalized patients [6].\nRecently, serum biomarkers such as procalcitonin (PCT) have been evaluated as surrogate indicators of bacterial infection. PCT, a calcitonin precursor normally produced in neuroendocrine cells of the thyroid and lung, is secreted by cells throughout the body in response to bacterial infections [14]. Serum PCT levels of <0.25 ng/mL are uncommon with invasive bacterial disease, and PCT determinations have been used as a guide to antibiotic therapy in patients with respiratory tract illnesses, including community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), without an increased frequency of adverse outcomes [15].\nWe sought to more accurately define the incidence and impact of bacterial coinfection in patients hospitalized with documented viral infection, using a panel of bacteria-specific diagnostic tests augmented by measurement of the serum PCT level.\nMETHODS\nPatient Population\nThe study was performed at Rochester General Hospital in Rochester, New York. Adults aged \u226521 years admitted through the emergency department with diagnoses compatible with acute respiratory tract infection were recruited from 1 November through 30 May during 3 winters (2008\u20132011). Patients were screened within 24 hours of hospitalization, excluding those given antibiotics prior to admission or with immunosuppression, cavitary lung disease, or witnessed aspiration. Informed consent was obtained from subjects or their legal guardians. The study was approved by the University of Rochester and Rochester General Hospital institutional review boards.\nIllness Evaluation\nAt enrollment, demographic, clinical, and laboratory information was collected. To provide uniformity, a primary clinical admitting diagnosis was assigned by a pulmonary specialist after examination of each subject and review of laboratory and radiographic findings. All subjects underwent testing for bacterial pathogens, including blood culture, sputum culture and Gram stain, Streptococcus pneumoniae urine antigen and pneumococcal serologic testing, and PCR of sputum and nose and throat swab specimens for Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Chlamydophila pneumoniae. Sputum was induced with normal saline if subjects were unable to expectorate a sample that was considered adequate on the basis of standard criteria. Nose and throat swab and sputum specimens were tested for viruses by reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR), and sera were collected on admission and 4\u20136 weeks later for viral and pneumococcal serologic testing. Serum was also collected on hospital day 2 for PCT measurement.\nLaboratory Methods\nStandard Microbiological Testing\nBlood cultures, sputum Gram stain and culture, influenza virus antigen testing, and viral cultures were performed by the Rochester General Hospital clinical laboratory, and results were available to clinicians for patient care. Sputum samples were plated on blood, chocolate, and MacConkey agar. Legionella testing (by sputum culture and urinary antigen assay) was performed at the discretion of the treating physician. Single blood cultures positive for organisms consistent with skin flora (ie, coagulase-negative staphylococcus, corynebacterium, \u03b1 hemolytic streptococci, and Propionibacterium acnes) were considered contaminants. Sputum cultures were only considered positive if more than a rare pathogenic bacteria grew from an adequate sample with the exception of Legoinella.\nS. pneumoniae Serologic Analysis\nPneumococcal surface protein A antigens covering families 1 and 2, obtained from the University of Alabama Bacterial Respiratory Pathogen Reference Laboratory, were used in an enzyme immunoassay [16]. A \u22654-fold rise in titer was considered evidence of infection.\nUrinary Antigen Testing for S. pneumoniae\nUrine samples were assayed for pneumococcal antigen, using the Binax NOW urine assay (Binax, Scarborough, ME).\nPCT Level\nPCT levels were measured by resolved amplified cryptate emission technology (Kryptor PCT, Brahms, Henningsdorf, Germany). The functional sensitivity of the assay is 0.06 ng/mL (mean normal level [\u00b1SD], 0.033 \u00b1 0.003 ng/mL) [17].\nViral Serologic Analysis\nImmunoglobulin G titers in acute- and convalescent-phase serum specimens were determined using established methods for influenza A and B viruses, respiratory syncytial virus, human metapneumovirus, parainfluenza types 1\u20133, and human coronaviruses 229E and OC43 [18]. A \u22654-fold rise in the viral specific immunoglobulin G level was considered evidence of infection.\nReal-Time PCR Analysis\nAssays for respiratory syncytial virus, human metapneumovirus, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and Chlamydophila pneumoniae were performed using published methods [19\u201321]. Human rhinovirus assays were performed on the basis of methods published by Lu et al, with the following modification of the forward primer (5\u2032-CYGCCZGCGTGGY-3\u2032) [22]. Primers and probes for other viruses were as follows: influenza A virus (Matrix gene), influenza B virus (NS1 gene), human coronaviruses 229E and OC43 (polymerase gene), and parainfluenza viruses 1\u20133 (nucleocapsid gene). Sequences will be supplied on request.\nDefinitions\nVirus Infection Alone\nVirus infection alone was defined as nose and throat swab samples or a sputum sample positive for any virus by one of the following assays: (1) RT-PCR (for all viruses), (2) a rapid influenza antigen test, or (3) serologic analysis (for all viruses, with exception of those detected during illness coinciding with influenza vaccination). Additional criteria involved negative results of all tests for bacteria and serum PCT values of <0.25 ng/mL on admission and day 2.\nBacterial Infection Alone\nBacterial infection alone was defined on the basis of negative results of viral diagnostic tests and any of the following: (1) a positive blood culture result, (2) a culture of an adequate sputum sample that was positive for a respiratory pathogen, (3) a urinary antigen test positive for S. pneumoniae or Legionella pneumophila, (4) a serologic assay positive for pneumococci, (5) a PCR assay positive for M. pneumoniae or C. pneumoniae, or (6) a serum PCT level of \u22650.25 ng on admission or hospital day 2.\nMixed Viral-Bacterial Infection\nA mixed viral-bacterial infection met the definitions for bacterial infection and viral infection.\nStatistical Methods\nContinuous variables were compared using the nonparametric Wilcoxon test, and categorical variables were compared using the Fisher exact test. Pearson correlation coefficients were used to summarize dependencies between pairs of continuous variables. For univariate analysis comparing mixed viral-bacterial infection with viral infection alone, the false-discovery rate was used to account for multiple comparisons [23]. Multiple logistic regression analysis was used to model the outcome (mixed viral-bacterial infection vs viral infection alone) as a function of a subset of candidate predictors, including age of \u226565 years, KATZ functional score, symptoms for \u22657 days, temperature of \u226538\u00b0C, pulse rate, systolic blood pressure of \u2265100 beats/min, CURB-65 score, oxygen saturation level of \u2265 85%, peripheral white blood cell count (WBC) of \u226512 000 cells/mL, anion gap, log2 blood urea nitrogen level, sex, diabetes mellitus, congestive heart failure, COPD, chronic renal failure, active smoking, steroid use, influenza vaccination, clinical admission diagnoses (pneumonia, acute exacerbation of COPD, bronchitis, congestive heart failure, asthma, viral infection/influenza, or other diagnosis), nasal congestion, sputum production, confusion, wheezing, rales, positive viral PCR findings, and radiographic findings (ie, no acute disease or infiltrate). Variables not included because of missing values included pneumococcal vaccination status, percentage of neutrophils or band forms in peripheral blood, and basal metabolic index.\nRESULTS\nDuring the 3-year study period, 2217 hospitalizations with appropriate admission diagnoses were screened. Hospitalizations were excluded for the following reasons: prior antibiotic use (in 354), immunosuppression (in 178), witnessed aspiration (in 26), and follow up not possible (in 71); 54 hospitalizations were excluded for other reasons. Of the 1534 hospitalizations eligible for inclusion, 368 involved patients who were not able to give consent, and 324 involved patients who refused to participate. Thus, 842 hospitalizations involving 771 patients who consented to participate were included in the study (Figure 1). A microbiologic diagnosis was made in 447 (53%) of 842 hospitalizations, of which 99 (12%) involved bacterial infection alone and 348 (41%) had evidence of viral infection. Of those involving viral infection, 212 (61%) had viral infection alone, 64 (18%) had evidence of mixed viral-bacterial infection on the basis of specific bacterial testing, and 72 (21%) were identified on the basis of an elevated serum PCT level. This report will focus on the 348 hospitalizations with documented viral infection (Table 1).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 1.\nIncidence of Viral Infection and Bacterial Coinfection Among Hospitalizations Involving Lower Respiratory Tract Infection\nPathogen 2008\u20132009\n(n = 282) 2009\u20132010\n(n = 274) 2011\u20132011\n(n = 286) Total\n(n = 842) Virus Positivity by PCR Bacteria-Specific Diagnosis PCT level \u2265 0.25 ng/mL on d 1 or 2 Bacteria- Specific Diagnosis or PCT Level \u2265 0.25\nInfluenza A virus  24  21  38  83 (10)  48 (58)  10 (12)  28 (34)  33 (40) \nInfluenza B virus  4  2  1  7 (0.8)  4 (57)  1 (14)  3 (43)  3 (43) \nRSV  20  24  11  55 (7)  42 (76)  10 (18)  14 (25)  17 (31) \nHMPV  22  9  7  38 (5)  32 (84)  10 (26)  9 (24)  15 (39) \nHCoV-OC43  35  1  20  56 (7)  46 (82)  8 (14)  19 (34)  22 (39) \nHCoV-229E  7  8  1  16 (2)  11 (69)  3 (19)  6 (38)  7 (44) \nPIV 1\u20133  12  11  1  24 (3)  16 (67)  7 (29)  9 (38)  12 (50) \nRhinovirus  10  10  10  30 (4)  30 (100)  5 (17)  6 (20)  9 (30) \nAdenovirusa  1  0  0  1 (0.1)  NA  0  0  0 \nViral- bacterial coinfection  13  8  17  38 (5)  27 (71)  10 (26)  10 (26)  18 (47) \nOverall  148  94  106  348 (41)  256 (74)  64 (19)  105 (30)  136 (39) \n\n\n\n\nData are no. or no.

Influenza A virus was the most common virus and accounted for 10% of hospitalizations, followed by respiratory syncytial virus (7%) and human coronavirus OC43 (7%). Influenza B virus was the least frequent virus detected (0.8%). Thirty-eight hospitalizations (5%) were associated with multiple viruses. The primary clinical diagnoses associated with virus infection were acute exacerbation of COPD (in 26% of hospitalizations), pneumonia (in 21%), acute bronchitis (in 18%), and asthma exacerbation (in 18%). The clinical admission diagnoses were similar for most pathogens, although the rate of pneumonia was lowest for human rhinovirus (in 10% of hospitalizations) and highest for human metapneumovirus (in 31%) and human coronavirus OC43 (in 30%). There were no significant differences in the rates of mixed viral-bacterial infection by viral pathogen, including 2009 pandemic A(H1N1) (bacterial co-infection rate was 35%).\nFor the 64 hospitalizations involving mixed viral-bacterial infections in which specific bacterial pathogens were documented, diagnosis was confirmed with blood culture (in 7 hospitalizations), sputum culture (in 35), pneumococcal urinary antigen testing (in 15), and pneumococcal serologic testing (in 19). Atypical bacteria were rarely identified (M. pneumoniae [in 2 hospitalizations] and C. pneumoniae [in 0]) during the first 2 years, and therefore testing was discontinued in the third year. S. pneumoniae accounted for 35 of 64 bacterial diagnoses (55%; Figure 2).\nFigure 2.\nOpen in new tabDownload slide\nNumber of specific bacterial pathogens identified in subjects with documented viral infection.\nOf the 348 hospitalizations involving viral infection, 344 (99%) had either an admission or day 2 PCT measurement, and 317 (91%) had both values available. Correlation between day 1 and 2 PCT levels was high (R = .90; P = .0001). Overall, 105 of the 344 hospitalizations (31%) with at least 1 PCT measurement involved patients with levels of \u22650.25 ng/mL (Table 1). On the basis of a positive bacterial test result or a PCT level of \u2265 0.25 ng/mL on admission or day 2, 136 of 348 hospitalizations (39%) involving viral illnesses had evidence of mixed viral-bacterial infection (Table 1). Of these, 33 involved both positive results of bacterial tests and elevated PCT levels, 31 involved only positive results of bacterial tests, and 72 involved only elevated PCT levels. Of note, despite vigorous attempts to collect adequate sputum in a timely fashion, we were frequently unable to procure adequate sputum within 6 hours of antibiotic administration. Thus, in 69% of the hospitalizations with bacterial infection defined on the basis of PCT level alone, the negative results of sputum cultures were considered unreliable, compared with 51% for the group as a whole.\nHospitalizations associated with elevated PCT levels with or without positive results of bacterial tests involved patients who were similar with respect to age, rate of pneumonia, physical examination findings, and severity of illness score. In contrast, hospitalizations associated with low PCT values and positive bacterial test results involved patients who were younger, had lower severity of illness scores, and were less likely to receive a diagnosis of pneumonia (19% vs 44%; P = .02) and more likely to receive a diagnosis of asthma or COPD exacerbations (55% vs 26%; P = .006) as compared to those associated with elevated PCT values.\nClinical and laboratory variables were compared according to bacterial test positivity (Table 2). Not surprisingly, hospitalizations associated with positive blood culture results involved patients with higher severity of illness scores and abnormal findings of more laboratory tests, compared with those associated with positive results of other bacterial tests or those associated with no positive bacterial test results. No consistent differences between the groups were noted with respect to admission diagnoses or radiologic findings. Bacteremic hospitalizations involved a significantly greater percentage of PCT measurements of >0.25 ng/mL, compared with those involving no positive results of bacterial tests (86% vs 25%; P = .002). Of note, the single hospitalization involving a bacteremic subject with a low PCT level yielded a clinical diagnosis of bronchitis and 1 blood culture positive for multiple organisms (enterococci, Staphylococcus aureus, and coagulase-negative staphylococci), raising the possibility of blood culture contamination. In addition, median PCT values were higher for groups with positive bacterial test results as compared to those with no positive bacterial test results (bacteremia, P = .001; urine antigen testing, P = .001; pneumococcal serologic testing, P = .001; and sputum culture alone, P = .055).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 2.\nCharacteristics of Hospitalizations Involving Subjects With Viral Illnesses, by Bacterial Test Positivity\nCharacteristic Blood Culture\n(n = 7) Urine Antigen Testa\n(n = 14) Pneumococcal Serologic Testa\n(n = 18) Sputum Culture Alone\n(n = 28) No Positive Test Result\n(n = 285)\nClinical admission diagnosis \nPneumonia  1 (14)  7 (50)  7 (39)  8 (29)  54 (19) \nExacerbation of COPD  1 (14)  2 (14)  3 (17)  10 (36)  80 (28) \nAcute bronchitis  2 (29)  2 (14)  1 (6)  2 (7)  51 (18) \nCongestive heart failure  0  1 (7)  2 (11)  1 (4)  17 (6) \nAsthma  0  2 (14)  2 (11)  7 (25)  52 (18) \nViral infection/influenza  0  0  1 (6)  0  26 (9) \nOther  3 (43)  0  2 (11)  0  5 (2) \nPhysical examination finding \nConfusion  1 (14)  1 (7)  3 (17)  2 (7)  31 (11) \nWheezes  4 (57)  7 (50)  6 (33)  19 (68)  165 (57) \nRales  5 (71)  8 (57)  7 (39)  11 (39)  98 (34) \nTemperature  37.4 \u00b1 1.5  37.6 \u00b1 0.9  37.4 \u00b1 0.9  37.3 \u00b1 1.1  37.5 \u00b1 1.0 \nPulse  124 \u00b1 23  113 \u00b1 17  114 \u00b1 17  106 \u00b1 20  105 \u00b1 46 \nSystolic BP, mm Hg  106 \u00b1 30  116 \u00b1 30  120 \u00b1 25  118 \u00b1 21  122 \u00b1 21 \nCURB-65 score  2.6 \u00b1 1.3  1.7 \u00b1 1.3  1.9 \u00b1 1.3  1.8 \u00b1 1.2  1.6 \u00b1 1.2 \nLaboratory finding \nWBC count, \u00d7 103 cells/\u00b5L  14.7 \u00b1 8.8  12.8 \u00b1 6.2  13.3 \u00b1 5.8  12.6 \u00b1 4.8  9.9 \u00b1 5.0 \nBands, %  14.2 \u00b1 0.0  12.8 \u00b1 17.2  8.0 \u00b1 15.8  5.6 \u00b1 10.1  2.9 \u00b1 6.6 \nAnion gap, mEq/L  11.2 \u00b1 5.3  10.0 \u00b1 2.6  10.6 \u00b1 2.3  9.2 \u00b1 3.5  8.7 \u00b1 2.7 \nPCT level > 0.25 ng/mLb  6 (86)  9 (64)  11 (61)  11 (39)  72 (25) \nHighest PCT level on d 1 or 2, median (IQR)c  15.5 (0.7\u201320.5)  0.4 (0.2\u201313.7)  1.2 (0.2\u20134.5)  0.2 (0.1\u20130.8)  0.1 (0.1\u20130.3) \nRadiographic finding \nNo acute disease  3 (43)  5 (36)  8 (44)  11 (39)  144 (50) \nInfiltrate  2 (29)  6 (43)  5 (28)  13 (46)  99 (34) \n\n\n\n\n\nData are no.

A number of clinical features were significantly different by univariate analysis, as shown in Table 3. Among hospitalizations associated with mixed viral-bacterial infections, subjects were older, had higher rates of chronic renal failure, more commonly received diagnoses of pneumonia, and less commonly received diagnoses of acute exacerbation of COPD and asthma. These subjects also had significantly lower systolic blood pressures, as well as significantly higher mean pulse rates, peripheral white blood cell counts, band forms, anion gaps, and blood urea nitrogen levels, although there was substantial overlap in these values. Multivariate analysis shown in Table 4 indicates that the factors that were mostly strongly predictive of mixed viral-bacterial infection (P < .01) were peripheral white blood cell count of >12 000 cells/mL (odds ratio [OR], 3.8), anion gap (OR, 1.2 per unit change), COPD (OR, 2.9), chronic renal failure (OR, 10.7), and infiltrate on chest radiograph (OR, 2.5).\n\n\n\n\nTable 3.\nCharacteristics of Hospitalizations Involving Viral Infection Alone Versus Mixed Viral-Bacterial Infections\nCharacteristic Missing Value Viral Alone\n(n = 212) Mixed Viral-Bacterial\n(n = 136) FDRa\nAge, y  0  62.7 \u00b1 17.4  67.4 \u00b1 16.5  0.03 \nFemale sex  0  127 (60)  74 (54)  0.44 \nDiabetes mellitus  1  76 (36)  53 (39)  0.75 \nCongestive heart failure  0  50 (24)  38 (28)  0.48 \nCOPD  1  79 (37)  59 (44)  0.38 \nChronic renal failure  2  2 (1)  16 (12)  <0.0001 \nActive smoker  1  70 (33)  36 (27)  0.35 \nKATZ functional score    0.5 \u00b1 1.8  0.9 \u00b1 2.5  0.34 \nChronic corticosteroid use  2  27 (13)  19 (14)  0.84 \nInfluenza vaccination  8  153 (74)  88 (67)  0.29 \nPneumococcal vaccination  47  102 (56)  80 (68)  0.07 \nDays of symptoms PTA  0  4.24 \u00b1 4.07  4.52 \u00b1 6.01  0.48 \nClinical admission diagnosis \nPneumonia  0  22 (10)  52 (38)  <0.0001 \nAcute exacerbation of COPD  0  68 (32)  28 (21)  0.04 \nAcute bronchitis  0  42 (20)  16 (12)  0.10 \nCongestive heart failure  0  13 (6)  7 (5)  0.89 \nAsthma  0  48 (23)  15 (11)  0.02 \nViral infection/ influenza  0  17 (8)  10 (7)  1.0 \nOther  0  2 (1)  8 (6)  0.03 \nSymptom \nNasal congestion  2  135 (64)  65 (49)  0.02 \nSputum production  0  166 (78)  107 (79)  1.0 \nDyspnea  0  198 (93)  127 (93)  1.0 \nPhysical examination finding \nConfusion  1  20 (9)  17 (13)  0.48 \nWheezes  0  138 (65)  63 (46)  0.002 \nRales  0  60 (28)  66 (49)  0.0009 \nTemperature, \u00b0C  0  37.3 \u00b1 1.0  37.6 \u00b1 1.1  0.06 \nPulse  0  101 \u00b1 19  114 \u00b1 63  0.001 \nSystolic BP, mm Hg  0  123 \u00b1 19  118 \u00b1 25  0.02 \nBMI  67  32.4 \u00b1 10.2  29.1 \u00b1 9.0  0.02 \nCURB-65 score  0  1.4 \u00b1 1.1  2.1 \u00b1 1.2  <0.0001 \nLaboratory finding \nSaO2 level, %  0  92.9 \u00b1 4.5  91.6 \u00b1 6.4  0.44 \nWBC count, \u00d7 103 cells/\u00b5L  2  9.0 \u00b1 3.8  12.5 \u00b1 6.4  <0.0001 \nNeutrophils, %  32  72 \u00b1 13  76 \u00b1 12  0.002 \nBands, %  62  2.4 \u00b1 6.6  6.0 \u00b1 10.1  0.001 \nAnion gap, mEq/L  5  8.4 \u00b1 2.4  9.8 \u00b1 3.2  <0.0001 \nBUN level, mg/dL  3  18.5 \u00b1 12.2  24.9 \u00b1 15.4  <0.0001 \nViral PCR positive    159 (75)  96 (71)  0.48 \nRadiographic finding \nNo acute disease  1  121 (57)  49 (36)  0.0005 \nInfiltrate  1  55 (26)  69 (51)  <0.0001 \n\n\nData are no. or no.

Potential antibiotic-related adverse events were significantly more common in the mixed viral-bacterial group (74 [54%], compared with 71 [33%] for viral infection alone; false-discovery rate = .002). Notably, 4 of 10 deaths among patients hospitalized with viral infection alone were secondary to complications of Clostridium difficile colitis.\nDISCUSSION\nOur study is the largest published prospective assessment of bacterial coinfection in patients with viral respiratory disease requiring hospitalization. Using comprehensive bacterial testing plus the serum biomarker PCT to define bacterial infection, our data indicate that nearly 40% of viral-associated hospitalizations have evidence of concomitant bacterial infection. Recent studies of 2009 pandemic influenza (A)H1N1 showed overall rates of bacterial coinfection of 20%\u201324% among critically ill children and adults and up to 50% among those with fatal illness [24, 25]. Much less is known regarding the bacterial complications for other viral respiratory tract infections, particularly those in adults. Our data indicates that rates and types of bacterial infections with non\u2013influenza viruses are similar to those observed with influenza. The high rate of mixed viral-bacterial infection identified in our study reflects the use of the serum biomarker PCT to augment comprehensive bacterial testing. In most previous studies reporting bacterial complications of viral infection, the bacterial testing was neither comprehensive nor systematic and frequently was left to the discretion of the clinician caring for the patient [26\u201328].\nAlthough a number of clinical and laboratory variables were associated with mixed bacterial-viral infections, the absolute differences in individual variables from hospitalizations involving viral infection alone were small and unlikely to be helpful for patient management. Nevertheless, in our study, subjects hospitalized with mixed bacterial-viral infections were more ill than those hospitalized with viral infection alone, and administration of early appropriate antibiotics to these patients is important. However, it is also noteworthy that 61% of hospitalizations involving viral infection had no evidence of bacterial infection. Most of these individuals had normal chest radiograph findings and were hemodynamically stable, yet 90% received a course of antibiotic treatment. Four deaths due to complications from C. difficile colitis occurred in this group. Once considered a nuisance, C. difficile colitis has now evolved into a deadly syndrome with high mortality rates and relapse rates of 20%\u201330% [29]. These data highlight the critical need for better methods to safely reduce unnecessary use of antibiotics.\nRecent European studies suggest that PCT-guided algorithms are a reasonable alternative to traditional microbiology-guided antibiotic therapy [15]. In 6 trials involving >2500 subjects with CAP or acute exacerbation of COPD who were randomly assigned to receive standard care or PCT-guided antibiotic treatment, there were no discernable adverse outcomes, and antibiotic use was significantly decreased, especially in those with nonpneumonic respiratory tract infections. In our study, serum PCT levels of \u22650.25 ng/mL correlated with radiographic pneumonia and higher severity of illness scores, which has been previously noted and is consistent with PCT level as a surrogate for invasive bacterial infection [30]. In addition, higher mean PCT levels were noted in patients who received a diagnosis of bacterial infections by a variety of methods, including blood and sputum cultures as well as pneumococcal urine antigen and serologic testing, suggesting that elevated PCT levels should heighten a clinician's suspicion for bacterial infection. However, PCT levels may not correlate as well with less invasive bacterial infections, such as bronchitis and acute exacerbation of COPD, and thus in some patients a low PCT level may not rule out the presence of bacterial infection [31, 32]. Although issues of bacterial colonization in this population complicate interpretation, examination of the sputum may continue to be important in patients with severe underlying lung disease.\nThis study has a number of limitations. First, our results are only applicable to adults, and the rates of mixed bacterial-viral infections may be quite different in children. In addition, our results may not be applicable to all adults admitted with respiratory tract infections, since most illnesses in our study were not severe, as reflected by the low mortality rate. The inability to obtain consent from some of the most critically ill patients may have underestimated the rate of mixed viral-bacterial infections. Also, despite vigorous attempts to collect adequate respiratory samples in a timely fashion, we were successful in only 51% of hospitalizations, also leading to underestimates of bacterial infection. Conversely, it is also possible that bacterial infection based on results of sputum cultures overestimates the incidence of infection, as it is often not possible to distinguish chronic colonization from infection even with adequate samples. Last, the presence of viral RNA may not always be causally associated with the illness leading to hospitalization. Prolonged viral detection following respiratory tract infection due to rhinovirus and other viruses can been seen, particularly when using sensitive molecular diagnostic tests.\nIn conclusion, bacterial coinfection is associated with approximately 40% of serious respiratory viral infections in adults requiring hospitalization. Patients with positive results of viral tests should be carefully evaluated for concomitant bacterial infection, and it is prudent to initiate early empirical antibiotic therapy for patients with severe viral illness or definitive radiographic pneumonia. At the present time, establishing a specific bacterial diagnosis on the basis of traditional methods remains difficult, and better bacterial diagnostic tests are needed. Future studies are needed to develop treatment algorithms that use combinations of biomarkers and clinical parameters to accurately predict patients at low risk for bacterial infection in whom antibiotics may be safely discontinued.\nNotes\nAcknowledgments.\u2003We thank John-Peter Kokkinos, for assistance in performing the PCT assays; and the Rochester General Hospital Clinical Laboratories, for assistance with sample retrieval.\nFinancial support.\u2003This work was supported by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (1R01AI079446-01).\nPotential conflicts of interest.\u2003Dr Falsey has received research grants from Medimmune/AstraZeneca and sanofipasteur and consulting fees from Medimmune/AstraZeneca, sanofipasteur, GlaxoSmithKline, and Novavax.

The recent assignment of 60 previously unknown HRV types to a third HRV species, Human rhinovirus C, raised questions about the prevalence of these picornavirus types in the community, the extent of HRV diversity at a single site, and whether the HRVs have an equally diverse clinical impact on their hosts. We quantified HRV diversity, and there was no clinical impact attributable to HRV species and genotypes among a community population of preschool-aged children with ARI who provided respiratory samples during 2003. All HRV species were represented among 138 children with ARI, and 74 distinct HRV types were cocirculating. Fever accompanied 32.8% of HRV-positive ARI cases. HRVs were less likely than DNA viruses to be codetected with another virus, suggesting virus interference at the community level, demonstrated by the inverse correlation between influenza virus detection and HRV detection.\nHuman rhinovirus, Viral epidemiology, Virus:virus interactions, Co-detections, influenza virus\nTopic: asthma fever child dna viruses genotype orthomyxoviridae picornaviridae precipitating factors respiratory tract infections rhinovirus viruses community flu-like illness host (organism) preschools\nIssue Section: Viruses\nHuman rhinovirus (HRV) infections trigger exacerbations of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and the majority of acute respiratory illnesses (ARIs), some of which meet criteria for influenza-like illness. These upper and lower respiratory tract illnesses are associated with considerable direct healthcare costs and indirect costs due to time lost from and reduced performance of regular duties [1].\nThere are 100 known HRV serotypes, with 15\u201330 circulating simultaneously at a given site [2\u20137]. Recently, 60 distinct, molecularly defined HRV genotypes were formally assigned to a third species, Human rhinovirus C (HRV-C) [8, 9]. The contribution of HRV species and individual types to the annual burden of circulating HRV is poorly defined. There are 2 apparently distinct phylogenetic clades of HRV-C when typed using the 5\u2032 untranslated region (5\u2032UTR) and adjoining encoding region [10]. It is hypothesized that these clades evolved with or without genetic recombination with Human rhinovirus A (HRV-A) types [10]. Nevertheless, each available majority sequence of an HRV-C type has to date represented a genetically unique, phylogenetically distinct, and globally distributed virus detected in patients with ARIs.\nThere are specific seasonal and annual variations in respiratory virus circulation and interactions [11\u201313]. In a retrospective pediatric hospital-based study, HRVs were found to be statistically least likely of 17 examined viruses to be codetected with another virus during 2003 [14]. This aspect of virus-to-virus interaction is described as virus interference and is hypothesized to be the result of the host's response to one virus diminishing the likelihood of infection by another virus [15, 16]. For HRVs, virus-to-virus interaction was once exploited as an in vitro diagnostic tool, whereby successful experimental HRV infection of organ cultures was indicated by blockading the replication of another, superinfecting respiratory virus [17].\nWe sought to quantify the genetic diversity, epidemiology, and impact of HRV and enterovirus species, conjointly referred to hereafter as picornaviruses, circulating among a community cohort of preschool-aged children who provided respiratory samples over a 1-year period. We also sought to build on our hospital-based virus-to-virus interaction analyses [14] by seeking preliminary observational evidence of virus interference within the community.\nMETHODS\nCommunity-Based Cohort Study\nAfter receipt of informed consent from the parent or guardian of a potential study subject, we enrolled 234 healthy children <5 years of age into a community-based dynamic cohort study conducted over 12 months in Melbourne, Australia [1]. The study commenced in January 2003, and enrollment was progressive and continued until November 2003, with children observed until January 2004. Parents monitored a set of symptoms in the study child each day, and when the definition of ARI was met we asked parents to collect a combined nose-throat swab specimen [18]. The specimen was couriered to the Victorian Infectious Diseases Reference Laboratory, where it underwent conventional polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing, with reverse-transcription PCR performed for RNA viruses, including influenza A and B viruses, respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza viruses, HRVs, and enteroviruses [19]. PCR was conducted for adenoviruses [19]. Illnesses were classified as ARIs uncomplicated or complicated by fever and/or otitis media.\nAt the completion of data collection, we transported all available specimens (original nose-throat swab specimens and complementary DNA) on dry ice to the Queensland Paediatric Infectious Diseases (Qpid) Laboratory, where they were tested for metapneumovirus and coronavirus NL63 (hereafter, \u201ccoronavirus\u201d), using real-time PCR [19].\nTemplate Preparation and Conventional PCR\nHRV templates for PCR amplification at the Qpid Laboratory were complementary DNA, created at the Victorian Infectious Diseases Reference Laboratory during the original studies [19], or fresh RNA extracted by means of the Corbett X-tractor Gene system (Corbett Research, Australia) from the original nose-throat swab specimen. All extracts were amplified using a broadly reactive screening assay that targets the 5\u2032UTR [20], yielding amplicons (length, approximately 380 base pairs) for sequencing by the PRISM BigDye sequencing kit v3.1 (Applied Biosystems). Sequences generated by this study and submitted to GenBank included accession numbers JN861783-92 and JQ406000-184.\nHRV Species Designations\nSequence analysis was conducted in Geneious Pro [21]. The picornavirus species was determined by best match, using the following algorithm: when a basic local alignment search tool (BLAST) comparison returned matches with \u226595% sequence identity in the 5\u2032UTR, with characterized members assigned to a given species, our sequence was assigned to that species. For viruses not classified at this stage, we used definitive 5\u2032UTR-derived data from Lee et al [22] as a guide to classify any query sequence that shared >96% nucleotide identity in the 5\u2032UTR with a BLAST match as a variant of that HRV type.\nStatistical Analysis\nCounts and proportions were recorded for descriptive analyses. Similar to methods we described previously [14], univariate analysis involving the \u03c72 test or the Fisher exact test, using 2 \u00d7 2 contingency tables, was used to evaluate the relationships between picornavirus type, season, and demographic variables, such as age and sex, as well as to study virus codetection with another virus. A P value of <.05 was considered to indicate a statistically significant association.\nRESULTS\nCommunity-Based Cohort Study\nWe observed 56 397 child-days in just over 12 study months. There were 730 ARIs identified; in 563 cases (74%), at least 1 parent-collected combined nose-throat swab specimen was returned [18]. For 269 ARIs (274 specimens; 47.8% of specimens), HRV or enterovirus was identified by conventional PCR at Victorian Infectious Diseases Reference Laboratory [19].\nScreening, Sequencing, and Genotype Assignment\nOf 274 specimens previously positive for a picornavirus and shipped to Qpid Laboratory, 238 (86.9%) yielded a genotypable sequence (Figure 1), 14 (5.1%) yielded uninterpretable sequences, and 22 (8.0%) yielded sequences that were not amplifiable [20]. The picornavirus-positive specimens originated from 138 children (mean age, 25.7 months), including 48 from infants (age, 1\u201312 months), 107 from toddlers (age, 12\u201324 months), and 119 from older children (age, 2\u20135 years). A mean of 1.8 picornaviruses (range, 0\u20136) were detected per child. Sixty picornavirus-positive children (43.5%) had \u22652 picornaviruses detected during study participation, and 32 had \u22653 (Table 1 and Figure 2). No child was positive for the same HRV type during different ARI episodes, although the same species might have been detected. Of the genotyped viruses, 99 (41.5%) were HRV-A, 13 (5.5%) were Human rhinovirus B (HRV-B), 113 (47.5%) were HRV-C, and 13 (5.5%) were enteroviruses (Figure 1).\nTable 1.\nCharacteristics of Picornavirus (PV)\u2013Positive Specimens\nCharacteristic HRV-A HRV-B HRV-C Enterovirus Untypable Overall (n = 563)\nMale sex, (%)  48 (48.5)  9 (69.2)  58 (51.4)  53.8  35.7  48.0 \nViral detections, no.  99  13  113  13  \u2026  395 \nAge, months, average  23.5  30.8  25.4  31.7  27.1  19.9 \nPeak seasona  Autumn  Autumn  Winter  Winter  Autumn, Spring  Winter \nPeak monthsb  May, Octc  Apr, May  Jun, Jul, Oct  Mar, Jun, Jul  May, Oct, Nov  Jun, Aug \nPeak codetection month  Jul, Sep, Dec  Jun  Jun  Jun, Jul, Oct  \u2026  \u2026 \nWheeze  0  0  2 (0.4)  1 (0.2)  3 (0.5)  54 (9.6) \nARI, no fever, no OM  57 (10.1)  7 (1.2)  73 (12.9)  4 (0.7)  9 (1.6)  277 (49.2) \nARI with fever  32 (5.7)  4 (0.7)  34 (6.0)  9 (1.6)  3 (0.5)  220 (39.1) \nARI with OM, no fever  1 (0.2)  1 (0.2)  2 (0.4)  0  2 (0.4)  46 (8.2) \nARI with fever and OM  9 (1.6)  1 (0.2)  4 (0.7)  0  0  20 (3.6) \nChildren with 2 PVs            28 (4.9) \nChildren with 3 PVs            17 (3.0) \nChildren with 4 PVs            10 (1.8) \nChildren with 5 PVs            3 (0.5) \nChildren with 6 PVs            2 (0.3) \nData are no.

HRV-C was more common in winter than HRV-A (P = .624).\nClinical and Demographic Features and Picornavirus Type\nPicornavirus species distributions were not associated with sex (Table 1). There was a decreased likelihood of identifying any of the picornavirus species in infants and an increased risk of identifying HRV-B, HRV-C, and enteroviruses in older children (P < .05 for these associations). The proportion of ARI episodes in which HRV-B and HRV-C were detected was lowest during summer, while the proportion of ARI episodes in which HRV-A was detected was lowest in both summer and winter (Figure 3). Detection of each HRV species declined dramatically when detection of respiratory syncytial virus and metapneumovirus increased and detection of influenza A virus peaked (in August [19]). HRV-A and HRV-C could be detected in subsequent ARI specimens from the same child, but HRV-B positivity did not recur for any child. Peak picornavirus activity occurred in May and October, approximately 2 weeks after school terms commenced. Activity of the species were observed to peak distinctly (species exchange) during the course of the year.\nHRV-positive ARI cases were accompanied by fever in 84 instances (14.9% of all ARIs; 30.7% of HRV detections; Table 2), whereas the majority of cases (9 [69.2%] of 13) in which enterovirus types (including coxsackievirus A1, A2, A4, and B5; echovirus 3, 11, 18, 21, and 27; and poliovirus 1) were identified had fever reported. Only 5 cases of wheeze were reported: 2 were associated with HRV-C, 1 was associated with enterovirus, and 2 were associated with untypable picornaviruses. Otitis media without fever accompanied ARI in 4 picornavirus-positive instances (0.7%), and fever and otitis media co-occurred with ARI in 14 instances (2.5%). HRV-A, HRV-B, and HRV-C were detected in similar proportions of ARI cases with complications (42.0%, 46.2%, and 36.8% respectively) and those without complications (58.0%, 53.8%, and 63.2% respectively).\nTable 2.\nMeasures of Association Between Virus Pairs in Which Codetections Occurred\nVariable PV AdV\nPIV\nRSV\nIFAV\nMPV\nCoV\nTotal detections, no.  252  45  33  37  25  33  19 \nSingle detections,a no.  213  20  23  37  21  22  9 \nCodetections,b no.  39  25  10  4  4  11  10 \n    OR (95% CI)  P  OR (95% CI)  P  OR (95% CI)  P  OR (95% CI)  P  OR (95% CI)  P  OR (95% CI)  P \nPV  \u2026  1.077 (.568\u20132.039)  .8790  0.443 (.195\u2013.983)  .0370  0.027 (.001\u2013.184)  <.0001  0.150 (.035\u2013.532)  <.0001  0.324 (.133\u2013.761)  .0050  0.712 (.249\u20131.979)  .6400 \nAdV  \u2026  \u2026    0.731 (.117\u20133.291)  >.999  .272 (.14\u20131.907)  .237  0 (0\u20132.247)  .249  1.645 (.466\u20135.239)  .324  0 (0\u20133.033)  .388 \nPIV  \u2026  \u2026    \u2026    0 (0\u20131.838)  .159  0.659 (.032\u20134.818)  >.999  0.486 (.024\u20133.497)  .712  0 (0\u20134.281)  .619 \nRSV  \u2026  \u2026    \u2026    \u2026    0 (0\u20132.493)  0.245  0.383 (.019\u20132.724)  .500  0.7 (.034\u20135.176)  >.999 \nIFAV  \u2026  \u2026    \u2026    \u2026    \u2026    0 (1\u20136.167)  1.000  1.204 (.058\u20139.164)  .584 \nMPV  \u2026  \u2026    \u2026    \u2026    \u2026    \u2026    1.947 (.296\u20139.386)  .307 \nData were determined by 2 \u00d7 2 contingency tables with the Fisher exact test.

Among 252 picornavirus-positive specimens, 39 (15.5%) were PCR positive for another virus; 213 (84.5%) were not detected with another virus. Only respiratory syncytial virus was codetected with another virus on fewer occasions (9.8% of respiratory syncytial virus detections). Despite this, among children with \u22651 HRV detection during enrollment (28 children had 2 PVs; 17 had 3 PVs; 10 had 4 PVs, 3 had 5 PVs and 2 had 6 PVs), there was a consistent pattern of a reduced likelihood of codetection with a number of other viruses. For example, an HRV detection was associated with a reduced likelihood of codetecting any of 5 viruses or virus groups (adenovirus, parainfluenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus, influenza A virus, metapneumovirus, or coronavirus), as reflected by an odds ratio of <1 (Table 2). Among picornaviruses, enterovirus was most frequently associated with codetection (31% of enterovirus detections), and HRV-B was least frequently associated with codetection (8% of HRV-B detections). There was an average of 50 days between consecutive ARIs in study children. After each HRV, influenza A virus, respiratory syncytial virus, or adenovirus detection, there was a mean interval of 46, 51, 60, and 45 days, respectively, before the next ARI episode.\nMost picornaviruses were detected in toddlers (61 [44.2%] of picornavirus-positive children) and children aged 2\u20135 years (58 [42.0%]). Picornavirus was most often codetected in infants and toddlers (15 [12.3%] in each age group). Respiratory syncytial virus was involved in the fewest codetections (4 [10.3%] of respiratory syncytial virus\u2013positive children), while adenovirus (25 [55.6%] of adenovirus-positive children) and coronavirus (10 [52.6%] of coronavirus-positive children) were involved in the most. The appearance and disappearance of influenza A virus detection coincided with the disappearance and appearance of picornaviruses, respectively.\nDISCUSSION\nOur analysis of ARIs among children in the community identified 74 named or uncharacterized rhinovirus types among 138 children followed during this 12-month study. Three-to-five times more distinct HRV types were identified in our single-year cohort than would have been expected from the literature. Recently, van der Zalm et al identified 27 different subtypes among a cohort of 18 children sampled fortnightly during a six-month period [7]. Because a lower sequence threshold was used to identify those viruses, it is likely that the true number of HRV types was underestimated as compared to the higher threshold (96% vs 90%) we applied, which we considered essential when using the highly conserved 5\u2032UTR region. Recent cohort studies that also used the 5\u2032UTR for HRV typing identified 56 [23] distinct HRV types, including 32 new types [23], whereas other cohort studies have not conducted detailed typing analyses [24, 25]. Cohorts with longer follow-up [26] or more-frequent sampling than ours [27] unsurprisingly find greater numbers of HRV types since they span multiple seasons or have a better likelihood of sampling so-called \u201casymptomatic\u201d infections. Frequently, sampling in longitudinal cohort studies improves our understanding of the role of respiratory viruses in illness because it allows temporal association with signs and symptoms.\nDespite the dominance of HRV-C types here and their reported links with asthma elsewhere [28], few new cases of wheezing were reported in our cohort, most likely because of exclusion of children with chronic pulmonary disorders (including diagnosed asthma or frequent use of asthma medication). A frequently sampled, well-controlled longitudinal cohort of children with asthma will be required to answer whether there is a species-specific HRV impact in an asthmatic population. All HRV species were represented among ARI cases with fever, providing further evidence of the confounding capacity of HRV infections during an influenza epidemic or pandemic unless specific diagnostics are included.\nMost respiratory viruses were detected in toddlers and children, from whom the majority of specimens were obtained. In our study, the respiratory syncytial virus and metapneumovirus season preceded the influenza A virus season. It was also noteworthy that HRV prevalence declined sharply as respiratory syncytial virus, metapneumovirus, and, particularly, influenza A virus cases peaked. This mirrored the findings from our hospital studies, conducted on specimens from Brisbane, Queensland, Australia, that were also collected during 2003 [14].\nWe observed that viruses with an RNA genome, in particular the HRVs, were less frequently involved in codetections than those with a DNA genome in this community cohort from Victoria. These numbers might have been different if other virus, such as bocavirus, parainfluenza virus-4, and influenza C virus, had been included, but our previous findings suggest the adjustment would not have changed the significance of the virus-to-virus interaction [14]. Our observation most likely reflects the capacity of RNA viruses to efficiently trigger the early innate interferon response through interactions with a range of pattern-recognition receptors, including Toll-like receptors 3 and 8, MDA5, and RIG-I. Whether DNA viruses are better adapted to interfere with a host interferon response or are better at exploiting the opportunities provided by RNA viruses remains to be defined.\nIt has been previously suggested that the 5\u2032UTR is unsuitable for HRV genotyping because in silico signs suggest that the region has, at some point, been a site for recombination between some HRV types [29]. However, we have not found, nor has there been published evidence for, false genotyping (a 5\u2032UTR erroneously representing a polyprotein sequence from a different virus) of the \u2265100 HRV-A, HRV-B, and HRV-C genomes fully sequenced to date. Even when an HRV-C type falls into the HRV-A clade phylogenetically, to date it exists within a distinct space in that clade. Carefully chosen sequence identity thresholds and experience can successfully produce robust genotyping results, as has been shown here and elsewhere in the literature [23, 26, 27, 30\u201332]. In this study, we found that each 5\u2032UTR sequence was a unique identifier of HRV type. Others suggest the HRVs are under positive selective pressure to remain conserved [33]. While this may not remain evident as more completed HRV genomes become available, no proof exists to support a theory that the 5\u2032UTR is an unsatisfactory target for genotyping, and it continues to be used successfully elsewhere [34]. Nevertheless, phylogeny based on the 5\u2032UTR region, whether partial or complete, does not accurately discriminate all members of the HRV-A species from those currently considered to be HRV-C but harboring elements of an HRV-A UTR [10]. This is similar to the phylogenetic patterns of enterovirus types derived from use of the 5\u2032UTR, in which the 4 known species are represented by only 2 clades. A longer target encompassing a 5\u2032UTR-VP2 stretch improves phylogenetic tree construction, and these sequences are becoming well represented in the GenBank sequence database [35]. However, until the HRV virome is completely characterized, it is also premature to assume that the 5\u2032UTR-VP2 region's apparent congruity with the rest of an HRV's polyprotein sequence will be maintained by the genomes of future distinct HRV strains. A VP1 target is less sensitive when used directly on clinical specimens [22] and is likely to underrepresent enterovirus diversity [36].\nIn summary, our screening and 5\u2032UTR-based genotyping study identified extensive HRV genetic diversity as compared to data generated from culture-based diagnostics. There were no associations between sex or clinical outcome and HRV species, but HRVs were less often present in codetections than would have been expected by chance. In particular, the influenza A virus season preceded a precipitous decline in HRV detections. Whether a reduction in HRVs allows an increase in other viruses during the winter months is unknown, and studies to define the immunobiological mechanisms behind these observations are required.\nNotes\nAcknowledgments.\u2003We thank the families and children who participated in this study; Kelly Allen, other VIRGo staff, Maternal and Child Health nurses, and Victorian Infectious Diseases Reference Laboratory and Qpid Laboratory staff who assisted with the original study; and Chloe McIntyre, Peter Simmonds, and Wai-Ming Lee for valuable discussions.\nFinancial support.\u2003This work was supported by the National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC; project grant 455905) and the Queensland Children's Medical Research Institute (project grant 10281).

A total of 408 nasopharyngeal aspirate samples were obtained from 103 patients over a 1-year period. Samples positive for HCoV were submitted for nucleotide sequencing to determine the species. Nineteen samples (4.65%) were positive for HCoV, of which 8 were positive for NL63, 6 for OC43, 4 for HKU1, and 1 for 229E. Identification of HCoV was not associated with an increased rate of respiratory exacerbations, but NL63-positive patients had higher exacerbation rates than patients who were positive for other HCoV species.\nIssue Section: Viruses\nCystic fibrosis (CF) is an autosomal inherited disease characterized by recurrent and chronic respiratory infections [1]. The role of respiratory viruses in the progression of lung disease in CF is still controversial, although infection with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and influenza viruses was shown to carry a significant risk for respiratory exacerbations and hospital admissions [2].\nWhile little is known of the impact of newly described respiratory viruses on lung disease in CF patients, there is evidence that some of these viruses may be more aggressive than others. For example, we recently showed that infection with human rhinovirus C is associated with an increased risk of respiratory exacerbations [3].\nHuman coronaviruses (HCoVs) were initially described in the 1960s as the causative agents of upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs). Although reports of lower respiratory tract infections caused by HCoVs were identified thereafter [4], the coronaviruses were still mainly considered to be the causative agents of URTIs [5] until 2002, when a new coronavirus, later named SARS coronavirus, was identified during an outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome [6]. More recently, other coronaviruses were described, with HCoV-NL63 identified in the Netherlands in 2004 [7] and HCoV-HKU1 in Hong Kong in 2005 [8]. These novel HCoV species were hypothesized to cause lower respiratory tract infections at a higher frequency than the previously known HCoVs [9], although recent data suggest that HCoV-HKU1 does not cause a significantly higher proportion of LRTIs than that observed with HCoV-OC43 [10].\nIn this study, we aimed to investigate the clinical impact of all 4 circulating HCoVs (OC43, 229E, HKU1, and NL63) in pediatric patients with CF who attended an outpatient clinic during routine and exacerbation visits.\nMETHODS\nA total of 103 CF patients (49 females, 54 males; median age, 8.9 years [range, 3.8 months to 17.8 years]) were enrolled in this study from 6 September 2006 through 4 September 2007. Nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPAs) or nasal blow (NB) specimens for viral investigation, as well as sputum or oropharyngeal samples for microbiology cultures, were collected during scheduled or unscheduled visits on 408 occasions, with a median ( \u00b1 SD) of 4 \u00b1 1.74 visits (range, 1\u20139 visits) per patient.\nThe local ethics committee approved the study protocol, and all parents/guardians gave informed consent for their children to participate in the study.\nClinical and functional data were obtained at all visits. Exacerbation of respiratory disease was defined as the presence of \u22652 of the following symptoms and signs: fever, increase in the amount of secretion or cough intensity, change in the sputum's aspect, worsening of dyspnea, loss of appetite, a decrease of \u226510% in forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1), and weight loss.\nTotal nucleic acids were extracted from nasopharyngeal samples with the QIAmp Viral RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hamburg, Germany), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Reverse transcription was performed with a High Capacity cDNA Archive Kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA), using 20 \u00b5L of previously extracted RNA. Identification of respiratory viruses was performed by individual polymerase chain reactions (PCRs) targeting RSV; influenza viruses A and B; human parainfluenza viruses 1, 2, and 3; HCoV; human metapneumovirus; adenovirus; human bocavirus; enteroviruses; and the \u03b2-actin gene, as previously described [3]. The analytical sensitivity of this assay for HCoV detection, determined by quantified plasmid standards, was 100 copies per reaction.\nAll coronavirus-positive samples were confirmed by means of 1-step reverse transcription\u2013heminested PCR, using primers CoV2A-F (CTTATGGGTTGGGATTATCC) and CoV2A-R (TAATAACAGACAACGCCATCATC) for the first round and the inner primers CoV2A-Rnest a (CCATCATCACTCAGAATCATCA) and CoV2A-Rnest b (CCATCATCAGAAAGAATCATCA), which generate a 404\u2013base pair amplicon from the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) gene. Nucleotide sequencing was performed using dye terminator chemistry (Applied Biosystems). Nucleic acid alignment was conducted on the basis of the amino acid code by use of the BLOSUM algorithm. Phylogenetic classification was performed using the neighbor-joining method, with the percentage distance substitution model and bootstrap values calculated from 1000 replicates with MEGA 5.0 software (www.megasoftware.net). The nucleotide sequences of the partial RdRp gene of the HCoV identified in this study were submitted to GenBank (accession numbers: JN251784 - JN251802).\nThe results were expressed as medians or percentages, unless stated otherwise. Categorical variables were analyzed by \u03c72 or Fisher exact tests. The age differences between patients with and patients without HCoV or within HCoV species were compared by nonparametric Kruskal\u2013Wallis tests. The proportion of cases with acute respiratory exacerbation among patients infected with different HCoV species was compared by \u03c72 or Fisher exact tests.\nLogistic regression was used to determine whether infection with HCoV in general or with one particular HCoV species was independently associated with respiratory exacerbation or hospital admission. To account for correlations among samples within the same subject, binomial generalized linear models were used. All analyses were performed using SPSS for Windows (version 18; SPSS, Chicago, IL), and the level of statistical significance was set at .05.\nRESULTS\nAt least 1 respiratory virus was identified in 203 of 408 samples (49.7%), with rhinovirus being the main identified agent (in 139 samples [34.1%]). HCoVs were identified in 19 samples (4.65%) from 17 patients (11 males and 6 females). As shown in Figure 1, 8 of the viruses were NL63, 6 were OC43, 4 were HKU1, and 1 was 229E. Two patients had 2 separate identifications of HCoV in samples collected 2 and 6 months apart, respectively, and different species were identified on each occasion. Single HCoV infections were found on 13 occasions, while coinfections were observed on 6 occasions, four with the identification of 2 viruses (rhinovirus or enterovirus) and two with 3 viruses identified (RSV + rhinovirus and influenza A virus + enterovirus).\nFigure 1.\nOpen in new tabDownload slide\nRepresentative neighbor-joining phylogenetic tree of a partial RNA-dependent RNA polymerase region of coronavirus (CoV), generated with a p-Distance model on the basis of a 134-amino acid sequence by use of MEGA 5.0 software (available at: http://www.megasofware.net). Reference CoV species data were obtained from the GenBank database. Viruses identified in this study are indicated in boldface and labeled VFC. Bootstrap values >70% in the key branches are depicted. Scale bar indicates amino acid substitutions per site. The strain designations, GenBank accession numbers, and corresponding hosts are indicated. The respective genera are given on the right. The highly conserved amino acid sequence fragment did not permit differentiation of the 2 NL63 CoV clusters.\nOverall, 142 episodes (34.8%) of respiratory exacerbations were identified, and hospital admissions occurred in 31 (7.6%) of them. Significant associations were found for an increased risk of respiratory exacerbation when rhinovirus C was identified and an increased risk of hospital admission with influenza virus infections (data not shown). No significant difference was found among patients with HCoV infection, with exacerbations identified on 6 of 19 occasions (31.5%) and hospital admissions on 2 of 19 occasions (10.5%).\nThe HCoV species that were found are displayed in Table 1, as are patient characteristics, including the frequency of symptoms and the clinical status at the time of the visit. The age distribution was similar among patients infected with different HCoV species, although a significant difference was found among the ages of patients without viral infections and those infected with HCoV or other viruses (Table 1). Although no significant differences were seen concerning reported symptoms and clinical findings among patients infected with different HCoV species, a significantly greater respiratory exacerbation rate was found among patients infected with HCoV-NL63 as compared to those infected with other HCoV species (P = .04). In the logistic regression model, however, neither the identification of any HCoV nor HCoV-NL63 specifically could be demonstrated as being significantly associated with a respiratory exacerbation.\nTable 1.\nClinical Characteristics, According to the Virological Results, for 408 Clinical Visits Involving 103 Children With Cystic Fibrosis\nHCoV-NL63 (n = 8) HCoV-OC43 (n = 6) HCoV-HKU1 (n = 4) Any HCoVa (n = 19) Other Viruses (n = 184) No Virus (n = 205)\nMedian age (mo)  \u200267.96  \u200266.95  \u200373.46  \u200277.46  \u2003\u200289.40  119.00b \nMale sex  6 (75)  5 (83.3)  2 (50)  13 (68.4)  106 (57.6)  101 (49.3) \nLack of appetite  2 (25)  2 (33.3)  0  4 (21)  28 (15.2)  22 (10.7) \nWeight loss  1 (12.5)  1 (16.6)  0  2 (10.5)  23 (12.5)  28 (13.6) \nIncrease of amount of sputum  5 (62.5)  1 (16.6)  0  6 (31.5)  73 (39.6)  60 (29.2) \nChange of sputum's aspect  4 (50)  \u20030  0  4 (21)  43 (23.3)  29 (14.1) \nWorsening of dyspnea  2 (25)  1 (16.6)  0  3 (15.8)  41 (22.3)  38 (18.5) \nFEV1 decrease (\u226510%)c  \u20030  \u20030  0  1 (5.3)  11 (5.9)  17 (8.3) \nFever  1 (12.5)  \u20030  0  1 (5.3)  23 (12.5)  25 (12.2) \nCoryza  5 (62.5)  2 (33.3)  1 (25)  9 (47.4)  59 (32.1)  41 (20) \nSore throat  2 (25)  1 (16.7)  0  3 (15.8)  18 (9.8)  15 (7.3) \nDiarrhea  \u20030  \u20030  0  1 (5.3)  7 (3.8)  11 (5.4) \nWheezing  \u20030  \u20030  0  \u20030  16 (8.7)  12 (5.9) \nStridor  \u20030  \u20030  0  \u20030  1 (0.5)  1 (0.5) \nExacerbation  5 (62.5)  1 (16.7)  0  6 (31.6)  72 (39.1)  64 (31.2) \nAdmission  1 (12.5)  1 (16.7)  0  2 (10.5)  16 (8.7)  13 (6.3) \nData are no.

While no significant clinical impact could be attributed to infection with these species as a whole, the identification of HCoV-NL63 was associated with a significantly higher rate of respiratory exacerbation as compared to other HCoV species.\nAlthough HCoVs were previously identified as causative agents of lower respiratory tract infections, the medical community commonly knew them as \u201ccommon cold\u201d viruses. The identification of new species of HCoV [7, 8] and the emergence of SARS HCoV [6] highlighted the potential role of these viruses as causative agents of severe lower respiratory tract infections. Following initial descriptions of these new \u201cnon-SARS\u201d HCoV, several other studies describing the prevalence and clinical impact were published, although results were conflicting. While the prevalence values of these new HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 oscillate from 0.4% to 9% [5], reports of severe cases of lower respiratory infections were described in Australia for the HCoV-NL63 [11] and in Germany for the HCoV-HKU1 [12].\nHowever, most of the studies on the clinical impact of different HCoV species were only performed among children who were hospitalized for acute respiratory tract infections, with small sample sizes and short periods of sample collection [10]. More recent studies have included much larger samples. Gaunt et al. [9], who studied 11 600 respiratory samples obtained between 2006 and 2009 in Edinburgh, United Kingdom, found at least 1 coronavirus in 2.3% of the samples, with marked predominance in winter months. Although they found a significant number of coinfections (mainly with RSV), single infections with HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63, and HCoV-HKU1 were specifically associated with lower respiratory tract disease. They also observed that HCoV-229E, which was identified in a smaller proportion of samples, was predominant among immunosuppressed patients. Talbot et al. [10] used molecular tools to determine the incidence and clinical features of upper and lower respiratory tract infections that are associated with HCoV-NL63, HCoV-OC43, and HCoV-229E during a 20-year period and showed that HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-NL63 were associated with a significant burden of lower respiratory tract infections in previously healthy outpatient children who manifested with clinical syndromes, such as pneumonia and bronchiolitis, that were similar to those caused by other respiratory viruses [10].\nPatients with CF represent a specific population that is susceptible to more severe clinical manifestations of respiratory infections overall, because of limitations in mucocilliary transport and anatomic distortions of the bronchial tree that facilitate the retention and infection of respiratory secretions. The impact of respiratory viruses in CF lung disease has been recently reassessed using molecular methods by some researchers, with conflicting results: while Olesen et al [13] reported a lack of significant clinical impact of viral infections in lung function or respiratory symptoms, Wat et al [2] described an association of viral infections with respiratory exacerbations in CF children, particularly when influenza A virus, influenza B virus, and rhinovirus infections were identified.\nOne possible explanation for the differential clinical impact of respiratory viruses for CF patients is the baseline lung function, and it is possible that patients with worse lung disease would be at more risk to present an exacerbation; we cannot rule out this possibility in the present study, because of the small number of patients infected with HCoV. Another hypothesis is related to the mechanisms of disease of HCoV. Both SARS coronavirus and HCoV-NL63 use the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as the main pathway for attachment and entry. Following infection, a substantial reduction of the ACE2 expression in the cell surfaces occurs [14], but the rate and the intensity of this downregulation seems to be much lower in HCoV-NL63 infections as compared to SARS coronavirus infections. ACE2 downregulation was previously shown to be associated with an increase of the inflammatory process in the respiratory tract and may be one of the determinants of severity in acute respiratory distress syndrome [14]. Moreover, genetic polymorphisms associated with an increase of ACE expression (which counterbalance ACE2 action as a proinflammatory mediator) were shown to be associated with worse lung disease in CF patients [15].\nWe have previously shown that human rhinovirus C infections were associated with an increased risk of respiratory exacerbations in CF children [3], and although we could not identify a significant association of HCoV infections with respiratory exacerbations in the present analysis, such exacerbations were observed in a significant proportion (62.5%) of HCoV-NL63\u2013infected children. It should be mentioned that the mean age of our patients was approximately 9 years, while in the study by Talbot et al. [10], the greatest incidence of LRI associated with these viruses occurred between 6 and 23 months of age. Therefore, a study of infants with CF could produce very different results.\nIn conclusion, we found all circulating species of HCoV in children with CF who were enrolled in this study. Symptoms were mainly related to the upper airway, and we did not find an association between HCoV infections in general or infections with a given HCoV species and an increased risk of respiratory exacerbation or hospital admission, although a significantly higher rate of respiratory exacerbation was observed among HCoV-NL63\u2013infected children as compared to children infected by other coronaviruses.\nNotes\nFinancial support.\u2003This work was supported by Funda\u00e7\u00e3o de Amparo \u00e0 Pesquisa do Estado de S\u00e3o Paulo (grant 05/01625-8).\nPotential conflicts of interest.\u2003All authors: No reported conflicts.\nAll authors have submitted the ICMJE Form for Disclosure of Potential Conflicts of Interest.

Pandemic H1N1 (pdmH1N1) influenza A virus caused massive infection in 2009 and currently circulates worldwide. Avian influenza A H9N2 (H9N2/G1) virus has infected humans and has the potential to be the next pandemic virus. Antiviral function and immunomodulatory role of MBL in pdmH1N1 and H9N2/G1 virus infection have not been investigated.\nMethods.\u2003In this study, MBL wild-type (WT) and MBL knockout (KO) murine models were used to examine the role of MBL in pdmH1N1 and H9N2/G1 virus infection.\nResults.\u2003Our study demonstrated that in vitro, MBL binds to pdmH1N1 and H9N2/G1 viruses, likely via the carbohydrate recognition domain of MBL. Wild-type mice developed more severe disease, as evidenced by a greater weight loss than MBL KO mice during influenza virus infection. Furthermore, MBL WT mice had enhanced production of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines compared with MBL KO mice, suggesting that MBL could upregulate inflammatory responses that may potentially worsen pdmH1N1 and H9N2/G1 virus infections.\nConclusions.\u2003Our study provided the first in vivo evidence that MBL may be a risk factor during pdmH1N1 and H9N2/G1 infection by upregulating proinflammatory response.\nTopic: cytokine mannose binding lectin lung weight reduction chemokines aves orthomyxoviridae virus diseases infections mice viruses inflammatory response pandemics influenza a virus, h1n1 subtype swine influenza binding (molecular function)\nIssue Section: Viruses\nThe pandemic H1N1 2009 (pdmH1N1) influenza A virus has spread globally since the outbreak first started in Mexico in 2009. As of August 2010, the virus had already caused more than 18 449 deaths in at least 214 countries worldwide [1]. The World Health Organization officially announced the step-down of pdmH1N1 to postpandemic phase on 10 August 2010, and the virus was expected to circulate as a seasonal virus in the human population thereafter [2]. Gene segments of the pdmH1N1 virus are derived from multiple lineages, including the Eurasian swine, the classical swine, and the triple reassortant swine lineages. Multiple genetic reassortment events of viral components have taken place and thus gave rise to this novel pandemic virus [3]. Clinical symptoms of pdmH1N1 infection are usually mild, possibly due to the cross-protection offered by memory cytotoxic T lymphocytes established from previous exposure to seasonal influenza [4].\nH9N2 avian influenza virus (H9N2/G1) is widely prevalent among poultry in various Eurasian regions, including mainland China and Hong Kong. In 1999 and 2003, H9N2 influenza was reported in 3 children in Hong Kong. All 3 of them developed relatively mild symptoms and recovered within a week [5, 6]. The 6 internal genes of H9N2/G1 virus were found to be related to the highly pathogenic avian influenza virus A/Hong Kong/483/97 (H5N1). Although the H9N2/G1 virus was found mainly in poultry, it has the ability to transmit across species, and with its genetic similarity to the highly pathogenic H5N1, it also poses a threat of becoming pandemic [7].\nMannose-binding lectin (MBL) is a serum protein primarily produced by the liver. It belongs to the collectin family that comprises the collagen-like domain and the carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD). MBL functions as a key pattern-recognition molecule recognizing a wide range of pathogens [8, 9]. Lectin pathway activation [10] and opsonophagocytosis are triggered upon MBL binding to pathogens [11]. While the MBL gene is highly polymorphic in humans, clinical association studies have demonstrated that MBL deficiency was associated with increased susceptibility to certain infections [12, 13].\nThe antiviral role of MBL in influenza virus infection remains controversial. Previous studies suggested that MBL demonstrates in vitro anti-influenza virus function, including inhibition of viral hemagglutination and direct neutralization of the virus either in a complement dependent or independent manner [14\u201316]. However, other studies have shown that the antiviral function of MBL may vary among different strains of influenza viruses, depending on the number of potential glycosylation sites on the viral hemagglutinin (HA) globular domain [17, 18]. Influenza virus\u2013infected epithelial cells and macrophages can initiate a cell-specific response that includes the transcription and release of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines [19, 20]. Although some studies have indicated that MBL may regulate proinflammatory cytokine and chemokine release from phagocytes in response to bacterial stimulation [21, 22], little is known about its immunomodulatory role in influenza [23].\nIn the present study, we investigated whether MBL could display any in vitro or in vivo antiviral function toward pdmH1N1 and H9N2/G1 viruses, as well as whether it could modulate the inflammatory response upon infection by these two strains of influenza virus.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nCells and Viruses\nInfluenza virus A/California/04/2009 (pdmH1N1) were propagated in embryonated chicken eggs and purified by ultracentrifugation with minor modification of our previous work [4, 24]. Influenza virus A/Quail/Hong Kong/G1/97 (H9N2/G1) was grown in Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells with modified Eagle\u2019s medium (Invitrogen) containing 2 \u03bcg/mL N-p-Tosyl-L-phenylalanine chloromethyl ketone (TPCK)\u2013treated trypsin (Sigma-Aldrich). Virus stocks were purified by adsorption to and elution from turkey red blood cells and stored at \u221280\u00b0C until use as previously described [25]. The determination of virus titer was performed by titrating virus in MDCK cells, with daily observation of cytopathic effect and confirmation by hemagglutination assay. The tissue culture infective dose affecting 50% of the cultures (TCID50) was calculated by the Reed-Muench formula. Ultraviolet (UV)\u2013irradiated virus was prepared by irradiation with energy of 0.2 J in a UV crosslinker as described previously [26].\nBinding of Recombinant Human MBL to Influenza Virus\nThe binding assay was performed as described previously [12]. In brief, 96-well flat-bottom polystyrene plates (Corning-Costar) were precoated with 100 \u03bcL/well of 102, 103,104, and 105 TCID50 UV-irradiated influenza viruses or phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). After incubation at room temperature overnight, wells were blocked for 2 hours at room temperature with 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in PBS with 0.05% sodium azide. Different concentrations of recombinant human MBL (rhMBL) (0, 0.5, 2, 6, or 8 \u03bcg/mL), which was kindly provided by Dr K. Takahashi (Laboratory of Developmental Immunology, Harvard Department of Pediatrics, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston), were added and incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C. Then 100 \u03bcL of 0.2 \u03bcg/mL biotinylated monoclonal anti-MBL antibody (HYB131-01, Antibody Shop) diluted in PBS with 1% BSA was added into each well. Bound antibody was detected by using horseradish peroxidase\u2013conjugated streptavidin and tetramethybenzidine substrate solution (R&D Systems). The binding of MBL to influenza virus was evaluated by the absolute absorbance values measured at 450 nm (A450).\nMice and Virus Infection\nBreeding pairs of MBL wild-type (WT) and MBL knockout (KO) mice on C57B6/J were provided by Dr Takahashi [27]. They were maintained under specific pathogen-free conditions in the animal facilities of the Laboratory Animal Unit, The University of Hong Kong. Female mice were used at 6\u201310 weeks of age. They were anesthetized and inoculated intranasally with 30 \u03bcL of 103 TCID50 pdmH1N1 virus, 105 TCID50 H9N2/G1 virus, or PBS at day 0. Virus-infected or mock-treated mice were weighed daily. All animal care and experiments were conducted in accordance with the Committee on the Use of Live Animals in Teaching and Research guidelines of the University of Hong Kong.\nPreparation of Lung Homogenates\nVirus-infected or mock-treated mice were sacrificed at days 3, 7, and 14 after infection. The lungs were harvested and homogenized by a tissue homogenizer (Omni International). The homogenates were centrifuged at 2500 rpm for 10 minutes at 4\u00b0C. Supernatants were used for virus titer determination and cytokine detection.\nCytokine and Chemokine Detection\nExpression levels of interleukin (IL) 1\u03b1, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, tumor necrosis factor (TNF) \u03b1, interferon (IFN) \u03b3, macrophage inflammatory proteins (MIP)-1\u03b1, MIP-1\u03b2, monocyte chemotactic protein (MCP)-1, MCP-3, and Regulated upon Activation, Normal T-cell Expressed, and Secreted (RANTES) in the lung homogenates were quantitatively determined by flow cytometry\u2013based immunoassay (Mouse Th1/Th2 cytokine 10plex and Mouse Chemokines 6plex Flowcytomix Multiplex, Bender MedSystems) according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. Interleukin 1\u03b2 and keratinocyte chemoattractant (KC) simplex were purchased separately (Bender MedSystems). In brief, lung homogenates were prepared and processed accordingly. The samples were acquired on a BD LSRII (BD Bioscience), and the amount of cytokine (ng/mL) was calculated by FlowCytomix Pro 2.3 software (Bender MedSystems).\nPulmonary Histopathology\nVirus-infected or mock-treated mice were sacrificed at the indicated time point for histopathologic analysis. The lung tissues were fixed in 10% formalin and embedded in paraffin. Five-micrometer-thick, paraffin-embedded sections were cut and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) to analyze histological lesions. Histopathologic score of lung tissues was examined by a board-certified pathologist blinded to the exposure status. Lung inflammatory changes were graded using a semiquantitative scoring system based on the following parameters: peribronchiolar and bronchial infiltrates, bronchiolar and bronchial luminal exudates, perivascular infiltrates, parenchymal pneumonia, and edema, as previously described [28]. Each parameter was graded on a scale of 0\u20134 with 0 as absent, 1 as slight, 2 as mild, 3 as moderate, and 4 as severe. The total lung inflammation score was expressed as the sum of the scores for each parameter. The degree of cell infiltration was independently scored on an increasing scale of 0\u20133 with 0 as no cells, 1 as few cells, 2 as moderate influx of cells, and 3 as extensive influx of cells [29].\nStatistical Analysis\nData were expressed as mean (standard error of the mean). Unpaired Student t test in GraphPad Prism 5.0 software (GraphPad) was used for statistical analysis. A P value <.05 was considered significant.\nRESULTS\nrhMBL Binds Both pdmH1N1 and H9N2/GI Viruses\nA microtiter capture assay demonstrated that MBL could bind to pdmH1N1 and H9N2/G1 in vitro (Figure 1). The MBL-virus binding occurred in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 1A and 1D). Similarly, increased amount of virus could also result in increased binding by MBL (Figure 1B and 1E). MBL utilizes the CRD to recognize pathogens in a calcium-dependent manner [30]. Further addition of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) in the assay inhibited the binding of MBL to both strains of influenza virus (Figure 1C and 1F), suggesting that the binding occurred through the CRD of MBL.\nFigure 1.\nOpen in new tabDownload slide\nBinding of recombinant human mannose-binding lectin (rhMBL) to pdmH1N1 and H9N2/G1 influenza viruses. Binding of MBL to influenza viruses was determined by microtiter capture assay. Wells of plates were coated with influenza viruses, and MBL was incubated overnight in the virus-coated wells. A and D, MBL dose-dependent binding. Incubation with increasing amounts of MBL resulted in increasing levels of detected MBL bound to immobilized influenza virus. In contrast, MBL binding did not increase when the wells were coated with 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA). B and E, Virus dose-dependent binding. The amount of MBL binding was dependent on the amount of influenza virus used to coat the wells. C and F, Binding dependent on the absence of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA). MBL was incubated at 8 \u03bcg/mL in microtiter plates coated with 100 \u03bcg/mL 1% BSA, mannan, or influenza virus in the absence (control) or presence of EDTA for 2 h. Results are presented as mean \u00b1 standard error of the mean and are representative of 3 experiments. A450, absolute absorbance values measured at 450 nm; TCID50, median tissue culture infective dose.\nInfluenza Virus Infection Results in Greater Weight Loss in MBL WT Mice Than in MBL KO Mice\nWild-type and MBL KO mice, 6\u201310 weeks of age, were infected intranasally with 30 \u03bcL of 103 TCID50 pdmH1N1 virus or 105 TCID50 H9N2/G1 virus. The viral dosage chosen for the experiment was previously demonstrated to be sublethal (data not shown). Mice were inoculated with 30 \u03bcL of PBS as the mock treatment. No mice died throughout the 14-day experiment. The body weight of mice, which was a physiological value indicating infection progress and the health of the animals, was recorded daily. Mice receiving mock treatment did not lose body weight, demonstrating the absence of potential harmful effects due to anesthetics and intranasal inoculation (Figure 2A).\nFigure 2.\nOpen in new tabDownload slide\nWeight changes of mice after influenza virus infection. A, Mannose-binding lectin (MBL) wild-type (WT) C57B6/J and MBL knockout (KO) (n = 5 each) mice were inoculated with 25 \u03bcL phosphate-buffered saline as mock control. B, Mannose-binding lectin WT and MBL KO (n = 9 each) mice were inoculated intranasally with a median tissue culture infective dose (TCID50) of 103/30 \u03bcL of pdmH1N1 virus. C, Mannose-binding lectin WT (n = 10) and MBL KO mice (n = 9) were inoculated intranasally with TCID50 of 105/30 \u03bcL of H9N2/G1 virus. Results are presented as mean \u00b1 standard error of the mean of indicated number of mice per group. *P < .05, **P < .01, ***P < .001.\nBoth strains of influenza virus could successfully infect MBL WT and MBL KO mice as evidenced by the significant weight loss in these mice after virus infection. Compared to MBL KO mice, MBL WT mice had more weight loss upon virus infection. For pdmH1N1 virus infection, MBL WT mice showed a significantly greater body weight drop on days 3\u201312 compared with MBL KO mice (Figure 2B). The mean peak body weight loss observed in the MBL WT mice and MBL KO mice were \u201323.51% and \u201317.38%, respectively. For H9N2/G1 virus infection, MBL WT mice only showed a significantly greater weight loss on day 8 when compared with MBL KO mice (Figure 2C). Although similar mean peak weight loss was observed between the MBL WT mice and MBL KO mice after H9N2/G1 virus infection, MBL WT mice recovered more slowly than the KO mice. Collectively, these data suggested that the presence of MBL caused a more severe infection by the pdmH1N1 and H9N2/G1 viruses.\nLung Virus Titer in Infected Mice\nWild-type and MBL KO mice infected with pdmH1N1 or H9N2/G1 virus were sacrificed on days 3, 7, and 14 after infection. Virus titers in lung homogenates were determined by TCID50. As shown in Figure 3, these 2 strains of influenza virus were detectable in the lung homogenates collected from MBL WT and KO mice on day 3 and day 7, confirming viral lung infection. On day 14, titers for both strains of virus were undetectable, which was consistent with the regain of body weight by MBL WT and MBL KO mice and suggested recovery from the infection. For pdmH1N1 virus infection, there was no significant difference in the lung virus titer between MBL KO and MBL WT mice on days 3 and 7 after infection (Figure 3A). In contrast, significantly less virus titer was detected in MBL KO mice on day 7 but not on day 3 after H9N2/G1 virus infection compared to that in MBL WT mice (Figure 3B).\nFigure 3.\nOpen in new tabDownload slide\nViral titers in lung tissues from infected mannose-binding lectin (MBL) wild-type (WT) and MBL knockout (KO) mice. Whole lungs were harvested (5 mice per group) for virus titration. A, PdmH1N1 viral titers were determined on indicated times after infection, and no significant difference was found between MBL WT and MBL KO mice. B, H9N2/G1 viral titers were determined on indicated times after infection. Results are presented as mean \u00b1 standard error of the mean of 5 mice per group. *P < .05. TCID50, median tissue culture infective dose.\nMBL Upregulates the Inflammatory Response to Influenza Virus Infection\nTo further investigate whether MBL would modify the inflammatory response upon pdmH1N1 and H9N2/G1 virus infection, a panel of 14 proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines were examined in the lung homogenates collected from the infected MBL WT and MBL KO mice. The simultaneous profiling of the cytokines and chemokines was examined by using bead-based suspension array, which could allow the sensitive and specific detection of these proteins in the available amount of lung homogenates.\nAs shown in Figures 4 and 5, upon pdmH1N1 and H9N2/G1 virus infection, inflammatory response assayed by cytokines and chemokines production was triggered in both MBL WT and MBL KO mice. Except for IL-2, of which the level remained constantly low during the course of experiment, the kinetics of individual proteins were similar in that they were readily detectable on day 3, reached the highest level on day 7, and declined on day 14. Strikingly, MBL KO mice had reduced inflammatory responses during infection. Among the 14 cytokines examined, the majority of them showed significantly lower amounts in MBL KO mice lung homogenates than in MBL WT mice, including IL-1\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, IL-10, TNF-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b3 (Figures 4A and 5A), KC, MIP-1\u03b1, MIP-1\u03b2, MCP-1, MCP-3 and RANTES (Figures 4B and 5B). These results suggested that MBL upregulates the inflammatory response to influenza virus infection, resulting in elevated production of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines in the MBL WT mice as compared with the MBL KO mice.\nFigure 4.\nOpen in new tabDownload slide\nProduction of the proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines in the lung homogenates from pdmH1N1 virus infected mannose-binding lectin (MBL) wild-type (WT) and MBL knockout (KO) mice.

On day 14, significantly higher amount of macrophage inflammatory proteins (MIP)-1\u03b1 and Regulated upon Activation, Normal T-cell Expressed, and Secreted (RANTES) were found in infected MBL WT mice than in MBL KO mice. The concentrations of cytokines shown are mean \u00b1 standard error of the mean of 5 mice per group and 2 mice per mock treatment group. *P < .05, **P < .01.\nFigure 5.\nOpen in new tabDownload slide\nProduction of the proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines in the lung homogenates from H9N2/G1 virus\u2013infected mannose-binding lectin (MBL) wild-type (WT) and MBL knockout (KO) mice.

On day 7, significantly higher amounts of IL-1\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, IL-4, IL-10, tumor necrosis factor (TNF) \u03b1, and interferon (IFN) \u03b3 were found in infected MBL WT mice than in MBL KO mice.

On day 7, significantly higher amounts of keratinocyte chemoattractant (KC), macrophage inflammatory proteins (MIP)-1\u03b1, MIP-1\u03b2, monocyte chemotactic protein (MCP)-1, and MCP-3 were found in infected MBL WT mice than in MBL KO mice. On day 14, significantly higher amounts of MIP-1\u03b2, MCP-1, and Regulated upon Activation, Normal T-cell Expressed, and Secreted (RANTES) were found in infected MBL WT mice than in MBL KO mice.

In the histological sections of MBL WT mice, more severe lung inflammation and more cell infiltration were observed when compared to that of MBL KO mice on day 7 (Figure 6). Consistent with our cytokine and chemokine data, the pulmonary histological analysis suggested that the MBL WT mice had a more severe inflammatory response upon pdmH1N1 and H9N2/G1 virus infection.\nFigure 6.\nOpen in new tabDownload slide\nHistological analysis of pulmonary tissues from infected and mock-treated mannose-binding lectin (MBL) wild-type (WT) and MBL knockout (KO) mice.

Scale bar: 100 \u03bcm.\nDISCUSSION\nMannose-binding lectin is a pattern-recognition molecule, which provides first line of host defense. Accumulating evidence has suggested that MBL exhibits in vitro anti-influenza virus properties by direct neutralization, inhibiting influenza virus hemagglutination, binding to the influenza virus as an opsonin, and activating the complement system through the lectin pathway [14, 16, 23]. However, these properties vary among different virus strains and subtypes [17, 18]. In this study, we focused on the pandemic influenza A H1N1 virus and avian influenza A H9N2/G1 virus, which are of potential threat to the global community.\nWe demonstrated that despite these 2 strains of viruses being bound by rhMBL via the CRD of MBL at the physiological level, they infected both MBL WT and MBL KO mice effectively. Our results are consistent with a recent in vitro study by Job et al [18], in which MBL was found to bind to pdmH1N1 fairly in vitro but the virus was resistant to the antiviral activity of MBL. The number and position of potential glycosylation sites on the viral HA globular domain determine the binding affinity between MBL and the virus. Even though MBL can physically bind to the virus, the binding may be insufficient for executing any antiviral function. Arguably, Chang et al [23] recently reported that MBL deficiency increases susceptibility to infection with influenza A virus Philippine 82 H3N2 (Phil82), which is a human strain. We reconcile with the suggestion that MBL effects would differ depending on strains of influenza A virus and thus MBL causes variable antiviral activities and host responses. The degree of glycosylation on the globular head of the HA molecule is believed to be essential for MBL to exhibit its antiviral properties. For Phil82 virus, the high-mannose oligosaccharide at residue 165 of the HA molecule has already been shown to be crucial for the neutralization by MBL [31]. Although pdmH1N1 virus contains a single potential glycosylation site at the base of the HA globular head (Asn104), it lacks potential glycosylation sites on the globular head region of HA (Asn142, Asn144, Asn172, Asn177, and Asn179) [18]. To our knowledge, binding of MBL on H9N2/G1 virus is not well documented in the literature. Therefore, we analyzed the potential glycosylation sites on HA of H9N2/G1 virus based on an in silico approach as suggested by Job et al [18]. The HA sequence data was retrieved from GenBank (AAF00706.1) and we used NetNGlyc 1.0 server to predict the number of potential glycosylation sites. We found that there was no potential glycosylation sites near residue 165 of the HA molecule of H9N2/G1 virus. We speculate that as a result of the absence of potential glycosylation sites near the receptor-binding domain of the HA globular head of both pdmH1N1 virus and H9N2/G1 virus, MBL fails to interfere with the viral binding to target cells despite its ability to bind the virus. This can adequately explain the discrepancy between the present in vivo data and Chang\u2019s study [23].\nIn this study, MBL WT mice were found to have a more severe disease in terms of greater weight loss and worse lung pathology than MBL KO mice during either pdmH1N1 or H9N2/G1 virus infection. This suggests that MBL may contribute to the disease severity seen in the MBL WT mice. To elucidate the mechanisms, we investigated the immune response, such as production of cytokines and chemokines at various time points during the infection. Most cytokines and chemokines were detected with similar kinetics, with the peak on day 7 following influenza virus infection in both MBL WT and MBL KO mice. These data suggest that the most critical phase of influenza infection occurs around day 7 after infection, and this is consistent with the result showing the peak of body weight loss around day 7.\nInterestingly, we found that MBL contributed to a more severe proinflammatory response by increasing the production of several proinflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, TNF-\u03b1, and IFN-\u03b3. Interleukin 1\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 are multifunctional proinflammatory cytokines produced readily by influenza-infected leukocytes. They are capable of inducing fever, anorexia, and weight loss [32]. Enhanced production of these cytokines can contribute to the acute lung immunopathology after influenza virus infection in mice [33] and induce gene expression of other cytokines like IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1 [34, 35]. Despite the abundance of IL-6 following the influenza virus infection, in vivo studies showed that it does not contribute significantly to the pathogenesis of influenza virus infection because the mortality and morbidity observed in mice infected with H5N1 are comparable in both MBL WT and IL-6 deficient mice [36, 37]. Tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 is readily produced by influenza virus\u2013infected leukocytes and can activate macrophages, stimulate dendritic cell maturation and neutrophils, further enhance the inflammatory response, and activate efficient antigen presentation system in the infected site [20, 38]. Excessive production of TNF-\u03b1 causes tissue injury, hemorrhagic shock, and death in mice [39, 40]. Interferon \u03b3 is also an important proinflammatory cytokine that has different functions, including the activation of macrophages, differentiation of Th1 from T cells, enhancement of antigen presentation, and expression of the chemokine gene [41, 42]. These proinflammatory cytokines are commonly found in the acute-phase response to influenza virus infection and may induce immunity but also cause damage to the host tissue [43]. These cytokines were also increased in our infected murine lung, with significantly higher levels in MBL WT mice than in MBL KO mice on day 7, coinciding with body weight loss and lung histological findings. Interleukin 10, an anti-inflammatory cytokine, was also significantly higher in MBL WT mice than in MBL KO mice on day 7. Interleukin 10 deficiency was reportedly protective in high-dose influenza virus infection [44], implying that increased IL-10 may be deleterious to the host. As a consequence of such an overwhelming \u201ccytokine storm\u201d [45, 46], the MBL WT mice were found to have a worse disease course than in the MBL KO mice, including greater body weight loss and more severe lung inflammation.\nIn addition, we also found that most chemokines, including KC, MIP-1\u03b1, MIP-1\u03b2, MCP-1, and MCP-3, were elevated in MBL WT mice compared with the MBL KO mice in both pdmH1N1 and G1/97 virus infection. Influenza virus\u2013infected macrophages produced large amounts of these chemokines in vitro [25, 47, 48]. Functionally, these chemokines are important mediators for immune cell activation and chemotactic factors, which recruit leukocytes to the infected sites [49]. This may help account for our histological observation that more inflammatory cell infiltration was observed in MBL WT mice than in MBL KO mice.\nThe role of MBL in modulating immune responses has also been observed in Staphylococcus aureus infection. It was shown that MBL amplifies the host immune response during S. aureus infection by cooperating with Toll-like receptors 2 and 6 and augments the production of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines [50]. The observation from our present study prompted us to further investigate whether MBL may also cooperate with other pattern-recognition receptors and thus further amplify the host response during influenza virus infection.\nIn conclusion, we have shown for the first time that MBL is a risk factor leading to a more severe pdmH1N1 and H9N2/G1 virus infection by upregulating proinflammatory responses.\nNotes\nFinancial support.\nThis work was supported in part by the National Institutes of Health (U01AI074503); the Area of Excellence program on influenza supported by the University Grants Committee of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, China (AoE/M-12/06); the Research Fund for the Control of Infectious Diseases, Hong Kong SAR government (Lab-11); and the Chung Ko Lee and Cheung Yuen Kan Education and Research Fund in Paediatric Immunology.\nPotential conflicts of interest.\nAll authors: No reported conflicts.\nAll authors have submitted the ICMJE Form for Disclosure of Potential Conflicts of Interest.

The top 3 SNPs on the basis of statistical significance were also in genes of biological plausibility: rs2066786 in RFC1 (replication factor C1) (P = 1.88 \u00d7 10\u22125; odds ratio [OR], 0.68 [95% confidence interval {CI}, .56\u2013.81]); rs2298771 in SCN1A (sodium channel, neuronal type I \u03b1 subunit) (P = 5.87 \u00d7 10\u22125; OR, 1.47 [95% CI, 1.21\u20131.77]); and rs25651 in ANPEP (ananyl aminopeptidase) (P = 1.44 \u00d7 10\u22124; OR, 0.69 [95% CI, .56\u2013.83]). Additional genotyping of these SNPs in a separate sample of 264 case patients and 296 control patients resulted in a lack of significance in the replication cohort; joint significance was as follows: rs2066786, P = .0022; rs2298771, P = .005; rs25651, P = .042. Using mostly nonsynonymous variants, we therefore did not identify genetic variants associated with neuroinvasive disease.\nTopic: aminopeptidase genes single nucleotide polymorphism sodium channel genetics genetic aspects west nile viral infections genotype determination neurologic complications\nIssue Section: Viruses\nOver the past decade, West Nile virus (WNV) has emerged as an important human pathogen in North America, where it has been reported in a majority of states and provinces in the United States and Canada [1\u20133]. Of those infected, approximately 20% develop mild symptoms (\u201cWest Nile fever,\u201d eg, fever, malaise, headache, myalgia, rash) [4] and about 1 in 150 develop meningitis or encephalitis [4, 5]. The incidence of severe neurological syndromes increases with age and includes encephalitis, meningitis, acute flaccid paralysis, peripheral neuropathy, polyradiculopathy, optic neuritis, and acute demyelinating encephalitis [5\u20139]. Pathological changes within the central nervous system appear to be due to several factors, including the direct result of viral proliferation within neuronal and glial cells, cytotoxic immune response to infected cells, diffuse perivascular inflammation, and microglial nodule formation [10\u201312].\nGiven the fact that only a small minority of those infected develop severe disease and the fact that risk factors, apart from older age and immunosuppression [1, 13\u201315], are not well defined, there is a strong rationale to suspect a genetic predisposition to WNV neurological complications. Several putative susceptibility genes have been reported in single candidate gene studies. An association between symptomatic WNV disease and homozygosity for the CCR5\u039432 mutation in the chemokine receptor gene CCR5 was initially reported [16, 17]. More recently, this association was not replicated, but a study suggestive of a link to clinical manifestations of infection with CCR5\u039432 mutation was reported [18]. The plausibility of a susceptibility locus in the oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS) gene cluster was reported [19, 20]. More recently, a candidate gene study examining the OAS gene cluster alone suggested a predisposition to WNV infection [21].\nBecause exposure to WNV is difficult to control for, we sought to examine genetic susceptibility to complications given documented WNV infection. We hypothesized that the use of coding nonsynonymous markers would result in the discovery of \u22651 genetic variants associated with severe WNV disease that may be directly likely to lead to a causal mechanism. We report an association between the replication factor C1 gene, RFC1, and severe WNV disease in the first phase of association testing. We found no association between CCR5\u039432 mutation and a susceptibility to severe complications to WNV infection. Similarly, we found no association between the OAS gene cluster and severe WNV disease. Our results indicate that RFC1 may potentially play a role in the etiology of severe WNV illness.\nPARTICIPANTS AND METHODS\nStudy Participants\nDuring the period September 2004 through December 2009, we enrolled participants from states and provinces in the United States (Nebraska, Pennsylvania, Texas, and Colorado) and Canada (Alberta and Saskatchewan) that were among those with the highest number of individuals with severe WNV disease. Individuals were eligible if they were aged \u226518 years and had evidence of WNV infection on the basis of Centers for Disease Control and Prevention diagnostic laboratory criteria [22]. Case patients were defined as patients who met criteria for WNV infection along with modified case definitions for meningitis, encephalitis, or acute flaccid paralysis [9]. Control participants were individuals who met criteria for infection but who did not meet clinical case definitions for meningitis or encephalitis. Because the majority of testing for WNV is performed centrally by state or provincial laboratories, the state or provincial health departments contacted persons with laboratory-confirmed WNV infection by letter and by telephone to see if they were willing to be approached about the study. Clinical information about WNV infection was obtained by contacting patients\u2019 physicians and through review of medical records. The study received institutional review board approval from McMaster University, McGill University, Nebraska Medical Center, University of Pennsylvania, and University of Texas at San Antonio.\nGenotyping\nBlood samples were collected at the time of enrollment and genomic DNA obtained with the use of a DNA isolation kit (Qiagen). For the first stage of the study, genotyping was conducted using the Illumina HumanNS-12 BeadChip, based largely on single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) selected by the Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium that included all known nsSNPs with >1% minor allele frequency in European populations at the time of study design [23]. The Illumina HumanNS-12 chip included 13\u200a371 SNPs, of which the majority were nonsynonymous variants but also included synonymous, untranslated, and tagSNPs. For the validation and replication stage, 2 panels of 34 SNPs each were designed using Sequenom MassARRAY IPLEX Gold; these included 47 SNPs with the highest association in the derivation cohort at 1 of 2 time points; 15 tagSNPs to fine map the gene that showed the highest association in the derivation cohort; 5 coding nonsynonymous SNPs uncovered in genes that were sequenced; and CCR5\u039432 (rs333), a 32\u2013base pair (bp) deletion in CCR5 that was shown to be associated with clinical symptoms of WNV infection [18]. Duplicate samples were included, and laboratory technicians were blind to the case status of samples.\nSample Quality Control\nIllumina HumanNS-12 Array.\nThere were 1677 unique samples that were genotyped. Twenty samples were present in duplicate, and 1 was in triplicate. Four Centre d'Etude du Polymorphisme Humain controls were genotyped multiple times. Three duplicate samples that did not correspond to the same DNA were removed from further analysis. From the remaining samples, we calculated a pairwise reproducibility rate of 99.9926% before applying any filters on the markers. We computed the mean number of alleles shared identical by state in all possible pairs of individuals to detect population structure and cryptic relatedness in the sample. The set of SNPs used to compute this distribution was restricted to the autosomes and was selected in such a way that no 2 SNPs were allowed to be in linkage disequilibrium with each at r2 > 0.2, in any window of 50 consecutive SNPs. To minimize admixture and other population effects, we restricted the genetic studies to samples of Caucasian origin. We excluded samples obtained from individuals who were not of self-declared non-Hispanic white ancestry, and we conducted a multidimentional scaling analysis comparing samples from the present study to HapMap samples derived from 3 populations [24] in order to identify samples from individuals whose ancestry was likely of non-Caucasian origin. Pairs of individuals who were identified as being likely related were broken up: we kept the case patient if both members of the pair were phenotypically discordant; otherwise, we kept the first participant enrolled. Seemingly related pairs involving 2 participants from distinct collection centers were discarded, on the basis that this was caused by either a sample switch or a contamination. Using this strategy, 29 individuals (17 control patients, 3 case-control pairs due to switches, and 3 case-control pairs with shared DNA) were excluded. Using all the SNPs on the X chromosome, we found inconsistencies regarding the sex of 6 individuals, who were excluded from the analysis. Samples that did not achieve a 90% call rate were excluded from the analysis.\nSequenom Assays.\nIn a second stage, 2 panels of 34 SNPs were each genotyped in a total of 2350 unique DNA samples, a number that includes the 1677 samples genotyped on the Illumina HumanNS-12 array for the primary analysis. The samples that were removed in the primary analysis (except those that were removed for reason of low call rate) were also removed in the second stage. Samples that were not obtained from participants of self-declared non-Hispanic white ancestry were excluded. Samples that did not reach an 85% call rate in 1 panel were excluded from the analysis of that panel.\nSNP Quality Control\nTo be included in the analysis, an SNP had to have a call rate \u226595%. Genotypic frequencies had to be consistent with the rules of Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium among control patients, at a significance level above a threshold that was chosen so that the distribution of Hardy-Weinberg significance levels among the remaining SNPs did not deviate from what was expected by chance alone (P > .0005 for the Illumina HumanNS-12 assays; P > .001 for the Sequenom assays).\nAssociation Analysis\nWe used logistic regression to test for association between single SNPs and case-control status, assuming a log-additive effect of the alleles on the risk. For SNPs on the X chromosome, males were treated as homozygous females [25]. We adjusted for the collection center (ie, used as covariate) to account for possible local variations in allele frequencies or local selection. SNPs were deemed to be significant if their P values were below the 5% level, subject to a Bonferroni correction for the number of SNPs tested (P < 4.7 \u00d7 10\u22126, accounting for 10\u200a625 tests). Power to detect an association at this significance level was calculated using CaTS [26].\nForty-eight samples were randomly selected among the cases for resequencing with a view to fine-mapping the RFC1, SCN1A, and ANPEP exons and promoter regions. Primers were designed for amplification of the coding regions, as well as 1kb regions upstream and downstream of the genes.\nRESULTS\nNonsynonymous SNP Testing of WNV Severe Disease\nWe initially genotyped the Illumina HumanNS-12 array in 1677 participants: 608 case patients with neuroinvasive disease (112 meningitis, 72 encephalitis, 195 meningo-encephalitis, and 229 acute flaccid paralysis), 994 control patients, and 75 of equivocal or unknown status. There were 63 samples excluded (44 case patients, 16 control patients, and 3 of equivocal or unknown status) because of non-European ancestry (Supplementary figure 1), 26 samples excluded (2 case patients, 21 control patients, and 1 of unknown status) because of cryptic relatedness, 2 samples (1 case patient and 1 of unknown status) removed because of low call rates (<95%), 6 samples (1 case patient and 5 control patients) removed for inconsistent sex information, and 3 samples genotyped in duplicate (3 control patients) but that corresponded to different DNAs. There were 307 SNPs excluded from analysis for not reaching a sufficient call rate; 52 SNPs failed Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium at a level P < .0005; and 2387 SNPs with minor allele frequency less than 1% (including 1246 monomorphic SNPs) were excluded. The first-stage analysis was performed on 10\u200a625 SNPs in 560 case patients and 950 control patients. A summary of their characteristics is shown in Table 1.\nTable 1.\nCharacteristics of Study Participants\nCharacteristic  Study Center\n  Alberta  Colorado  Manitoba  Nebraska  Ohio  Ontario  Pennsylvania  Saskatchewan  Texas  Total \nPrimary samples                     \nControl patients  75  73  0  357  0  36  41  340  28  950 \nFemale sex, %  53.3  67.1  \u2026  51  \u2026  58.3  61  63.2  57.1  57.7 \nMean age, years (SD)  49.6 (12.5)  50.8 (11)  \u2026  54.6 (13.3)  \u2026  52.7 (11.2)  54.7 (13.3)  52.5 (13.6)  52.5 (14.1)  53 (13.2) \nCase patients  17  38  5  199  0  25  81  31  164  560 \nAcute flaccid paralysis  3  4  1  48  \u2026  3  32  2  116  209 \nEncephalitis  6  8  0  33  \u2026  7  3  0  11  68 \nMeningitis  3  5  0  41  \u2026  3  28  15  7  102 \nMeningo-Encephalitis  5  21  4  77  \u2026  12  18  14  30  181 \nFemale sex, %  23.5  42.1  40.0  52.3  \u2026  52.0  51.9  64.0  42.0  48.2 \nMean age, years (SD)  56.8 (13.8)  56.6 (13)  60.2 (12.9)  55.6 (15.2)  \u2026  54.7 (14.7)  62.9 (15.1)  59.4 (14.5)  61.3 (14.8)  58.7(15) \nReplication samples                     \nControl patients  3  24  0  182  6  0  21  0  60  296 \nFemale sex, %  66.7  66.7  \u2026  57.7  66.7  \u2026  47.6  \u2026  66.7  59.8 \nMean age, years (SD)  54.7 (1.53)  54.3 (11.6)  \u2026  54.8 (13.8)  58.3 (11.3)  \u2026  55.2 (13.9)  \u2026  56.6 (12.2)  55.2 (13.1) \nCase patients  0  20  0  36  17  0  101  0  90  264 \nAcute flaccid paralysis  \u2026  13  \u2026  11  3  \u2026  41  \u2026  52  120 \nEncephalitis  \u2026  0  \u2026  7  0  \u2026  5  \u2026  2  14 \nMeningitis  \u2026  3  \u2026  12  5  \u2026  25  \u2026  13  58 \nMeningo-Encephalitis  \u2026  4  \u2026  6  9  \u2026  30  \u2026  23  72 \nFemale sex, %  \u2026  45  \u2026  52.8  64.7  \u2026  49.5  \u2026  45.6  49.2 \nMean age, years (SD)  \u2026  59.2 (14.3)  \u2026  56.9 (17.1)  70 (15.7)  \u2026  64.6 (15.0)  \u2026  61.5 (13.8)  62.4 (15.1) \nAbbreviation:\u2002SD, standard deviation.\nOpen in new tab\nThe results from this analysis are summarized in Table 2 for all SNPs selected to undergo replication (see below). The 3 results with the highest levels of significance were from genes potentially biologically relevant: rs2066786 (P = 1.88 \u00d7 10\u22125; odds ratio [OR], 0.68 for the major allele [95% confidence interval {CI}, .57\u2013.81]), an exonic synonomous SNP (Pro847Pro) found in the replication factor C1 gene (RFC1 [MIM 102579]); rs2298771 (P = 5.87 \u00d7 10\u22125; OR, 1.47 [95% CI, 1.22\u20131.77]), a missense SNP (Ala1056Thr) in the sodium channel, voltage-gated, type I, \u03b1 subunit gene (SCN1A [MIM 182389]); and rs25651 (P = 1.44 \u00d7 10\u22124; OR, 0.69 [95% CI, .56\u2013.83]), a missense SNP (Ser752Asn) found in the alanyl (membrane) aminopeptidase gene (ANPEP [MIM 151530]). As described in detail below, each of these genes has biological plausibility, with RFC1 potentially having a role in viral replication [27], SCN1A having a role in seizure disorders [28], and ANPEP a receptor for human coronavirus [29].\nTable 2.\nResults From the Primary Association Analyses Between Single-Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) and Risk of Neuroinvasive Disease in Patients Infected With

A total of 5 coding nonsynonymous variants not already genotyped were uncovered in the 3 genes (1 in RFC1, 2 in SCN1A, and 2 in ANPEP). All these novel variants showed at most 2 instances of the nonreference allele out of the 96 chromosomes, making them rare variants, each with estimated frequency <2% in the case patients. In addition, we confirmed a number of known and rare coding nonsynonymous SNPs that were already indexed in the dbSNP database at the time of the sequencing experiment.\nValidation of Significant Markers\nTo validate findings from the first stage of the analysis, we genotyped 68 SNPs, including 47 SNPs taken on the basis of the results of the analysis of the Illumina HumanNS-12 array, at 2 different time points during the course of the project (the top 15 SNPs on the basis of a preliminary analysis of the first 445 case patients and 813 control patients collected, and the top 32 SNPs not already selected on the basis of the analysis of the complete sample, after pruning SNPs found to be in high linkage disequilibrium [r2 > 0.8] with better ranked SNPs); 15 tagSNPs to try to refine the association seen in RFC1 with rs2066786, a variant that does not change the amino acid in the amino acid sequence of the gene; and the 5 coding nonsynonymous SNPs uncovered after sequencing the RFC1, SCN1A, and ANPEP genes. In addition, we included in a panel rs333, a 32-bp deletion in CCR5 shown to be associated with increased risk of WNV infection, for which a design on the Illumina HumanNS-12 array was not available. Two control patients had insufficient call rates on both Sequenom panels and were excluded from the analysis; an additional 25 samples (6 case patients, 16 control patients, and 1 equivocal) failed only 1 Sequenom panel and were excluded only for SNPs on that panel. After excluding samples with low call rates, the SNPs were tested in the original set of (up to, depending on panel failure) 560 case patients and 950 control patients, in an additional set of 560 samples (264 case patients and 296 control patients), and in all samples jointly considered. The results are summarized in Supplementary table 1. For rs2066786 in RFC1,P = .58 in the replication set and a joint P = .0022. For rs2298771 in SCN1A,P = .58 in the replication cohort, with joint P = .0050. For rs25651 in ANPEP, the replication P value is .037, but the risk allele (the one that is more frequent among the case patients) is different from the risk allele in the original sample set, and as a result the joint P value increases to .042. None of the following 44 ranked SNPs replicated in the additional samples genotyped.\nFine mapping of RFC1 did not provide additional insights: significance levels are comparable to the original significance observed for rs2066786 and can be explained by the linkage disequilibrium structure in the region (Supplementary figure 2).\nEffect of Rare Coding Nonsynonymous Variants\nThe rare coding nonsynonymous variants uncovered by sequencing RFC1, SCN1A, and ANPEP were genotyped. No significant associations (Fisher exact test) were found between these rare mutations and the case/control status (data not shown). Collapsing the counts of carriers of rare variants across SNPs within genes did not provide additional insights.\nLack of Replication of Associations Reported in the Literature\nAn association between symptomatic WNV disease and homozygosity for the CCR5\u039432 mutation in the chemokine receptor gene CCR5 was initially reported [16, 17]. More recently, this association was not replicated, but results suggestive of a link to clinical manifestations of infection with CCR5\u039432 mutation were reported [18]. The plausibility of a susceptibility locus in the OAS gene cluster was reported [19, 20]. More recently, a candidate gene study examining the OAS gene cluster alone suggested a predisposition to WNV infection [21]. There were 13 (1.58%) of 821 case patients who were homozygous for the CCR5\u039432 deletion, compared with 13 (1.05%) of 1233 control patients (OR, 1.51 [95% CI, .70\u20133.27]; P = .30). For genes in the OAS cluster, ORs ranged from 1.1 to 1.13 for 4 OAS variants with all P values >.05 (Supplementary table 2).\nPower to Detect an Association\nWe calculated the power that a sample consisting of 824 case patients and 1246 control patients (the sample used in the joint analysis) has to detect an association with a polymorphism whose risk is assumed to act additively with the number of risk alleles an individual possesses assuming homogeneity across collection centers. Supplementary figure 3 shows that the sample has 80% power to detect an association at P < 4.7 \u00d7 10\u22126 (a level deemed to be significant even after a Bonferroni correction for all SNPs tested) for relative risks as low as 1.5 (depending on the risk allele frequency).\nDISCUSSION\nWe sought to test for common genetic polymorphisms associated with severe WNV complications in a North American population using mainly nonsynonomous SNPs. We identified a variant in each of 3 genes (RFC1, SCN1A, ANPEP) potentially implicated in susceptibility to such neurological complications. Joint analysis showed for RFC1-rs2066786, P = .0022 SCN1A-rs2298771, P = .005 and ANPEP-rs25651, P= .042. SNPs in other candidate genes (OAS, TLR3 [Toll-like receptor 3 gene]) were not significant. Our findings reveal preliminary information that genetic variants may play a role in susceptibility to severe WNV disease.\nHuman replication factor C (RFC), also called activator-1, is a multimeric primer-recognition protein consisting of 5 distinct subunits [27]. Human RFC was purified from extracts of HeLa cells as a host factor essential for the in vitro replication of simian virus 40 DNA. RFC allows for efficient elongation of DNA in the presence of human single-stranded DNA binding protein. Using interaction cloning, Uchiumi et al found that the large subunit of RFC interacts with the DNA sequence repeats of telomeres [30]. They found that RFC recognizes the 5\u2032-phosphate termini of double-stranded telomeric repeats. The authors suggested that RFC may be involved in telomere stability or turnover. Presumably, if RFC1 plays a pathogenic role in WNV, it could be with respect to facilitating viral replication.\nTo explain the lack of replication of rs2066786, we assessed the effect of this variant on the 3 subcategories of neuroinvasive disease (meningitis, encephalitis, or acute flaccid paralysis). As shown in Table 2, there was no difference in effects. Population structure in the replication cohort is another possible explanation for lack of replication. Indeed, continental differences in European ancestry have been described [31]. However, we did not identify any differences even adjusting for ancestry informative markers. We reviewed phenotype data and could not identify any systematic differences in phenotyping.\nAn association between the 32-bp deletion in CCR5 and West Nile clinical symptoms has been reported [18]. We found no evidence of any effect. One possible reason for the discrepancy is that we compared case patients with control patients, all of whom were symptomatic when infected with WNV. In contrast, the published reports compared case patients with control patients with no symptoms. Notably, we found no association between any of the OAS polymorphisms and WNV. We believe that this highlights the importance of conducting human population-based studies. Although TLR was also reported to be a mechanism in a murine model, we saw no significant effect in this population-based study [32].\nStrengths of this study include the rigorous definitions and procedures used to confirm case and control status. All clinical and laboratory data had to have supportive documentation, including laboratory records and clinical information. Selection of case patients and control patients was as unbiased as could be achieved. In the states and provinces that we selected, all of those who were infected were invited to participate through notification from public health laboratories where the great majority of testing occurred. We acknowledge that sample size for such an association study was limited, but this is a function of the number of WNV neuroinvasive cases seen in North America.\nFunding\nThis work was supported by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health (contract HHSN266200400066C).\nReferences\n1.

At present, imaging of diseases, such as swine-origin H1N1 influenza, is largely restricted to chest radiograph and computed tomography (CT), which can detect pulmonary structural changes in severely ill patients but are more limited in characterizing the early stages of illness, differentiating inflammation from infection or tracking immune responses. In contrast, imaging modalities, such as positron emission tomography, single photon emission CT, magnetic resonance imaging, and bioluminescence imaging, which have become useful tools for investigating the pathogenesis of a range of disease processes, could be used to advance in vivo studies of respiratory viral infections in patients and animals. Molecular techniques might also be used to identify novel biomarkers of disease progression and to evaluate new therapies.\nTopic: positron-emission tomography magnetic resonance imaging influenza computed tomography inflammation lung single photon emission computed tomography immune response animals, laboratory biological markers disease progression chest x-ray suidae virus diseases infections diagnostic imaging swine influenza molecular imaging bioluminescence\nIssue Section: Perspective\nThe public health importance of novel respiratory viral infections has been underlined during the past decade by the emergence of H5N1 avian influenza in Southeast Asia, the epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), and the pandemic of swine-origin H1N1 influenza that began in early 2009. As each new disease has been identified, physicians have made use of chest radiography and computed tomography (CT) to characterize pulmonary morphologic changes in patients at the time of presentation and in cases of severe illness and to identify prognostic markers of disease progression [1\u20135]. However, although these radiographic methods are useful for clinical management, their ability to elucidate underlying pathologic mechanisms is much more limited. Research would, therefore, benefit from techniques that could image physiologic processes in patients or in laboratory animals over the course of illness. In this regard, the use of molecular imaging methods could markedly enhance the ability to study the pathophysiology of influenza and other emerging respiratory viral infections.\nMolecular imaging has been defined by the Society of Nuclear Medicine as \u201cthe visualization, characterization, and measurement of biological processes at the molecular and cellular levels in humans and other living systems\u201d [6]. It may use multiple imaging modalities, with either 2-dimensional or 3-dimensional images, and can involve quantification of data over time. The key factor is that data are obtained through the interaction of the imaging mechanism with cellular or subcellular processes, such as enzymatic modification or receptor binding. [7, 8]. Single-photon emission CT (SPECT) and positron emission tomography (PET) can be used for molecular imaging by using radiolabeled probes to detect the presence of specific target molecules or biochemical reactions in sites of interest. In addition, some applications of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) use differences in susceptibilities to magnetic fields to label cells and differentiate surrounding tissues. Bioluminescence imaging (BLI) can also elucidate pathophysiologic processes in murine models of human illness, using visible light produced by luciferase or other recombinant reporter molecules.\nIn this article, we describe how molecular imaging methods could be used to study respiratory viral infections in patients and laboratory animals. The first section assesses the capabilities and limitations of current radiographic methods, by reviewing typical chest radiograph and CT findings in swine-origin H1N1 influenza, H5N1 avian influenza, and SARS. We then describe how SPECT, PET, MRI, and BLI could be used to enhance our understanding of the underlying mechanisms of these disease processes.\nCHEST RADIOGRAPH AND CT IMAGING OF RESPIRATORY VIRAL INFECTIONS\nClinical radiography assesses the physical characteristics of body tissues based on the attenuation of high-energy photons (X-rays) as they pass through regions of differing density. Soon after X-rays were discovered in 1895, the human thorax was found to be an excellent substrate for imaging, because the air-filled lungs provided a low-density background against which areas of consolidation and other structural changes could be visualized. The value of chest radiography for assessing the severity of respiratory tract infections was firmly established during the 1918 influenza pandemic, in which the new radiologic capabilities were widely implemented to study patients and to correlate imaging with pathologic and clinical findings [9]. At the same time, it was recognized that the radiographic changes typical of severe influenza were also observed in other conditions, both infectious and noninfectious. The ability of chest radiographs to detect and discriminate disease processes was also restricted by overlapping projections of soft tissues. Although this problem was partly mitigated by the development of CT, which enabled major advances in image resolution, the sensitivity and specificity of radiographic imaging remain limited by the absence of unique features to distinguish infection from inflammation and by the lack of standardized scoring systems for disease severity [9, 10]. The value of chest radiographs and CT for research is also restricted by the difficulty of obtaining direct radiologic-pathologic correlation, because lung tissue samples from patients with influenza are only examined when a case ends in death, followed by autopsy.\nThe capabilities and limitations of radiography for the study of respiratory viral infections are illustrated by reports from past disease outbreaks and the swine-origin H1N1 influenza pandemic [10\u201314]. In cases of mild, self-limited illness, in which lesions apparently remain localized to the upper respiratory tract (Figure 1D), the chest radiograph is either normal or displays only minor changes. The development of more severe disease is typically marked by the appearance of multiple patchy densities in one or both lungs, in a multilobar peripheral distribution (Figure 1A). By CT, these areas are termed ground-glass opacities (GGO) because of the hazy density of the lesions, in which the margins of bronchi and blood vessels are partially visible (Figure 1B). Autopsy findings suggest that GGO correspond to foci of viral pneumonitis and/or diffuse alveolar damage (Figure 1E). However, GGO are also seen in a variety of other pulmonary diseases, both infectious and noninfectious, in which they may reflect partial airspace filling, interstitial cellular infiltration or edema, capillary congestion, or a combination of these factors [10, 12, 14]. CT imaging of some patients with swine-origin H1N1 influenza has also shown consolidative patterns, in which the increased lesion density obscures all parenchymal structures except for some traversing open airways (air bronchograms), consistent with either severe viral injury or bacterial pneumonia (Figure 1C, 1E) [12, 15].\nFigure 1.\nOpen in new tabDownload slide\nRadiographs and histopathologic examination of lung tissues at autopsy of patients fatally infected with pandemic swine-origin H1N1 influenza.

E, Section of lung showing diffuse alveolar damage with hyaline membrane formation. F, Section of lung showing a massive infiltrate of neutrophils, consistent with bacterial pneumonia. (From [12] and [14], with permission.)\nIn contrast to influenza, in which fatal disease generally occurs only in infants, older persons, and persons with underlying medical conditions, severe cases of SARS frequently occurred in previously healthy individuals. However, the spectrum of radiographic changes seen in the epidemic largely resembled that observed in the swine-origin H1N1 influenza pandemic (Figure 2A, B) [16]. In both influenza and SARS, patients with severe illness show patchy, bilateral infiltrates by chest radiograph and multifocal GGO on CT. Because the radiographic findings are not specific, a diagnosis of SARS could only be made if a patient gave a history of contact with a person with a known case. However, radiography still contributed to medical management by identifying patients in need of intensive supportive care and by assessing their response to therapy [1, 17]. In contrast to severely ill patients with influenza, in many of whom influenza progressed to bacterial pneumonia, fatal cases of SARS were typically characterized by the progressive expansion of areas of GGO to involve both lungs [17]. In the only radiographic study in laboratory animals, pulmonary airspace opacities were observed in cynomolgus macaques infected with the SARS coronavirus by the respiratory route (Figure 3), but a radiologic-pathologic correlation was not obtained [18].\nFigure 2.\nOpen in new tabDownload slide\nChest radiograph (A) and CT (B) of a 46-year-old woman with SARS on day 12 of hospitalization. The radiograph shows bilateral, multifocal opacities (arrows), which appear on CT as multiple subpleural areas of ground-glass attenuation. (Courtesy of Dr. Narinder Paul, Toronto.) The similarity of these changes to those seen in swine-origin H1N1 influenza (Figure 1) illustrates the nonspecificity of radiographic findings in viral infections of the respiratory tract.\nFigure 3.\nOpen in new tabDownload slide\nPosterior-anterior and lateral radiographs of a cynomolgus macaque 6 days after infection with SARS coronavirus by the intranasal and intrabronchial routes, showing multiple areas of pulmonary opacification (arrows). (From [18].)\nSimilar to the situation with SARS and severe swine-origin H1N1 influenza, chest radiographs of patients with H5N1 avian influenza show the early development of multiple, bilateral patchy opacities, which in fatal cases, progress rapidly to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (Figure 4) [3]. The rapid development of severe, diffuse pulmonary parenchymal dysfunction is thought to reflect the propensity of the H5N1 virus to infect alveolar lining cells, in contrast to the tropism of seasonal influenza A viruses for the tracheobronchial epithelium, coupled with an intense inflammatory response [19].\nFigure 4.\nOpen in new tabDownload slide\nSequential radiographs of a 22-year-old man with H5N1 avian influenza. The film on hospital admission (A) shows bilateral perihilar patchy opacities with air bronchograms. Two days later (B), there was bilateral multifocal consolidation. On day 4, the patient showed worsening respiratory failure with features suggestive of ARDS. (From [3], with permission.)\nThe above discussion has shown that, although radiographic methods are capable of providing detailed images of the morphologic alterations that accompany severe respiratory viral infections, they provide little or no information on the pathophysiologic mechanisms responsible for such changes. In particular, it is not known whether influenza and other viral infections are initially limited to the upper respiratory tract or whether severe pulmonary involvement is the result of a more diffuse initial disease process. Similarly, the mechanisms responsible for the development of pulmonary infiltrates and GGO have not been identified, and it is not known to what extent respiratory dysfunction is the result of viral infection and injury of the respiratory tract epithelium or is induced by the local or systemic release of inflammatory mediators. The factors that predispose some patients to the development of fatal bacterial superinfection are also poorly understood. Imaging methods that are not based on tissue structural changes, but on the detection of specific biochemical processes, may be able to answer such questions.\nMOLECULAR IMAGING\nHistorically, a major goal of imaging has been to facilitate medical treatment decisions by differentiating infectious from inflammatory processes (eg, osteomyelitis from aseptic inflammation) [20]. In recent years, much of this effort has focused on the characterization of host immune responses through molecular applications of SPECT, PET, and MRI; many of these approaches could potentially be used to image respiratory viral infections (Table 1). Ideally, researchers would also use molecular imaging to directly visualize viral infections, in the way that SPECT is now being used to detect experimental mycobacterial infections with use of a bacterial thymidine kinase (TK) enzyme as the reporter molecule (Figure 5) [30].\nTable 1.\nMolecular Imaging Techniques That Are Currently Being Used to Study Host Responses to Cancer, Inflammatory and Autoimmune Diseases, and Other Medical Conditions, Which Could Also Be Applied to Research on Respiratory Viral Infections\nHost response  Imaging methods  Current status \nApoptosis resulting from infection or inflammation  SPECT imaging with 99mTc radiolabeled annexin-V for pulmonary disease [21].

The probe is 1-(2'deoxy-2'-fluoro-\u03b2-D-arabinofuranosyl) - 5-[125I]-iodouracil (125I-FIAU), which is preferentially phosphorylated by the bacterial TK over the host cell enzyme to produce SPECT signal localizing to pulmonary granulomas (arrows). (From [30].)\nIn the case of viral infections, pathogen-specific imaging would rely either on the construction of recombinant viruses encoding reporter molecules, as has been accomplished for BLI, or on the development of radiolabeled probes that are selectively retained at sites of infection (Table 2). If techniques can be devised to specifically image viral infections in large animals or humans, the eventual goal will be to visualize host responses and viral replication simultaneously, to determine the relationship between the spread of the pathogen and processes, such as the release of proinflammatory mediators, the influx of inflammatory cells, apoptosis of infected or bystander cells, and changes in vascular function. In the following sections, we review the basic principles of SPECT, PET, MRI and BLI and discuss how they could be used to enhance our understanding of influenza and other respiratory viral infections.\nTable 2.\nHypothetical Targets for Molecular Imaging in the Replication Cycle of Influenza A Viruses and the SARS Coronavirus\n  Potential imaging methods\n  Target  Influenza A viruses  SARS coronavirus \nBinding of virion to cell-surface receptor  PET or SPECT imaging using radiolabeled lectins or viral HA molecules as probes.BLI of infection by a GFP- or luciferase-encoding virus [32].

For BLI, sites of replication can be identified through the expression of a virus-encoded luciferase, GFP or other reporter molecule, as has been shown for an influenza virus encoding a chimeric NS1-GFP protein [31]. Virus-specific imaging with PET or SPECT might make use of a radiolabeled probe that binds with high affinity to a virus-specific molecule, or is selectively modified by a virus-encoded enzyme, causing it to be retained within infected cells.\nOpen in new tab\nRadionuclide Imaging\nSPECT and PET are based on the selective retention of radiotracers molecules at sites of biological interest through a broad range of mechanisms including either as a result of high-affinity binding to a chosen molecular target or through trapping in cells by mechanism pathways such as modification by a specific enzyme. PET imaging probes emit positrons, which travel a short distance in tissues before undergoing annihilation, producing 2 high-energy photons traveling in 180\u00b0 opposite directions that strike surrounding detectors simultaneously. By using highly energetic photons of a single frequency, PET reduces soft-tissue attenuation, scatter, and noise. However, a limiting factor in PET resolution is the distance that the positron must travel through tissues before undergoing annihilation. In contrast, the various radiotracers used for SPECT imaging release single photons, with a range of energies depending on the decay characteristics of the radionuclide.\nAlthough SPECT has traditionally been considered to be less quantitative and more subject to soft-tissue attenuation than PET, its use for infectious disease research is being enhanced by improved collimation, the use of CT for attenuation correction, and evolving quantitative techniques. Although not all SPECT radiotracers are used for molecular imaging, SPECT offers a wide variety of probes, because it is not limited by a requirement for positron decay. Moreover, as a cross-sectional technique, SPECT provides significant advantages over planar nuclear medicine imaging for locating sites of disease. For example, whole antibodies or antibody fragments labeled with 99mTechnetium or 111Indium can be imaged with SPECT for a broad range of potential infectious disease applications.\nThe most widely used PET radiotracer is 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG). Because deoxyglucose is taken up by cells and phosphorylated but not further metabolized, the radiotracer is selectively trapped in cells with high rates of glycolysis. FDG - PET imaging has a flourishing oncologic literature, based on the detection of active neoplasms with elevated glycolysis by combining PET with CT, which has greater sensitivity and specificity than either method alone. In contrast, relatively few data have yet been published to support a role for FDG - PET and/or CT in infectious diseases imaging. In clinical practice, FDG - PET and/or CT can also visualize inflammatory processes, both infectious and noninfectious, via nonspecific uptake of the tracer by multiple types of white blood cells, including lymphocytes and neutrophils. Therefore, FDG - PET and/or CT can theoretically be a useful tool for measuring inflammatory responses to infection [38]. For example, FDG has been used to visualize the response to the introduction of endotoxin into the lungs of human volunteers (Figure 6) [39, 40]. This suggests that FDG - PET could be particularly useful for imaging the inflammatory response to severe respiratory viral infections, because studies of human cases and experimental models in mice and ferrets indicate that acute inflammatory responses play a critical role in the severe respiratory dysfunction induced by the 1918 H1N1 and the H5N1 avian influenza viruses and by the SARS coronavirus [19, 41\u201346]. Radionuclide imaging of experimental influenza or SARS coronavirus infections could help to resolve the question of whether anti-inflammatory therapies are beneficial or harmful for these conditions [47\u201351].\nFigure 6.\nOpen in new tabDownload slide\nCT (upper row) and 18FDG-PET images of the lungs of a human volunteer before and 24 hours after an intrabronchial installation of endotoxin. The subtraction image shows an area of tracer retention representing an acute inflammatory response. Red indicates the highest and blue the lowest level of activity. (From [39], with permission.)\nFDG-PET and/or CT were recently used to study a patient with severe influenza, showing that areas of GGO seen by CT were characterized by increased radiotracer uptake (Figure 7) [52]. The same authors have also found that, in patients with acute lung injury and ARDS from causes other than viral infection, the metabolic rate of pulmonary tissues is markedly increased, even when CT shows them to be normally aerated [53]. This work suggests that FDG - PET quantitation of inflammation in infected animals could be experimentally compared with measurements of viral replication, cellular markers, and gene expression to identify relationships among these factors and pulmonary parenchymal injury.\nFigure 7.\nOpen in new tabDownload slide\nChest CT (A), 18FDG-PET scan (B), and fused image (C) of a patient with severe swine-origin H1N1 influenza and ARDS.

Red indicates the highest and blue the lowest level of radiotracer activity. (Courtesy of Giacomo Bellani.)\nBecause intravenously administered FDG is taken up and trapped nonspecifically by a wide range of white blood cells, efforts are under way to label specific populations of white blood cells in vitro. In the case of acute infection, in vitro labeling of neutrophils could be a useful method of tracking host responses [24, 54]. For example, a 64Cu-labeled peptide that targets the formyl peptide receptor on neutrophils has been used to image bacterial infections in mice [55]. Key issues include demonstrating the stability of the neutrophil-peptide complex, which affects the localization of a molecular process if the radioactive molecule fails to remain attached to the target peptide, and studying the effect on tracer uptake of increased perfusion in areas of infection [55].\nBecause the techniques just described cannot reliably distinguish between infection and other inflammatory processes, there is a need for methods that could specifically detect viral replication and track the spread of a pathogen in the respiratory tract. One possible approach would be to design radiolabeled probes that bind with high affinity to virus-encoded molecules or that are substrates for a virus-encoded enzyme (Table 2). An example of the latter is the herpesviral TK, which phosphorylates thymidine analogues that are not substrates for the host enzyme. Compounds, such as acyclovir and its analogues, can therefore be used both as antiviral drugs for the treatment of herpesviral infections and as radiolabeled tracers to detect sites of replication or recombinant TK expression [56]. The method has been used to image experimental herpesviral infections of tumors, but its use for visualizing herpesviral encephalitis has been limited by the requirement for the probe to penetrate the blood-brain barrier [57\u201359].\nThe published literature has not yet established the use of radiolabeled antiviral drugs as probes to image influenza or SARS, but opportunities might exist to use amantadine and rimantadine, which inhibit influenza viral replication by selectively occupying the M2 ion channel; oseltamivir and zanamivir, which bind to the active site of the influenza neuraminidase; and experimental drugs that inhibit the SARS coronavirus protease as imaging agents [34, 36]. PET has been used to image the distribution of radiolabeled oseltamivir in uninfected mice and of inhaled zanamivir in healthy human volunteers [60, 61]. It is interesting to speculate that these radiolabeled drugs could also be used to identify the distribution of influenza virus in the respiratory tract of patients with influenza, unless their distribution would essentially localize nonspecifically to areas of increased perfusion, as has been observed for radiolabeled ciprofloxacin in experimental bacterial infections [62].\nMagnetic Resonance Imaging\nIn MRI, exposure of the body to a combination of a strong magnetic field and pulses of radio-frequency energy induces signals that reflect the local molecular environment. In addition to providing detailed structural images, MRI can obtain information on physiologic processes through the use of contrast agents, such as superparamagnetic iron oxide (SPIO) particles, to label immune cells and the analysis of spectral data to detect and quantify specific substances in tissues. The use of MRI for the study of pulmonary disease has been significantly more limited than CT because of several challenges, including cardiac and respiratory motion, the low water content of pulmonary parenchyma, and the variable magnetic susceptibility at alveolar and bronchial structure interfaces, which produces short T2 and T2* relaxation times, lowering the signal-to-noise ratio [63]. However, technical innovations, such as respiratory gating and adjusted MRI sequences, are addressing these challenges to image pulmonary infections [64\u201366].\nMRI is now being used to track the development of pulmonary lesions and characterize inflammatory responses in murine models of bacterial infection (Figure 8A) [67\u201370]. Although MRI has been used to study the effects of influenza on the central nervous system and the heart, it has yet to be applied in published research on pulmonary influenza or other respiratory viral infections. However, advances in pulmonary MRI and MRI-compatible cell labeling are providing a unique opportunity for these studies. For example, inflammatory cells loaded ex vivo with antiviral drugs or nanoparticles have been demonstrated to localize to sites of infection [71, 72]. SPIO particles, which cause local magnetic susceptibility artifacts, are particularly useful for studying inflammatory processes, because they are detectible as dark (hypointense) regions much larger than the particles themselves, rendering them visible even when only a few cells are labeled (Figure 8B) [73]. Although promising for identifying areas of inflammation in solid organs, such as the brain, these methods may prove to be less useful for studying respiratory tract infections, because dark areas of diminished signal intensity at sites of SPIO particle uptake may resemble normal lung.\nFigure 8.\nOpen in new tabDownload slide\nIdentification by MRI of areas of inflammation in the lungs of a mouse 24 and 48 hours after an intratracheal inoculation of lipopolysaccharides, based on the uptake of 19F-labeled emulsified perfluorocarbons, which are phagocytized by monocytes and macrophages.

(From [67], with permission.)\nBioluminescence Imaging\nBecause it uses relatively inexpensive detection equipment and does not involve radioactivity, BLI is the molecular imaging method most accessible to bench researchers. The technique is based on the emission of photons of visible or near-infrared light by firefly luciferase when it is exposed to an injected bolus of its natural substrate, luciferin [74]. Because photons in this energy range are quickly absorbed as they pass through tissues, BLI studies can only be performed in small animals (predominantly in mice) with organs of interest within a few millimeters of the skin surface.\nMost investigators who have used BLI to visualize viral replication have inserted a luciferase gene into the genome of the agent of interest, a procedure that is quite straightforward for large DNA viruses, such as the poxviruses. In the case of vaccinia virus infections of the respiratory tract, the photon flux from the lungs has been shown to correlate directly with tissue viral titers, making it possible to both visualize and quantitate viral replication in living animals over the entire course of illness (Figure 9) [76, 77]. Thus, BLI has the potential to supplement or even replace some traditional research methods in which data on viral replication could only be obtained by infecting a large number of mice, sacrificing cohorts at various time points, collecting tissue samples, and determining viral titers.\nFigure 9.\nOpen in new tabDownload slide\nA, correlation of photon flux with viral titers in the organs of interferon-\u03b1 receptor knockout mice infected intranasally with a recombinant vaccinia virus encoding firefly luciferase. The animals were killed on day 7 after infection, and tissue samples were analyzed for luciferase activity and viral titer. B, BLI of the infected mice, showing the progression of infection over time (days). Red indicates the highest and blue the lowest level of radiotraceractivity. (From [75], with permission.)\nThe insertion of a reporter gene is more challenging for a small RNA virus such as influenza. However, a recombinant influenza A virus encoding a chimeric NS1-green fluorescent protein (GFP) molecule has been successfully generated and used to image the distribution of virus in the lungs of infected mice [31]. Because of the short tissue penetration of UV light and the presence of background autofluorescence, imaging could only be performed ex vivo, on excised lungs; however, the findings still provide a clear demonstration of the effect of antiviral therapy (Figure 10). A GFP-encoding SARS coronavirus has also been constructed, but luciferase-encoding coronaviruses have not been described [33, 78]. Of interest, BLI can also be used to study the bacterial pneumonia that often accompanies viral infection of the respiratory tract. By inserting a lux operon into the genome of Streptococcus pneumoniae, researchers were able to image pulmonary bacterial replication and demonstrate that pneumonia was more severe in mice that had undergone preliminary influenza virus infection than in control animals [79].\nFigure 10.\nOpen in new tabDownload slide\nEx vivo imaging of the distribution of a GFP-encoding influenza A virus in the lungs of mice 2 days after intranasal inoculation, without or with oseltamivir therapy. In the treated animals, the signal is almost entirely low-level (blue) and is localized principally to the central large airways, while the photon flux is more intense and diffuse in the untreated mice. (From [31], with permission.)\nIn addition to using BLI to visualize pathogen replication, it can also be used to study host responses to infection, by creating reporter mice, in which a luciferase gene is inserted into the animal's genome under the control of a promoter of interest [80]. For example, mice in which luciferase expression is driven by the IFN-\u03b2 promoter have been used to characterize type I IFN responses to wild-type and recombinant influenza A viruses, (Figure 11) [22, 81]. Thus, BLI makes it possible to perform a variety of studies that could serve as proofs of concept for further investigation in large animals and in humans.\nFigure 11.\nOpen in new tabDownload slide\nResponse of \u201creporter mice\u201d homozygous (left) or heterozygous (right) for firefly luciferase under the control of an IFN-\u03b2 promoter to infection with an NS1-deficient influenza A virus.

SPECT, PET, MRI, and BLI offer molecular imaging techniques that could potentiate the discovery of new biomarkers for predicting disease progression and supporting the development of novel therapies targeting viral replication or damaging host responses. Although new diseases, such as novel H1N1 influenza and SARS, will inevitably continue to emerge, molecular imaging can help to reduce their impact on public health by elucidating their pathogenetic mechanisms.\nWe thank Adolfo Garcia-Sastre, King Li, and Jim Musser, for useful discussions, and Giacomo Bellani, Bernd Ebner, and Narinder Paul, for providing images.\nReferences\n1.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), which emerged with highly contagious and life-threatening characteristics in 2002, remains a potential risk for future outbreaks. Membrane (M) and envelope (E) proteins are major structural proteins of the SARS-CoV. The M protein has been determined as a protective antigen in humoral responses. However, its potential roles in stimulating cellular immunity remain elusive.\nMethods. In this study, a panel of peptides derived from M and E proteins were tested by in vitro refolding, T2 cell-binding assays, and responses stimulated by cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) epitopes in HLA-A2.1/Kb transgenic mice and human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs).\nResults. A nonameric epitope Mn2 and a decameric epitope Md3 derived from the M protein were identified and used for the evaluation of M protein-specific immunity. Responses stimulated by M protein-specific CTL epitopes have been found in the PBMCs of donors who had recovered from SARS infection. Additionally, the transmembrane domain of the M protein may contain a T cell epitope cluster revealed by the immunogenic and structural analysis of a panel of truncated peptides overlapping with Mn2 and Md3.\nConclusions. The M protein of SARS-CoV holds dominant cellular immunogenicity. This, together with previous reports of a strong humoral response against the M protein, may help to further explain the immunogenicity of SARS and serves as potential targets for SARS-CoV vaccine design.\nTopic: coronavirus antigens epitopes t-lymphocyte epitopes hla-a2 antigen immunity immunity, cellular membrane proteins tissue membrane mice, transgenic peptides t-lymphocytes, cytotoxic infections severe acute respiratory syndrome immunity, humoral sars coronavirus peripheral blood mononuclear cell transmembrane domain transverse spin relaxation time donors immunogenicity\nIssue Section: Major Articles and Brief Reports Viruses\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) emerged in Foshan City, Guangdong Province, China, in November 2002 [1\u20133] and caused tremendous impact on the world health systems and economies because of its high transmissibility, rapid deteriorating process, and poor prognosis [4\u201310]. The etiological agent of SARS was iden- tified as a new member of human coronavirus (family Coronaviridae) named SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) [2, 3]. It has been proven that SARS-CoV may be an interspecies-transmissible virus [11\u201313]. However, the true scenario of the crossspecies transmission, virus adaptation to humans, and sudden disappearance remains mysterious because current data are limited to genetic sequence and serology [14, 15]. This indicates that SARS-CoV is still a potential reemerging pathogen and a good experimental model system for research.\nSARS-CoV causes by far the most severe disease among all human coronaviruses, a so-called cytokine storm characterized by serious lung injury (acute respiratory distress syndrome [ARDS]) [16, 17]. It is believed that the severe clinical outcome is due to the overreaction of the human immune system because the virus is relatively \u201cnew\u201d to the host, evidenced by the positive effect of corticosteroid treatment of infected patients [8]. Immune protection against SARS-CoV infection is convincingly confirmed by some experimental data [18\u201321], although the pros and cons of the host immune response contributing to the pathogenicity are controversial [16, 22, 23]. It is believed that humoral immunity plays an important role in host immune protection [18, 19], but host cellular immunity for protection against SARS-CoV infection is also recognized [20, 21]. The immune response of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) is the major specific defense against viral invasion, and a series of studies have demonstrated that human memory T cell responses to SARS-CoV persists for months to years in the absence of antigen [21, 24\u201327]. Thus, immunological monitoring of T cell immunity against SARS-CoV infection is crucial to evaluate the functions of CTLs in viral clearance and their status in immunopathogenesis.\nThe antigenicity of specific proteins within a viral proteome differs depending on the diversity of quantity and immunogenic antigenicity of the immune epitopes comprised in the proteins. It has been demonstrated that structural proteins of SARS-CoV such as spike (S), nucleocapsid (N), membrane (M), and envelope (E) proteins possess much higher immunogenicity for T cell responses than the nonstructural proteins [20]. It has been shown that the S and N proteins are characterized by high immunogenicity to engage the humoral and cellular response to SARS-CoV [19, 28]. The M and E proteins are the other 2 significant structural proteins anchoring on the envelope membrane surface of the SARS-CoV particles. The M protein is a typical transmembrane glycoprotein composed of a triplemembrane domain spanning 80 amino acids that account for about one-third of the entire protein (221 residues in total) [29]. Acting as the most abundant structural protein in the virion of SARS-CoV [29], M also plays a significant role in virus-specific humoral response and is able to elicit efficient neutralizing antibodies in SARS patients [30]. The E protein is a small integral membrane polypeptide that forms an ion channel [31]. Either the absence or inactivation of the E protein results in attenuated virulence because of the alterations in virion morphology or tropism [32, 33].\nWe previously reported an efficient strategy of screening HLA-A*0201 restricted CTL epitopes, which led to the identification of an immunodominant epitope from the S protein restricted by HLA-A*0201 [34]. Following the same strategy, in the present study we identified a CTL-related epitope clustering region containing 2 CTL epitopes restricted by HLAA* 0201 in the transmembrane domain of the M protein. The 2 epitopes have been further functionally and structurally characterized. We also found a strong response by both enzymelinked immunospot (ELISPOT) assay and human leukocyte antigen (HLA) tetramer staining in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) obtained from patients who had recovered from SARS-CoV infection. We conclude that the SARSCoV M protein acts as a dominant immunogen for both the humoral response (from previous reported data) and cellular immune response.\nMaterials and Methods\nPrediction and synthesis of candidate peptides. The potential nonamer and decamer peptides in the M and E proteins of SARS-CoV (strain TJF; GenBank accession no. AY654624) were predicted by estimating the half-life of disassociation from the HLA-A*0201 molecule through BIMAS online analysis software [35]. Fourteen peptides with high scores were synthesized and purified with a purity of \u223c90% (Table 1). HLA-A*0201-restricted epitope of influenza A matrix peptide p58\u201366 (Flu, GILGFVFTL) [36] and SARS-CoV S protein-derived peptide P15 (KLPDDFMGCV) [34] served as the positive control. The negative control was performed by simian immunodeficiency virus Mamu-A*01-restricted peptide CM9 (CTPYDINQM) [37]. These peptides were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide after synthesis and stored in aliquots at \u221280\u00b0C in a lyophilized environment.\nTable 1\nOpen in new tabDownload slide\nNOTE. FI, fluorescent index; SIV, simian immunodeficiency virus. a Estimated half-time of dissociation (T1/2) of HLA-A*0201 peptide complexes calculated using the BIMAS program (http://bimas.dcrt.nih.gov/molbio/hla_bind/index.html). b FI = (mean fluorescein isothiocyanate [FITC] fluorescence with the given peptide\u2014mean FITC fluorescence without peptide)/(mean FITC fluorescence without peptide). Fl \u2a7e 1 represents the high-affinity peptide; FI\u2a7e1 represents the low-affinity peptides.\nIn vitro refolding of the synthesized peptides with HLAA* 0201 heavy chain and \u03b22 microglobulin. HLA-A*0201 heavy chain and \u03b22 microglobulin were overexpressed as recombinant proteins in Escherichia coli and subsequently refolded in vitro and assembled in the presence of a high concentration of specific peptides as described elsewhere [38]. The refolded protein was concentrated and analyzed by Superdex 200 10/300 GL gel-filtration chromatography (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The fractionated samples were collected and analyzed with sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis to check the refolding efficiency.\nStabilization assay of HLA-A*0201 in T2 cells incubated with synthetic peptides. To further determine the binding capability of synthetic peptides to HLA-A*0201 molecules present on the cell surface, the T2 cell-binding assay was performed as described elsewhere [21, 34]. HLA-A*0201 binding peptides increased the stable expression of HLA-A*0201 molecules on the T2 cells. Briefly, T2 cells suspended in serum-free Roswell Park Memorial Institute 1640 medium (RPMI) were incubated with the peptides (50 \u03bcmol/L), supplemented with 1 \u03bcmol/L human \u03b22 microglobulin (Sigma) for 18 h at 37\u00b0C with 5% b2 CO2. The expression of HLA-A*0201 on T2 cells was determined by staining with an anti-human HLA-A2 antibody (Serotech) conjugated with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) and then analyzed by flow cytometry (FACScan; BD Biosciences). Results were calculated as the fluorescent indexes (FI), which were determined as follows: FI = (mean FITC fluorescence with the given peptide)/(mean FITC fluorescence without peptide). Peptides with FI \u2a7e 1 were arbitrarily regarded as high-affinity epitopes [34], which means that these peptides could increase the mean fluorescence of T2 cells by at least 1-fold.\nELISPOT assay for IFN-\u03b3 production. The CTL epitope- specific response was measured by performing the interferon g (IFN-\u03b3) ELISPOT assays as described elsewhere [34, 39]. The IFN-\u03b3 production after the CTL epitope stimulation is defined as CTL epitope-specific response regardless of the IFN-\u03b3 production cells. The number of spots was determined using an automatic ELISPOT reader and image analysis software (Cellular Technology Limited).\nPeptide-HLA tetramer staining. Two kinds of recombinant HLA-A*0201 heavy chain with biotin tag were used to produce major histocompatibility complex (MHC) tetramers as described elsewhere [34]: (1) wild type and (2) \u03b13 region substitution with mouse H-Kd to enhance the binding to mouse CD8 cells. In vitro biotinylation of the peptide-MHC complexes was achieved by incubating the sample with the biotin protein ligase Bir A, D-biotin, and adenosine triphosphate. The samples were purified again through gel filtration to remove free biotin, and then the multimers were produced by using streptavidin conjugated with phycoerythrin (Sigma). Cells from the subjects were stained with the tetramer (0.05 \u03bcg/\u03bcL) and FITC-conjugated anti-CD8 antibody and then immediately analyzed with flow cytometry.\nPBMCs obtained from donors previously infected with SARS. The frozen PBMCs collected from 3 HLA-A2+ patients who had been recovered from SARS for 20\u201322 months were stored in Peking Union Hospital with the donors' informed consent. The cells were thawed and incubated with 10 \u03bcmol/ L peptides and 20 U/mL recombinant human interleukin 2 in RPMI containing 10% fetal calf serum at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO2. The PBMCs of a healthy HLA-A2+ donor were obtained with informed consent. All the manipulations of human samples have been approved by an institutional ethics committee.\nInoculation of mice with peptides. The HLA-A*0201 transgenic mice with C57BL/6 background [40] were maintained in an animal care facility under pathogen-free conditions. Each experimental group contained 8 members with equivalent male and female mice and was inoculated with a different candidate peptide. The 6- to 8-week old transgenic mice were injected subcutaneously at multiple sites with candidate peptides and the N-terminal fragment N333 (23\u2013355aa) of murine gp96 [41] emulsified in complete Freund's adjuvant. Mice were administered the mixture of peptides, gp96 fragment, and incomplete Freund's adjuvant twice in 2-week intervals. Mice were killed at day 7 after the final inoculation.\nInoculation of mice with SARS-CoV membrane DNA plasmid (pD3-M). The SARS-CoV membrane gene (derived from strain TJF) was cloned in the pcDNA3-FLAG vector (pD3-M) using forward primer 5'-GCGGATCCGCCACCATGGCAGACAACGGTACTATT- 3' with a BamHI restriction site followed by a Kozak sequence and reverse primer 5'-GCCTCGAGCTGTACTAGCAAAGCAATATTGTCG- 3'. The expression of M protein coded by pD3-M in 293 T cells was confirmed by Western blot using an anti-FLAG antibody. Each transgenic mouse was injected intramuscularly with 100 \u03bcg of plasmid. The injection was administered at weeks 0, 3, and 6, and the CTL epitope- specific responses were measured 10 days after the last boost.\nX-ray crystallography. HLA-A*0201/peptide complexes were refolded and purified as described above. Crystals were grown by the hanging drop vapor diffusion method at 4\u00b0C. Single HLA- A*0201-Md3 crystals grew in a final concentration of 10 mg/mL in 0.1 mol/L BIS-TRIS pH 5.5 gel and 10% wt/ vol polyethylene glycol 3350. Single crystals of HLA- A*0201- Mn2 were grown over the course of 3 days by microseeding in a concentration of 20 mg/mL using 0.1 mol/L ammonium acetate, 0.1 mol/L BIS-TRIS, pH 6.0 gel, and 13%\u201317% polyethylene glycol 10,000. For cryoprotection, crystals were transferred to reservoir solutions containing 20% glycerol. Crystallographic data were collected at 100 K in-house on a Rigaku MicroMax007 rotating-anode X-ray generator operated at 40 kV and 20 mA (Cu K\u03b1\u03bb = 1.5418) equipped with an R-AXIS VII++ image-plate detector. Data were indexed and scaled using the DENZO program and the HKL2000 software package (HKL Research).\nStructure determination, refinement, and analysis. The structures of HLA-A*0201/Mn2 and HLA-A*0201/Md3 were determined using molecular replacement with the program MolRep. The search model was Protein Data Bank entry 1JF1 [42] with water coordinates omitted. Extensive model building was performed manually using the COOT program [43] and restrained refinement using the REFMAC5 program. The additional rounds of refinement were performed by using the PHENIX.refine program implemented in the PHENIX software package with isotropic adenosine diphosphate refinement and bulk solvent modeling [44]. The stereochemical quality of the final model was assessed with the program PROCHECK [45]. The atomic coordinates of these 2 crystal structures have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank (accession nos. 3I6G and 3I6K).\nResults\nIdentification of potential HLA-A*0201-binding peptides. The complete sequences of SARS-CoV membrane and envelope protein were analyzed with the online HLA Peptide Binding Prediction software to predict the potential HLA-A*0201-binding peptides. Fourteen candidate peptides with relatively high estimated half-time of dissociation from HLA-A*0201 were selected (Table 1). All the peptides were synthesized, with purity up to 90%. Eleven of the predicted peptides could refold into HLAA* 0201 complexes. Of these peptides, Mn2, Mn3, Md1, Md2, Md3, and En4 possess a higher affinity for binding to HLAA* 0201 molecules and the ability to assist the refolding of heavy chain with \u03b22 microglobulin (Figure 1).\nFigure 1\nOpen in new tabDownload slide\nBinding affinity of the synthesized peptides to HLA-A*0201 molecules. A, The refolding results were analyzed by fast-performance liquid chromatography Superdex 200 10/300 GL gel-filtration chromatography, which was calibrated with the standard protein marker, showing that the predicted molecular weight of the protein coming out with 15.2 mL eluting buffer would be 45 kDa, coincident with the molecular mass of the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) complex. A positive control (PC) was performed by the HLA-A*0201-restricted epitope Flu, and the negative control (NC) peptide was CM9 (Table 1). B, In the T2 cell-binding assay, the distribution histograms of cell populations are presented with different fluorescence intensity of fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-anti-HLA-A2 staining of T2 cells cocultured with PC (Flu), NC (CM9), and high-affinity (Fl \u2a7e 1) peptides Mn1, Mn2, Md2, Md3, and En4. The results are representative of 3 independent experiments.\nT2 cell-peptide binding assay. The T2 cell-peptide binding assay was used to further investigate the binding affinity of the peptides to HLA-A*0201 molecules (Figure 1). Of the 14 synthesized candidate peptides, only Mn1, Mn2, Md2, Md3, and En4 could increase the surface expression of HLA-A*0201 by >2-fold, which was demonstrated as . The FI \u2a7e of these 5 high-affinity peptides were 1.02, 1.38, 1.21, 1.54, and 1.50, respectively. The positive control Flu peptide had a high affinity, with FI = 1.41, whereas the negative control CM9 peptide had an affinity of FI = 0.02, indicating no binding ability with HLA-A*0201. The results of the HLA-A*0201 complex refolding assay and T2 cell-peptide binding assay were taken into account together, and 4 peptides-Mn2, Md2, Md3, and En4- were chosen for additional experiments in vivo.\nIn vivo generation of CTL epitope-specific CD8+ immune response in HLA-A*0201/Kb-transgenic mice inoculated with high-affinity peptides. After 3 rounds of fortnightly in vivo injections, the ELISPOT assay was performed using fresh splenocytes (Figure 2A). No specific reactivity of IFN-\u03b3 secretion could be detected in splenocytes separated from transgenic mice inoculated with either peptide Md2 or peptide En4. Thus, these 2 peptides were excluded from additional studies. CD8+ T cells from splenocytes of transgenic mice responding to peptide Md3 presented strong IFN-\u03b3 production, whereas peptide Mn2 elic ited a relative lower response. However, both of the groups inoculated with Md3 and Mn2 peptides possessed a statistically significant difference compared with the group inoculated with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). After an in vitro proliferation of the splenocytes for an additional 10 days, HLA-A*0201 tetramers of peptide Mn2 and Md3 were prepared to stain peptide- specific CD8+ T lymphocytes (presumably CTLs). The splenocytes from Mn2- and Md3-inoculated mice contained 5.2% and 8.6% of peptide-specific CD8+ T cells, respectively, after 10 days of stimulation in vitro (Figure 3A). No peptidespecific CD8+ T cells were identified from splenocytes of mice inoculated with PBS stained with either HLA-A*0201/Mn2 or HLA-A*0201/Md3 tetramer. The positive controlHLA-A*0201/ Flu tetramer showed 8.5% of Flu-specific CD8+ T cells within splenocytes stimulated in vitro from transgenic mice inoculated with Flu peptide (data not shown). These results indicated that peptides Mn2 and Md3 may induce specific CD8+ T cell immune response in vivo in transgenic mice and furthermore possess the capability to significantly stimulate specific CD8+ T cell expansion in vitro.\nFigure 2\nOpen in new tabDownload slide\nDetection of peptide-specific CD8+ T cells in HLA-A2.1/Kb transgenic mice. A, Fresh splenocytes from dead mice inoculated with peptides that had double-positive results with both refolding and T2 cellbinding assays were manipulated with the enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISPOT) assay. The bars represent the quantity of spot-forming cells (SFCs) in 105 splenocytes. The results of peptides Mn2 and Md3 consistent with the positive control Flu and the nonspecific stimulus phytohemagglutinin (PHA) have a statistically significant difference compared with the results from peptides Md2 and En4 (P < .05). B, Survey of the peptide-specific CD8+ T cells induced in HLA-A2.1/Kb transgenic mice inoculated with DNA plasmid. The mean numbers of the SFCs in 105 Mn2- and Md3- stimulated splenocytes from mice inoculated with pD3-M, represented by the gray bars, are significantly higher than the white bar, which represents the SFC numbers of Mn2- and Md3-stimulated splenocytes from mice inoculated with pcDNA3, according to the statistics. There is no statistically significant difference between the PHA-stimulated splenocytes of these 2 groups.\nFigure 3\nOpen in new tabDownload slide\nMeasurement of peptide-specific CD8+ T cells from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of donors recovered from severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) by enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISPOT) assay. The thawed PBMCs were manipulated with the ELISPOT assay kit. Shaded bars represent the mean numbers of spot-forming cells (SFCs) in the PBMCs of HLA-A2+ recovered donors, whereas white bars represent the PBMCs from HLA-A2+ healthy donors. The former differs statistically from the latter when stimulated with the peptides. Nevertheless, no difference has been shown between them when stimulated with nonspecific stimulus phytohemagglutinin (PHA).\nDetection of CTL epitope-specific CD8+ T cell immune response in HLA-A*0201/Kb-transgenic mice inoculated with DNA vaccine. To further demonstrate whether peptides Mn2 and Md3 were naturally processed and presented peptides, we constructed a DNA vaccine encoding SARS-CoV M protein: pD3-M. Splenocytes isolated from the dead mice after the third boost of the pD3-M DNA vaccine were analyzed with the ELISPOT assay. The results of the ELISPOT assay showed that Mn2 and Md3 could induce high IFN-\u03b3 production by specific CD8+ T cells in freshly isolated splenocytes of transgenic mice (Figure 2B). These results suggested that peptides Mn2 and Md3 could be naturally processed in vivo and induce specific CD8+ T cell immune responses (presumably mainly CTLs).\nPresence of peptide-specific CD8+ T cells in PBMCs obtained from donors recovered from SARS infection. In the ELISPOT assays, peptides Mn2 and Md3 elicited high IFN-\u03b3 release from specific T cells in PBMCs obtained from recovered donors (Figure 4). Peptide Mn2 pulsed a specific T cell response by IFN-\u03b3 production, with a mean number of 34.8\u00b119.7 spot-forming cells per 105 PBMCs. Likewise, for peptide Md3, the mean number is 44.1 \u00b1 10.8 cells per 105 PBMCs. Peptide P15 (KLPDDFMGCV) from the SARS S protein, the positive control in parallel assays, provoked similar specific CD8+ T cell responses, with a statistical number of 38.0 \u00b1 14.1 spot-forming cells per 105 PBMCs. Such T cell responses were not observed in the PBMCs donated from the control patients. Tetramers of peptides Mn2 and Md3 were also prepared to stain CD8+ T lymphocytes bearing the peptide-specific T cell receptors (TCRs). Through the peptide-specific tetramer staining and subsequent flow cytometry analysis, the PBMCs obtained from recovered donors possessed CD8+ T lymphocytes specific for peptides Mn2 and Md3 after 20\u201322 months from the onset of the disease. These 2 peptide tetramers showed 1.2% and 1.4% of specific T cells in the CD8+ T lymphocytes, respectively, from the PBMCs of recovered donors (Figure 3B). However, no peptide-specific CD8+ T cells were excavated from the PBMCs of the 3 healthy donors.\nFigure 4\nOpen in new tabDownload slide\nFrequency of Mn2- and Md3-specific CD8+ T cells. A, In the tetramer staining, the splenocytes from mice inoculated with peptides were cultured in vitro for 10 days. Next, the cells were stained with phycoerythrin (PE)-labeled HLA-A*0201/peptide chimeric tetramer together with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-labeled anti-mouse CD8 antibody. Top left: Mn2-inoculated mice stained with Mn2 tetramer. Top right: Phosphatebuffered saline (PBS)-inoculated mice stained with Mn2 tetramer. Bottom left: Md3-inoculated mice stained with Md3 tetramer. Bottom right: PBS-inoculated mice stained with Md3 tetramer. The results are representatives of 3 independent experiments. B, Mn2-specific (top left) and Md3-specific (bottom left) CD8+ T cells were detected from the thawed peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of HLA-A2+ donors recovered from severe acute respiratory syndrome, by staining with fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled anti-CD8 mAb along with PE-labeled HLA-A*0201/peptide tetramers. No specific CD8+ T cells were stained with Mn2 (top right) or Md3 tetramers among HLA-A2+ healthy donors (bottom right).\nStructural evidence of peptide presentation of both Mn2 and Md3 by HLA-A*0201/ microglobulin. To further confirm that Mn2 and Md3 are typical HLA-A2-restricted epitopes, the crystal structures of peptides Mn2 and Md3 bound to HLA-A2 were solved at 2.2 and 2.8 \u00c5 resolutions, respectively. The statistics of the complex data are shown in Table 2.\nTable 2\nOpen in new tabDownload slide\nThis table is available in its entirety in the online version of Journal of Infectious Diseases.\nFor both complexes, unambiguous electron density is observed for the bound peptides, which are well defined inside the peptide-binding grooves of HLA-A*0201 (Figure 5A, 5B, 5C, and 5D). The residues in position 2 from the N-terminus and the C-terminal are similar for both peptides, with L2 deeply buried in the B pocket and V9 (for Mn2) or V10 (for Md3) in the F pocket, indicating typical anchor residues [42]. Residues in positions 3 and 6 are commonly secondary anchors in some HLA-A*0201 complexes. For position 3, M3 of peptide Mn2 inserts into the D pocket, and for position 6, S6 of peptide Mn2 and L7 of peptide Md3 point their side chains into pocket C. All of these anchor residues help the peptides tightly bind the HLA-A*0201 heavy chain and enhance the stability of the entire complex. Amino acids W4, L5, Y7, F8 of Mn2, and C4 and V6 of Md3 protrude their side chains away from the HLA-A* 0201 surface and might be involved in the TCR docking (Figure 5C, 5D, and 5F). Like other decameric HLA-A*0201 restricted epitopes, the bulge conformation of Md3 is also observed to be drastically different from the extended conformation of nonamer Mn2. This is especially apparent around the central residues of the peptides of the main chains. Md3 is raised up \u223c2.25 \u00c5 (distance between carbonyl carbon atom of residues in position 5: L5 of Mn2 and V6 of Md3) compared with Mn2 (Figure 5E). These conformational differences between Mn2 and Md3 might partially contribute to the variances in the T cell recognition of these peptides, which lead to the immunogenic diversity of the peptides.\nFigure 5\nOpen in new tabDownload slide\nStructures of HLA-A*0201 complexed with Mn2 (GLMWLSYFV) and Md3 (TLACFVLAAV). Structural overviews of HLA-A2 with peptides Mn2 (A) and Md3 (B) demonstrate that both have 2 molecules in 1 asymmetric unit. 2Fo-Fc electron density for Mn2 (C) and Md3 (D) peptides are shown as violet and blue wire (contoured at 1.0 \u03b4) viewed in profile through the HLA-A2 \u03b12 helix. The carbon atoms are shown as yellow and green for Mn2 and Md3, respectively. E, Comparison of Mn2 (yellow) and Md3 (green) peptide structures by superimposition of the second residues from the N-terminal residues (Leu) and the C-terminal residues (Val). F, General side chain orientation for the 2 peptides as viewed in profile from the peptide N terminus toward the C terminus (up is toward the T cell receptor; down is toward the floor of the peptide binding groove; left is toward the a1 helix domain; right is toward the \u03b12 helix domain). The figure was generated using the PyMOL program (http://www.pymol.org/).\nDiscussion\nClearance of viruses from infected patients depends not only on neutralizing antibodies but also on the optimal CTLs. The SARS-CoV M protein has been proven to induce strong neutralizing antibodies [30]. As most parts of the M protein are located inside the cell or virion and are triply embedded in the cellular or viral membrane, the M protein is most likely a good target for the CD8+ T cells because it is treated as an internal gene. Therefore, CTL epitopes might be found in theMprotein, as well as in the E protein (which may also be considered an internal gene). In this study, 2 CTL epitopes restricted by HLAA* 0201 have been identified from the M protein, using an optimized rational strategy covering functional and structural approaches. Epitope candidates were initially selected through online motif prediction on the basis of computer algorithms and then tested with in vitro refolding, T2 cell binding, and animal vaccination. Finally, these 2 defined Mn2 and Md3 epitopes, presented by HLA-A*0201 as a tetramer, can be recognized by specific CD8+ T cells in the PBMCs obtained from donors recovered from SARS infection 20 months after the initial onset of the disease.\nIn addition to all these functional studies, we determined the 3-dimensional structures of the peptide-HLA complexes containing Mn2 and Md3. As shown in the peptide-HLA struc tures, Mn2 and Md3 lie in the grooves formed by HLA heavy chains in a similar conformation, with 2 anchor residues inserting deep into the binding pockets, as seen in other typical HLA-A*0201-restricted epitopes. The analysis of the 2 structures not only confirms that Mn2 and Md3 possess structural properties typical of HLA-A*0201-restricted epitopes but also determines that they are minimal stimulatory peptides, because both use the C-terminal residue to anchor in pocket F of the heavy chain.\nFurthermore, we have analyzed the immunogenic features of a panel of Mn2 and Md3 derived peptides (which means 1 amino acid deletion or addition around the defined epitopes) to see whether these regions are T cell epitope hot spots (unpublished data). Indeed, they could induce CD8+ T cell reaction from the transgenic mice inoculated with pD3-M. The crystal structure of the HLA-A2 complexed to peptide Md3-C9 (LACFVLAAV), equivalent to 9 residues in the C-terminal of Md3, revealed a distinct conformation of the peptide, which may demonstrate that this peptide acts as a new epitope in a different way with Md3 (nonamer versus decamer epitopes). All of these assays may reveal that the transmembrane domain of M protein contains a T cell epitope cluster that contributes significantly to the M protein-specific cellular immunity.\nIn general, protective memory immunity could be detected for a long period after the onset of viral diseases. Unfortunately, it has been reported that the geometric mean reciprocal titers of SARS-CoV-specific immunoglobulin G and neutralizing antibodies dropped significantly to a very low level in the 30th month after infection and were even undetectable in some proportion of the samples [46]. However, studies of the cellular immune response demonstrated that memory CD8+ T cells could be detectable from recovered donors years after the onset of the disease [21, 24, 47]. Long-term existence of cellular immunity was also observed in the studies of the SARS-CoV N protein-specific immunity [47]. In this study, CD8+ T cells against the M protein (as shown with peptides Mn2 and Md3) and against the S protein (as shown with peptide P15) [34] still existed in the PBMCs of recovered donors 20 months after infection.\nIn conclusion, this study has successfully identified a novel and defined CTL epitope clustering region containing 2 novel HLA-A*0201-restricted, immunogenic CTL epitopes from the M protein (Figure 6). Taking the earlier reports into account that the M protein induces strong neutralizing antibodies [18, 30, 48], we propose that the M protein could be a good candidate antigen for a prophylactic vaccine inducing both dominant cellular and humoral immunogenicity. Our current and previous studies [34, 49] also indicate that the combination of bioinformatics, cell biology, mouse model, and structural biology is a good method to evaluate the CTL epitope-specific immune response.\nAcknowledgements\nWe thank Dr Christopher J.

The newly emerged influenza A(H1N1) virus (new H1N1 virus) is causing the first influenza pandemic of this century. Three influenza pandemics of the previous century caused variable mortality, which largely depended on the development of severe pneumonia. However, the ability of the new H1N1 virus to cause pneumonia is poorly understood.\nMethods. The new H1N1 virus was inoculated intratracheally into ferrets. Its ability to cause pneumonia was compared with that of seasonal influenza H1N1 virus and highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 virus by using clinical, virological, and pathological analyses.\nResults. Our results showed that the new H1N1 virus causes pneumonia in ferrets intermediate in severity between that caused by seasonal H1N1 virus and by HPAI H5N1 virus. The new H1N1 virus replicated well throughout the lower respiratory tract and more extensively than did both seasonal H1N1 virus (which replicated mainly in the bronchi) and HPAI H5N1 virus (which replicated mainly in the alveoli). High loads of new H1N1 virus in lung tissue were associated with diffuse alveolar damage and mortality.\nConclusions. The new H1N1 virus may be intrinsically more pathogenic for humans than is seasonal H1N1 virus.\nTopic: influenza pulmonary alveoli bronchi ferrets avian influenza pneumonia viruses pandemics influenza a virus, h1n1 subtype influenza a virus, h5n1 subtype highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses\nIssue Section: Major Articles\nA new influenza A virus of the subtype H1N1 (new H1N1 virus) that first emerged in Mexico at the beginning of 2009 is the first pandemic human influenza virus of the 21st century. Studies have concluded that this virus probably originated from a domestic swine reservoir on the basis of its genetic signature [1, 2]. On 11 June 2009, the World Health Organization declared phase 6 of the global pandemic alert level [3]. As of 25 August 2009, more than 182,166 cases, including 1799 deaths, in 177 countries have been officially reported [4].\nA new influenza A virus of the subtype H1N1 (new H1N1 virus) that first emerged in Mexico at the beginning of 2009 is the first pandemic human influenza virus of the 21st century. Studies have concluded that this virus probably originated from a domestic swine reservoir on the basis of its genetic signature [1, 2]. On 11 June 2009, the World Health Organization declared phase 6 of the global pandemic alert level [3]. As of 25 August 2009, more than 182,166 cases, including 1799 deaths, in 177 countries have been officially reported [4].\nThe main concerns about a new influenza pandemic are the disease burden and associated mortality it may cause. These are largely due to pneumonia resulting from extension of the viral infection to the lower respiratory tract. The initial lung damage may be complicated by concomitant or subsequent bacterial pneumonia, which has been shown to be a major cause of mortality during the Spanish influenza epidemic in 1918, before the use of antibiotics [5]. In the current outbreak of new H1N1 influenza, bacterial coinfection was registered in only 20% of the cases investigated [6]. In contrast to the damage caused by the virus infection to the tracheobronchial epithelium in uncomplicated influenza, damage to the alveolar epithelium has severe consequences for the gas exchange function of the respiratory tract. It allows fluid from the alveolar capillaries to flood the alveolar lumina, causing severe\u2014and in some cases fatal\u2014respiratory dysfunction [7].\nOn the basis of the observed relatively low case fatality rate in humans, it is assumed that the virulence of the new H1N1 virus is low. However, it is acknowledged that these figures are uncertain because of too limited data [8]. Therefore, the potential of the new H1N1 virus to cause lower respiratory tract disease in humans is still poorly understood. In a previous publication, we used intranasal inoculation of influenza virus into ferrets mainly to model the transmission of the new H1N1 virus in humans [9]. Here, we use intratracheal inoculation of influenza virus into ferrets as a model of influenza pneumonia in humans. This intratracheal route of inoculation is an appropriate model of infection in humans, which is commonly thought to occur through inhalation of infectious droplets or airborne droplet nuclei [10]. We have used this route of inoculation successfully in previous studies involving both ferrets [11] and macaques [12] to model viral pneumonia. Our results showed that the severity of pneumonia caused by the new H1N1 virus was intermediate between that caused by sea sonal H1N1 virus and by highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) A(H5N1) virus.\nMethods\nVirus preparation. Three viruses were used: the new H1N1 virus (A/Netherlands/602/2009), isolated from a specimen from a human patient who had recently visited Mexico; seasonal H1N1 virus (A/Netherlands/26/2007), isolated from a patient during the 2006-2007 influenza season; and HPAI H5N1 virus (influenza A/Indonesia/5/2005), as described elsewhere [9].\nStudy design. For the survival study, groups of 3 ferrets (for seasonal H1N1 virus) or 6 ferrets (for new H1N1 and HPAI H5N1 viruses) with a temperature logger in the peritoneal cavity were inoculated intratracheally with each of these 3 viruses at each of the following doses in a 3-mL volume: 104, 106, and 108 median tissue culture infective dose (TCID50)of virus. After inoculation, they were monitored daily for clinical signs until maximally 7 days after inoculation [11]. For the pneumonia study, groups of 3 ferrets (for seasonal H1N1 virus) or 6 ferrets (for new H1N1 and HPAI H5N1 viruses) were inoculated intratracheally with 106 TCID50 of virus and euthanized at 4 days after inoculation or earlier when they were moribund before that time point. Necropsies were performed, and samples were obtained from both respiratory and extra- respiratory tissues for virological, pathological, and immunohistochemical analyses.\nFerrets. The experiments were performed under biosafety level 3 conditions at the Netherlands Vaccine Institute under an animal study protocol approved by the Institutional Animal Welfare Committee. Thirteen-month-old purpose-bred ferrets that were seronegative for antibody against circulating influenza viruses and Aleutian disease virus were maintained in standard housing and provided with commercial food pellets and water ad libitum until the start of the experiment. All ferrets were female (body weight, 815\u20131110 g) except for 1 male each in the new H1N1 virus and seasonal H1N1 virus groups of the pneumonia study (body weight, 1150 and 1290 g, respectively). Two weeks before infection, the animals were anesthetized using a cocktail of ketamine (Nimatek; Eurovet Animal Health BV) and domitor (Orion Pharma), and a temperature logger (data storage tag micro-T ultra small temperature logger; Star-Oddi) was placed in the peritoneal cavity. This device recorded the body temperature of the animals every 15 min.\nPathology. Three animals from each group were euthanized by exsanguination under ketamine anesthesia at 4 or 7 days after inoculation, and necropsies were performed according to a standard protocol. The trachea was clamped off so that the lungs would not deflate upon opening the pleural cavity, which allowed visual estimation of the area of affected lung parenchyma. Samples for histological examination were stored in 10% neutral-buffered formalin (lungs after inflation with formalin), embedded in paraffin, sectioned at 4 \u03bcm, and stained with hematoxylin and eosin for examination by light microscopy. The following tissues were examined by light microscopy: left lung (cranial and caudal lobe), nasal turbinate, nasal septum, larynx, trachea, bronchus, tracheobronchial lymph node, eyelid, tonsil, heart, liver, spleen, kidney, pancreas, duodenum, jejunum, colon, adrenal gland, and brain. Samples were obtained from the lungs in a standardized way, not guided by changes as seen in the gross pathology.\nSemiquantitative assessment of influenza virus-associated inflammation in the lung was performed as reported elsewhere [13] for the alveoli. For the degree of inflammation in the bronchi and bronchioles, we used (1) <10% of the bronchial and bronchiolar epithelium inflamed, (2) 10%\u201350% of the bronchial and bronchiolar epithelium inflamed, and (3) >50% of the bronchial and bronchiolar epithelium inflamed. For the severity of inflammation in the bronchi and bronchioles, we scored (1) peribronchial and peribronchiolar infiltrates, (2) mild necrosis and moderate numbers of inflammatory cells with scant exudate, and (3) marked necrosis and large numbers of inflammatory cells with abundant exudate. Microscopy slides were examined without knowledge of the identity of the animals. The cumulative scores for size and severity of inflammation provided the total score per animal.\nImmunohistochemical analysis. For detection of influenza A virus antigen, tissues were stained with a primary antibody against the influenza A nucleoprotein as described elsewhere [14]. Semiquantitative assessment of influenza virus antigen expression in the lungs was performed as reported elsewhere [13] for the alveoli. For the bronchi and bronchioles, the percentage of positively staining bronchial and bronchiolar epithelium was estimated on every slide, and the average of the 4 slides was taken to provide the score per animal. For phenotyping of alveolar epithelial cells we used a destaining-restaining technique described elsewhere [15].\nVirology. Virus titers were determined by virus isolation in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells. Upon necropsy, samples of \u223c0.1 g of the cranial, median, and caudal lobe of the right lung and of the accessory lobe from each animal were collected (total average weight of \u223c0.4\u20130.5 g per animal), pooled and homogenized with a FastPrep homogenizer (MP Biomedicals) in 3 mL transport medium. Quadruplicate 10-fold serial dilutions of these samples were cultured on Madin-Darby canine kidney cells [16]. Samples were obtained from the lungs in a standardized way, not guided by changes as seen in the gross pathology.\nStatistical analysis. We used 1-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Tukey multiple comparisons of means to compare body temperature, relative lung weight, lung virus titer, percentage of affected lung parenchyma, and histological and immunohistochemical scores at different levels of the lower respiratory tract for comparing the scores of pulmonary lesions and viral antigen expression. Differences were considered significant at P <.05.\nResults\nThe cumulative mortality rate of ferrets inoculated with the new H1N1 virus increased progressively from 0% at a dose of 104 TCID50 to 80% at a dose of 108 TCID50 and was intermediate between the cumulative mortality rate for infection with seasonal H1N1 virus and that for infection with HPAI H5N1 virus (Figure 1). On the basis of these data, the estimated median lethal dose was \u223c104 TCID50 for the HPAI H5N1 virus, \u223c107 TCID50 for the new H1N1 virus, and >108 TCID50 for the seasonal H1N1 virus. Because the inoculation dose of 106 TCID50 allowed the best discrimination in cumulative mortality rate between the 3 viruses, we performed additional comparative clinical, pathological, and virological studies on ferrets inoculated with this dose.\nFigure 1.\nOpen in new tabDownload slide\nCumulative mortality rates of ferrets inoculated with different influenza viruses. Ferrets were intratracheally inoculated with seasonal H1N1 (n = 3), new H1N1 (n = 6), or highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 (n = 6) influenza viruses at a dose of 104 (A), 106 (B), or 108 (C) median tissue culture infective dose (TCID50). Cumulative mortality for new H1N1 virus was intermediate between that for seasonal H1N1 virus and that for HPAI H5N1 virus.\nClinical signs were observed in all ferrets inoculated with 106 TCID50 of the new H1N1 virus from 1 day after inoculation onward; these signs included lethargy, loss of appetite, dyspnea, and raised body temperature (Figure 2A). In contrast, the seasonal H1N1 virus group showed no obvious clinical signs at any time point after inoculation. The body temperature in the new H1N1 virus group was significantly higher than that in the seasonal H1N1 virus group at 1 day (P = .02) and 2 days after inoculation (P = .04; Tukey test). The HPAI H5N1 virus group showed more severe clinical signs than did the new H1N1 virus group, and all ferrets died or were euthanized because of their moribund state by 3 days after inoculation. The increase in body temperature of the HPAI H5N1 virus group was comparable to that in the new H1N1 virus group at 1 day after inoculation; at later time points, it decreased due to the progressively moribund state of the ferrets. The mean loss in body weight \u00b1 standard deviation was 14% \u00b1 5.3% in the new H1N1 virus group and 8% \u00b1 5.6% in the seasonal H1N1 virus group at 4 days after inoculation. Sneezing was not observed in any of the ferrets.\nFigure 2.\nOpen in new tabDownload slide\nBody temperatures, relative lung weights and lung viral titers of ferrets inoculated with different influenza viruses. The ferrets were intratracheally inoculated with seasonal H1N1 (n = 3), new H1N1 (n = 6) or highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 (n = 6)influenza viruses at a dose of 106 median tissue culture infective dose (TCID50). The increase in body temperature (A), the relative lung weight (B), and the lung viral titer (C) of the new H1N1 virus group were intermediate between those of the seasonal H1N1 virus group and that of the HPAI H5N1 virus group.\nAt necropsy on day 4 after inoculation, the relative lung weights (Figure 2B) and the lung virus titers (Figure 2C)of the new H1N1 virus group were intermediate between those of the seasonal H1N1 virus and those of the HPAI H5N1 virus group. The relative lung weights among the 3 virus groups were significantly different (P = .001 ; ANOVA, F = 18.1 ), with the relative lung weight of the HPAI H5N1 virus group significantly higher (P = .006; Tukey test) than that of the new H1N1 virus group. Lung virus titers among the 3 virus groups were significantly different (P = .001 ; ANOVA, F = 17.4 ), with lung viral titer of the new H1N1 virus group significantly higher (P=.05; Tukey test) than that of the seasonal H1N1 virus group.\nAll ferrets inoculated with the new H1N1 virus had multifocal or coalescing pulmonary lesions, which were dark red, raised, and firmer than normal (Figure 3). The percentage of lung parenchyma affected by this consolidation among the 3 virus groups was significantly different (P = .0003; ANOVA, F = 42.5). The percentage of affected lung parenchyma in the new H1N1 virus group (range, 20%\u201370%) was intermediate between that of the seasonal H1N1 virus group (range, 0%\u2013 10%; P = .002; Tukey test) and that of the HPAI H5N1 virus group (80%\u2013100%; P = .01 ; Tukey test).\nFigure 3.\nOpen in new tabDownload slide\nMacroscopy, histopathology, and immunohistochemistry in the lungs of ferrets inoculated with different influenza viruses. The severity of macroscopic lung lesions (top row) in the new H1N1 virus group were intermediate between those in the seasonal H1N1 and the highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 virus groups. The new H1N1 virus group showed moderate influenza virus expression (IHC) in bronchi, bronchioles, and alveoli, associated with histological lesions (HE) characterized by inflammatory cell infiltrates and epithelial necrosis. In contrast, the seasonal H1N1 virus group showed minimal influenza virus expression and histological lesions. In the HPAI H5N1 virus group, there was more abundant influenza virus antigen expression in the alveoli associated with more severe histological lesions, but less abundant influenza virus antigen expression in the bronchi and bronchioles, associated with milder histological lesions.

HE, hematoxylin-eosin; IHC, immunohistochemistry with 3-amino-9-ethylcarbazole substrate and hematoxylin counterstain.\nOn histopathological examination, the alveoli of both the new H1N1 virus group and the HPAI H5N1 virus group showed diffuse alveolar damage (Figures 3 and 4A), whereas the alveoli of the seasonal H1N1 virus group did not. This lesion was characterized by flooding of alveolar lumina with alveolar macrophages, neutrophils, and erythrocytes, mixed with fibrin, edema fluid, and cellular debris. The alveolar walls were thickened and had necrosis of the lining epithelium and multifocal type 2 pneumocyte hyperplasia. Qualitatively, the alveolar parenchyma of the new H1N1 virus group had more infiltration by inflammatory cells, whereas that of the HPAI H5N1 virus group had more necrosis and edema.\nFigure 4.\nOpen in new tabDownload slide\nDiffuse alveolar damage in a ferret inoculated with new H1N1 virus.

In the bronchiolar lumen, there were moderate numbers of macrophages, neutrophils, and erythrocytes, mixed with fibrin, edema fluid, and cellular debris. Few bronchi had peribronchial infiltrates with moderate numbers of lymphocytes, macrophages, and few plasma cells and macrophages; in the bronchial lumina were moderate amounts of cellular debris, fibrin, edema and few neutrophils. In the HPAI H5N1 and seasonal H1N1 virus groups, the bronchiolar and bronchial lesions were less severe overall than those in the new H1N1 virus group.\nQuantitative histological scoring showed that the alveolar lesions in the new H1N1 virus group were intermediate in severity between those of the seasonal H1N1 virus group and those of the HPAI H5N1 virus group, and that the bronchiolar lesions in the new H1N1 virus group were the most severe of all 3 groups (Figure 5). The histological scores among the 3 virus groups differed significantly for the alveoli ( P = .02; ANOVA, F = 6.6), bronchioles (P = .003; ANOVA, F = 11.7 ), and bronchi (P = .002; ANOVA, F = 14.2 ). The HPAI H5N1 group had significantly higher histological alveolar scores than did the seasonal H1N1 group (P = .02; Tukey test). The new H1N1 group had higher histological bronchiolar scores than did the HPAI H5N1 group (P = .003; Tukey test) and the seasonal H1N1 group (P = .02; Tukey test). Both the new H1N1 group (P = .002; Tukey test) and the seasonal H1N1 group (P = .02; Tukey test) had significantly higher histological bronchial scores than did the HPAI H5N1 group.\nFigure 5.\nOpen in new tabDownload slide\nHistological and immunohistochemical scoring in the lungs of ferrets inoculated with different influenza viruses. Histological scoring of samples stained with hematoxylin-eosin (HE) showed that the alveolar lesions in the new H1N1 virus group were intermediate in severity between those of the seasonal H1N1 virus group and the highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 virus group, and that the bronchiolar lesions in the new H1N1 virus group were the most severe of all 3 groups. Scoring of the immunohistochemical analysis (IHC) showed that influenza virus antigen expression in the new H1N1 virus group was high in alveoli, bronchioles, and bronchi. In the HPAI H5N1 virus group, the scores were highest for alveoli and lower in bronchioles and bronchi. In the seasonal H1N1 virus group, scores were low at all 3 levels.\nOn immunohistochemical analysis, influenza virus antigen expression was visible as diffuse-to-granular red staining, which usually was stronger in the nucleus than in the cytoplasm (Figure 3). Influenza virus antigen expression was closely associated with the presence of histological lesions at different levels of the lower respiratory tract. In the new H1N1 virus and HPAI H5N1 virus groups, influenza virus antigen expression was seen predominantly in type 1 and 2 pneumocytes (Figure 4B and 4C), alveolar macrophages, bronchiolar epithelial cells, and bronchial epithelial cells. In the seasonal H1N1 virus group, influenza virus antigen expression was seen in the same cell types but was rare at any level of the lower respiratory tract. Quantitative scoring showed that influenza virus antigen expression in the new H1N1 virus group was high at all 3 levels of the lower respiratory tract (alveoli, bronchioles, and bronchi) (Figure 5). This contrasted to the influenza virus antigen expression in the HPAI H5N1 virus group, which was highest in alveoli, and lower in bronchioles and bronchi; and with that in the seasonal H1N1 virus group, which was most prominent in bronchi, but low at all 3 levels. The immunohistochemical scores among the 3 virus groups differed significantly for the alveoli (P < .001 ; ANOVA, F = 217 ) and bronchi (P = .01 ; ANOVA, F = 8.0). The new H1N1 virus group had significantly higher immunohistochemical scores than the seasonal H1N1 virus group for alveoli (P <.001 ; Tukey test) and bronchi (P = .01 ; Tukey test), and significantly higher immunohistochemical bronchial scores than did the HPAI H5N1 virus group (P = .03; Tukey test). The HPAI H5N1 group had significantly higher immunohistochemical alveolar scores than did the seasonal H1N1 group (P = .001 ; Tukey test). None of the ferrets in the seasonal H1N1 virus and new H1N1 virus groups had significant lesions or influenza virus antigen expression in extrarespiratory tissues, which is a hallmark of infection of ferrets with HPAI H5N1 virus A/Indonesia/5/2005 [17, 18].\nDiscussion\nTo cause a major pandemic, a newly emerging influenza virus needs to be not only efficiently transmissible among humans, but it also must be able to cause severe pneumonia. The former has been demonstrated by epidemiological analysis of its spread in the human population, which provided R0 estimates in the range of 1.4-1.6, comparable with lower R0 estimates obtained from previous pandemics [8]. This was corroborated by our previous study, which showed ferret-to-ferret transmission of new H1N1 virus was equally efficient as that of a seasonal H1N1 virus on intranasal inoculation [9, 19].\nHere we show that the new H1N1 virus is not only efficiently transmissible but is also able to cause severe pneumonia in ferrets. With other factors held constant, the new H1N1 virus causes pneumonia that is intermediate in severity between that caused by seasonal H1N1 virus and that caused by HPAI H5N1 virus. The new H1N1 virus shares with HPAI H5N1 virus the ability to replicate well in epithelial cells in the lower respiratory tract and to cause diffuse alveolar damage. Our results correspond with those of Itoh et al [20], who found that ferrets inoculated intranasally with new H1N1 influenza virus showed more severe bronchopneumonia than those inoculated with a recent seasonal H1N1 virus.\nBecause the pattern of influenza virus attachment to the lower respiratory tract is similar for ferrets and humans [21], and because influenza-associated disease in ferrets resembles that in humans [22], a similar pattern of infection and associated disease by the new H1N1 virus may also be expected to occur in humans. This is corroborated by the clinical characterization of patients with confirmed fatal infection with new H1N1 virus, for whom acute respiratory distress syndrome was the most frequent diagnosis [6].\nThe warning from this study\u2014with the caveat that no animal model is able to capture all aspects of the human disease\u2014is the intrinsic ability of the new H1N1 virus to cause more severe pneumonia than seasonal H1N1 virus. This fact needs to be taken into account in ongoing pandemic preparedness planning. Furthermore, regular evaluation of the severity of the pneumonia caused by the new H1N1 virus in this ferret model will provide valuable information about possible changes in virulence as this newly emerged virus further adapts to its human host.\nAcknowledgments\nWe thank W. van Aert, R.
