Since the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2003, Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH) in Singapore has routinely fit-tested staff for high filtration N95 respirators, and established web-based staff surveillance systems. The routine systems were enhanced in response to Singapore\u2019s first imported COVID-19 case on January 23,2020.\nMethods\nWe conducted a cross-sectional study, from January 23,2020 to February 23,2020, among healthcare workers to evaluate the effectiveness of the staff protection and surveillance strategy in TTSH, a 1600-bed multidisciplinary acute-care hospital co-located with the 330-bed National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID). As of February 23,2020, TTSH/NCID has managed 76% of confirmed COVID-19 cases in Singapore. The hospital adopted a multi-pronged approach to protect and monitor staff with potential COVID-19 exposures:(1) Risk-based personal protective equipment, (2) Staff fever and sickness surveillance, and (3) Enhanced medical surveillance of unwell staff.\nResults\nA total of 10,583 staff were placed on hospital-wide fever and sickness surveillance, with 1,524 frontline staff working in COVID-19 areas under close surveillance. Among frontline staff, a median of eight staff illness episodes was seen per day, and almost 10% (n=29) resulted in hospitalization. None of the staff was found to be infected with COVID-19.\nConclusions\nA robust staff protection and health surveillance system that is routinely implemented during non-outbreak periods and enhanced during the COVID-19 outbreak is effective in protecting frontline staff from the infection.\nCOVID-19, novel coronavirus, surveillance, healthcare workers\nTopic: disease outbreaks health personnel singapore body temperature temperature surveillance, medical illness sars-cov-2 covid-19\nIssue Section: Major Article\nPDF\nThis content is only available as a PDF.\n\u00a9 The Author(s) 2020.

Here we applied household cohort study to determine the features of household transmission of COVID-19.\nMethods\nTotal 105 index patients and 392 household contacts were enrolled. Both index patients and household members were inspected by SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR. The information of all recruited people was extracted from medical records and confirmed or supplemented by telephone interviews. The baseline characteristics of index cases and contact patients were described. Secondary attack rates of SARS-CoV-2 to the contact members were computed and the risk factors for transmission within household were estimated.\nResults\nSecondary transmission of SARS-CoV-2 developed in 64 of 392 household contacts (16.3%). The secondary attack rate to children was 4% comparing with 17.1% to adults. The secondary attack rate to the contacts within the households with index patients quarantined by themselves since onset of symptoms was 0% comparing with 16.9% to the contacts without index patients quarantined. The secondary attack rate to contacts who were spouses of index cases was 27.8% comparing with 17.3% to other adult members in the households.\nConclusion\nThe secondary attack rate of SARS-CoV-2 in household is 16.3%. Ages of household contacts and spouse relationship with index case are risk factors for transmission of SARS-CoV-2 within household. Quarantine of index patients at home since onset of symptom is useful to prevent the transmission of SARS-Co-2 within household.\nHousehold transmissionCOVID-19Novel coronavirus pneumoniaSARS-CoV-2\nTopic: medical records coronavirus adult child china quarantine reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction spouse telephone viruses severe acute respiratory syndrome secondary attack rate symptom onset sars-cov-2 covid-19\nIssue Section: Major Article\nPDF\nThis content is only available as a PDF.\n\u00a9 The Author(s) 2020.

This study aimed to analyze the changing patterns and the tempo-geographic features of the COVID-19 epidemic, to provide further evidence for real-time responses.\nMethods\nDaily data on COVID-2019 cases between 31st Dec. 2019 and 26th Feb. 2020 were collected and analyzed for Hubei and non-Hubei regions. Observed trends for new and cumulative cases were analyzed through joint-point regressions. Spatial analysis was applied to show the geographic distribution and changing pattern of the epidemic.\nResults\nBy 26th Feb. 2020, 78,630 confirmed COVID-19 cases had been reported in China. In Hubei, an increasing trend (slope=221) was observed for new cases between 24th Jan. and February 7th Feb. 2020, after which a decline commenced (slope=-868). However, as the diagnosis criteria changed, a sudden increase (slope=5530) was observed on 12th Feb., which sharply decreased afterward (slope=-4898). In non-Hubei regions, the number of new cases increased from 20th Jan. to 3rd Feb. and started to decline afterward (slope=-53). The spatial analysis identified Chongqing, Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Changsha, Nanchang, Wenzhou, Shanghai, Xinyang, Jining, and Beijing as the hotspots outside of Hubei province in China.\nConclusion and relevance\nThe joint-point regression analysis indicated that the epidemic might have been under control in China, especially for regions outside of Hubei province. Further improvement in the response strategies based on these new patterns is needed.\nCOVID-19, Geospatial pattern, epidemiological pattern, hot-spot\nTopic: china epidemics sars-cov-2 covid-19\nIssue Section: Major Article\nPDF\nThis content is only available as a PDF.\nAuthor notes\n\" These authors contributed equally.\n\u00a9 The Author(s) 2020.

The few trials which allow their inclusion focus on post-exposure prophylaxis or outpatient treatment of milder disease, limiting the options available to pregnant women with severe COVID-19 to compassionate use of remdesivir, or off-label drug use of hydroxychloroquine or other therapies. These restrictions were put in place despite experience with these drugs in pregnant women. In this Viewpoint, we call attention to the need and urgency to engage pregnant women in COVID-19 treatment trials now in order to develop data-driven recommendations regarding the risks and benefits of therapies in this unique but not uncommon population.\npregnancy, COVID-19, treatment, trial\nTopic: pregnancy breast feeding covid-19\nIssue Section: Viewpoints\nPDF\nThis content is only available as a PDF.\n\u00a9 The Author(s) 2020.

We conducted an investigation to identify secondary cases and interrupt transmission.\nMethods\nWe defined as a confirmed case a person linked to the chalet with a positive RT-PCR sample for SARS-CoV-2.\nResults\nThe index case stayed 4 days in the chalet with 10 English tourists and a family of 5 French residents; SARS-CoV-2 was detected in 5 individuals in France, 6 in England (including the index case), and 1 in Spain (overall attack rate in the chalet: 75%). One pediatric case, with picornavirus and influenza A coinfection, visited 3 different schools while symptomatic. One case was asymptomatic, with similar viral load as that of a symptomatic case. Seven days after the first cases were diagnosed, one tertiary case was detected in a symptomatic patient with a positive endotracheal aspirate; all previous and concurrent nasopharyngeal specimens were negative. Additionally, 172 contacts were monitored, including 73 tested negative for SARS-CoV-2.\nConclusions\nThe occurrence in this cluster of one asymptomatic case with similar viral load as a symptomatic patient, suggests transmission potential of asymptomatic individuals. The fact that an infected child did not transmit the disease despite close interactions within schools suggests potential different transmission dynamics in children. Finally, the dissociation between upper and lower respiratory tract results underscores the need for close monitoring of the clinical evolution of suspect Covid-19 cases.\ncoronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, Covid-19, cluster, infection\nTopic: coronavirus child internship and residency pediatrics picornaviridae respiratory system reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction singapore spain viral load result infections endotracheal aspiration influenzavirus a nasopharynx attack rate coinfection autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome dissociation medical residencies sars-cov-2 covid-19\nIssue Section: Major Article\nPDF\nThis content is only available as a PDF.\nAuthor notes\n\" equal contributions\n\u00a9 The Author(s) 2020.

The sensitivity was 97.1% by testing against 69 samples from hospitalized and/or recovered COVID-19 patients. The overall accuracy rate reached 97.3%. The assay was able to detect SARS-CoV-2 antibody on day one after the onset of COVID-19 disease.

Data are limited on the duration and host factors related to viral shedding.\nMethods\nIn this retrospective study, risk factors associated with severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA shedding were evaluated in a cohort of 113 symptomatic patients from two hospitals outside Wuhan.\nResults\nThe median duration of SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection was 17 days (Interquartile Range [IQR], 13\u201322 days) as measured from illness onset. When comparing patients with early (<15 days) and late viral RNA clearance (\u226515 days after illness onset), prolonged SARS-CoV-2 RNA shedding was associated with male sex (p=0.009), old age (p=0.033), concomitated with hypertension (p=0.009), delayed admission to hospital after illness onset (p=0.001), severe illness at admission (p=0.049), invasive mechanical ventilation (p=0.006), and corticosteroid treatment (p=0.025). Patients with longer SARS-CoV-2 RNA shedding duration had slower recovery of body temperature (p<0.001) and focal absorption on radiograph images (p<0.001) than patients with early SARS-CoV-2 RNA clearance. Male sex (odds ratio [OR], 3.24 [95% CI, 1.31\u20138.02]), delayed hospital admission (OR, 1.30 [95% CI, 1.10\u20131.54]), and invasive mechanical ventilation (OR, 9.88 [95% CI, 1.11\u201388.02]) were independent risk factors for prolonged SARS-CoV-2 RNA shedding.\nConclusions\nMale sex, delayed admission to hospital after illness onset, and invasive mechanical ventilation were associated with prolonged SARS-CoV-2 RNA shedding.

Mild illness has been reported, but whether illness severity correlates with infectivity is unknown. We describe the public health investigation of a mildly ill, non-hospitalized COVID-19 case who traveled to China.\nMethods\nThe case was a Maricopa County resident with multiple severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-positive specimens collected on January 22, 2020. Contacts were persons exposed to the case on or after the day before case diagnostic specimen collection. Contacts were monitored for 14 days after last known exposure. High-risk contacts had close, prolonged case contact (\u226510 minutes within 2 meters). Medium-risk contacts wore all U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)-recommended personal protective equipment during interactions. Nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal (NP/OP) specimens were collected from the case and high-risk contacts and tested for SARS-CoV-2.\nResults\nPaired case NP/OP specimens were collected for SARS-CoV-2 testing at 11 time points. In 8 pairs (73%), \u22651 specimen tested positive or indeterminate, and in 3 pairs (27%) both tested negative. Specimens collected 18 days after diagnosis tested positive. Sixteen contacts were identified; 11 (69%) had high-risk exposure, including 1 intimate contact, and 5 (31%) had medium-risk exposure. In total, 35 high-risk contact NP/OP specimens were collected for SARS-CoV-2 testing; all 35 pairs (100%) tested negative.\nConclusions\nThis report demonstrates that SARS-CoV-2 infection can cause mild illness and result in positive tests for up to 18 days after diagnosis, without evidence of transmission to close contacts. These data might inform public health strategies to manage individuals with asymptomatic infection or mild illness.\nCOVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, illness severity, viral transmission, serial testing\nTopic: centers for disease control and prevention (u.s.) infections arizona diagnosis public health medicine severity of illness transmission of virus sars-cov-2 covid-19\nIssue Section: Major Article\nPDF\nThis content is only available as a PDF.\nPublished by Oxford University Press for the Infectious Diseases Society of America 2020.

However, the infection condition of the genital system is unknown. Our aim in this study was to determine if SARS-CoV-2 is present in the vaginal fluid of women with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).\nMethods\nTen women with confirmed severe COVID-19 pneumonia admitted to the Tongji Zhongfa Hospital intensive care unit from 4 February 2020 through 24 February 2020 were included. Clinical records, laboratory results, and computed tomography examinations were retrospectively reviewed. The potential for genital infection was accessed by testing for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in vaginal fluids obtained from vaginal swab samples. Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction was used to confirm the SARS-CoV-2 infection in vaginal fluids.\nResults\nThe clinical characteristics of the 10 women were similar to those reported in other severe COVID-19 patients. All 10 patients were tested for SARS-CoV-2 in vaginal fluid, and all samples tested negative for the virus.\nConclusions\nFindings from this small group of cases suggest that SARS-CoV-2 virus does not exist in the vaginal fluids of severe COVID-19 patients.\nCOVID-19 pneumonia, SARS-CoV-2, vaginal fluid, clinical features\nTopic: body fluid pneumonia reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction infections vagina viruses sars-cov-2 covid-19\nIssue Section: Major Article\nIn December 2019, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the outbreak of a viral pneumonia caused by 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) as a global public health emergency, and it is now a pandemic [1, 2]. The disease was first reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, and has spread to more than 100 countries [3].\nAnother coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is spread mainly through respiratory droplets or direct contact. In previous studies, SARS-CoV-2 was found in the testis of male patients [4], but not in ovaries or the uterus [5]. In contrast, Ebola has been found in the vaginal fluid of female patients [6\u20138]. The infection condition of SARS-CoV-2 in the genital system is currently unknown. Our aim in this study was to determine if women with severe COVID-19 illness have signs of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in their vaginal fluid.\nMETHODS\nStudy Oversight\nAll eligible patients were invited to participate in the study. Those who agreed to participate provided written informed consent. The Peking Union Medical College Hospital Research Ethical Committee provided ethical approval for the study.\nData Sources and Collection\nAll medical records and data for hospitalized patients were obtained from 4 February 2020 through 24 February 2020 at the Tongji Zhongfa Hospital intensive care unit (ICU), which is managed by the Peking Union Medical College Hospital. The 10 participants were postmenopausal and were diagnosed with severe COVID-19 pneumonia. Clinical laboratory examinations, including blood analyses, serum biochemical tests, coagulation function tests, and chest computed tomography examinations, were performed. Vaginal swabs were obtained between 17 and 40 days after the onset of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Swabs were inserted 2\u20133 cm into the vagina and rotated for 3\u20135 seconds. Swabs were transferred to the laboratory immediately, and reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) procedures were completed within 2 hours. Clinical findings, laboratory and radiological findings, therapeutic interventions, and outcomes were collected for the 10 patients. All data were checked by 3 researchers.\nLaboratory Confirmation\nCOVID-19 was diagnosed on the basis of WHO interim guidance [9]. A confirmed case of COVID-19 was defined as a positive result on RT-PCR assay of nasal and/or pharyngeal swab specimens [2]. RT-PCR assays were performed in accordance with the protocol established by the WHO [10].\nRESULTS\nBetween 4 February 2020 and 24 February 2020, 10 postmenopausal women were admitted with confirmed severe COVID-2 pneumonia to the Tongji Zhongfa Hospital ICU. All of them were residents of Wuhan. The patients, aged 52 to 80 years, were initially admitted due to symptoms of fever or cough. They were transferred to the ICU because of severe illness; all met criteria for severe pneumonia based on the definition of illness severity in the WHO\u2019s interim guideline for COVID-19 [11] (Table 1). All patients had lymphopenia and eosinopenia, with evidence of liver and/or kidney dysfunction. All laboratory test results from the time of disease onset to the time of vaginal sampling are presented in Table 2.The presence of SARS-CoV-2 in vaginal fluid was determined. None were found to be positive for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR assay.\nTable 1.\nClinical Features and Computed Tomography Findings of Postmenopausal Women With Severe Coronavirus Disease 2019\nClinical Features Patient 1 Patient 2 Patient 3 Patient 4 Patient 5 Patient 6 Patient 7 Patient 8 Patient 9 Patient 10\nAge, y  57  65  52  80  71  63  73  66  55  75 \nEpidemic exposure  Lived in Wuhan  Lived in Wuhan  Lived in Wuhan  Lived in Wuhan  Lived in Wuhan  Lived in Wuhan  Lived in Wuhan  Lived in Wuhan  Lived in Wuhan  Lived in Wuhan \nMenopause  Yes  Yes  Yes  Yes  Yes  Yes  Yes  Yes  Yes  Yes \nChronic illness  No  Hypertension, diabetes type II  Hypertension  No  Hypothyroidism  No  Diabetes type II, hypothyroidism  No  Obesity  Coronary heart disease, hypertension, diabetes type II,  \nSeverity of pneumonia  Severe  Severe  Severe  Severe  Severe  Severe  Severe  Severe  Severe  Severe \nInitial symptoms  Fever, cough   Fever, cough  Fever  Fever, cough  Fever, cough  Fever, cough  Fever, cough  Fever, cough  Fever, cough  Fever, cough \nLowest oxygen saturation, %  65  70  94  84  94  92  91  93  80  99 \nDiagnosis method  RT-PCR  RT-PCR  RT-PCR  RT-PCR  RT-PCR  RT-PCR  RT-PCR  RT-PCR  RT-PCR  RT-PCR \nDays from diagnosis to sampling  25  26  31  40  27  24  17  28  33  30 \nAntiviral therapy  Yes  Yes  Yes  Yes  Yes  Yes  Yes  Yes  Yes  Yes \nChest computed tomography scan  Multiple bilateral ground-glass opacities and consolidation   Bilateral ground-glass opacities  Bilateral ground-glass opacities prominent on the left  Bilateral ground-glass opacities  Bilateral ground-glass opacities and consolidation  Bilateral ground- glass opacities prominent on the right  Regional ground-glass opacity in segments  Bilateral ground-glass opacities  Bilateral ground-glass opacities  Bilateral ground-glass opacities prominent on the left \nAbbreviations: PCR, polymerase chain reaction;

SARS-CoV-2 is spread mainly through respiratory droplets or close contact. There are few studies on the presence of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in body fluids [3, 12], and there are no reports of the presence of the virus in vaginal fluids. In our study, 10 postmenopausal women in the ICU with severe COVID-19 were tested for SARS-CoV-2 in vaginal fluid with RT-PCR assay, and all samples were negative for the virus.\nIn premenopausal women, the beneficial commensal lactobacilli present in the vagina can produce lactic acid to maintain low vaginal pH, which can inhibit colonization of pathogenic bacteria. These protective barriers against pathogens in postmenopausal women become weaker, leading to increased susceptibility to bacteria and viruses in postmenopausal women [13].\nPrevious studies have explored the effects of other epidemic viral infections on the female reproductive tract. Prisant et al confirmed the presence of Zika virus in the female reproductive tract [14]. Rodriguez et al [15] found Ebola virus in the vaginal fluid of a patient recovering from Ebola virus infection 33 days after the onset of illness.\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) caused by SARS-CoV was first discovered in November 2003 in Guangdong, China. The lungs sustain the most severe damage in patients with SARS. As the disease progresses, patients show multiple organ invasion. In one study, autopsy results of patients who died of SARS showed that SARS-CoV was present in the lungs, trachea/bronchus, stomach, small intestine, and distal renal tubules [8]. In another study, autopsy results showed the impact of the virus on the reproductive systems in both men and women. Xu et al [4] observed that orchitis was present in some men with SARS. The pathology of male SARS patients showed widespread germ cell destruction, almost no spermatozoon in seminiferous tubules, and leukocyte infiltration. However, the virus was not clearly detected in the testis [5, 16]. No studies have clearly shown that SARS-CoV invades the female reproductive tract, and there is no report of SARS-CoV being detected in vaginal fluids. The autopsy pathological results of SARS patients have not shown the virus in the ovaries and uterus, and one report did not assay vaginal fluids [5].\nSARS-CoV-2 may have transmission mechanisms that are similar to those of SARS-CoV. Limited research results indicate the presence of the virus in the stools of patients with COVID-193 as the disease progresses, which also suggests another possible route of transmission for the virus. At present, there is no report of SARS-CoV-2 being present in the female reproductive tract. This is particularly important because it could help inform the risks of sexual transmission and mother-to-child transmission. In our study, we included 10 female patients with COVID-19. Unlike Ebola virus or Zika virus, SARS-CoV-2 was not found in the vaginal fluids of women with severe pneumonia.\nWe are the first to attempt to detect SARS-CoV-2 in the vaginal fluid of patients with COVID-19. All the tested women were postmenopausal. Even when the patient\u2019s respiratory symptoms were severe, the results of vaginal swabs were negative for the presence of SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, it is possible that SARS-Cov-2 does not enter the vaginal fluid. This finding suggests that the likelihood of transmitting SARS-Cov-2 to sexual partners through vaginal fluids may be low.\nA single publication indicates that no SARS-CoV-2 was found in amniotic fluid or umbilical cord blood of women with COVID-19 [17]. In the same study, neonatal throat swabs were also negative. Taken together, these findings suggest that the risk of vertical transmission from pregnant women to newborns delivered by cesarean section is low. We did not find SARS-CoV-2 by PCR in vaginal fluids as late as 40 days after disease onset in women who still required ICU care for ongoing COVID-19 illness. Therefore, it is speculated that the risk of vertical transmission during vaginal delivery might also be very low.\nThe study has several limitations. First, the number of patients was small. In addition, only RT-PCR was used for detection of SARS-CoV-2. In theory, even if there is only 1 copy of the virus in the sample to be tested, it is likely to be detected. However, in practice, if there is a small amount of the virus, the amplification result may not be ideal. In our research, we recruited only postmenopausal women, and the vaginal swabs were taken 17 days or more after disease onset. More research on possible differences in the pathophysiology of SARS-CoV-2 in the female genital tract of premenopausal women is needed.\nNotes\nAuthor contributions. L. Z., T.

Currently, in Germany over 140,000 cases of COVID-19 are confirmed. Here we report a nosocomial outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 infections in the pediatric dialysis unit of the University Hospital of M\u00fcnster (UHM).\nMethods\nSingle-step real-time RT-PCR from nasopharyngeal swaps was used to diagnose the index patient and identify infected contacts. Epidemiological links were analyzed by patient interviews and chart reviews. In addition, each contact was assessed for exposure to the index case and monitored for clinical symptoms. Threshold cycle (Ct) values of all positive test results were compared between symptomatic and asymptomatic cases.\nResults\nForty-eight cases were involved in this nosocomial outbreak. Nine contact cases developed laboratory confirmed COVID-19 infections. Two SARS-CoV-2 positive cases remained clinically asymptomatic. Eleven cases reported flu-like symptoms without positive results. Ct values were significantly lower in cases presenting typical COVID-19 symptoms, suggesting high viral shedding (p =0.007).\nConclusion\nPerson-to-person transmission was at the heart of a hospital outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 between healthcare workers (HCWs) and patients in the pediatric dialysis unit at the UHM. Semi quantitative real-time RT-PCR results suggest that individuals with high viral load pose a risk to spread SARS-CoV-2 in the hospital setting. Our epidemiological observation highlights the need to develop strategies to trace and monitor SARS-CoV-2 infected HCWs in order to prevent COVID-19 outbreaks in the hospital setting.\nnosocomial SARS-CoV-2 outbreak, COVID-19, super-spreader, exposure-based risk classification, infection control measures\nTopic: hemodialysis disease outbreaks pediatrics dialysis procedure sars-cov-2 covid-19\nIssue Section: Major Article\nPDF\nThis content is only available as a PDF.\nAuthor notes\n\" equally contributing first authors\n\" equally contributing senior authors\n\u00a9 The Author(s) 2020.

Here, we investigated the clinical, cytokine levels, T cell proportion and related gene expression occurring in COVID-19 patients on admission and after intial treatment.\nMethods\n11 patients diagnosed as COVID-19 with similar initial treatment regimen were enrolled in the hospital. Plasma cytokines, CyTOF and microfluidic qPCR for gene expression were conducted.\nResults\n5 mild and 6 severe patients were included. Cough and fever were the top symptoms in the 11 COVID-2019 cases. The elder age, more neutrophils numbers and higher C-reactive protein level were found in severe cases. IL-10 level was significantly varied with disease progression and treatment. The decreased T cell proportions were observed in COVID-19 patients especially in severe cases, and all elevated to normal in mild patiens after initial treatment but only CD4+T cells return to normal in severe cases. The number of DEGs increased with the disease progress, and decreased after initial treatment. All down-regulated DEGs in severe cases mainly involved in Th17 cell differentiation, cytokine-mediated signaling pathway and T cell activation. After initial treatmen in severe cases, MAP2K7 and SOS1 were upregulated relative to that on admission.\nConclusions\nOur findings show a decreased T cell proportion with down-regulated gene expression related to T cell activation and differentiation were occurred in COVID-19 severe patients, which may help to provide effective treatment strategies for COVID-19 .\nCOVID-2019, PBMC, Immune response, Cytokine, Gene expression\nTopic: cytokine gene expression immune response cough fever disease progression interleukin-10 neutrophils plasma t-lymphocytes world health organization c-reactive protein measurement signal pathway t-cell activation signal transduction pathways cytokine gene pandemics sos1 gene peripheral blood mononuclear cell th17 cells treatment effectiveness sars-cov-2 covid-19\nIssue Section: Major Article\nPDF\nThis content is only available as a PDF.\nAuthor notes\n\" These authors contributed equally to this work.\n\u00a9 The Author(s) 2020.

Patients who deteriorated to severe or critical COVID-19 and patients who kept non-severe state were assigned to the severe and non-severe group, respectively. Based on baseline data of the two groups, we constructed a risk prediction nomogram for severe COVID-19 and evaluated its performance.\nResults\nThe training cohort consisted of 189 patients, while the two independent validation cohorts consisted of 165 and 18 patients. Among all cases, 72 (19.35%) patients developed severe COVID-19. We found that old age, and higher serum lactate dehydrogenase, C-reactive protein, the coefficient of variation of red blood cell distribution width, blood urea nitrogen, direct bilirubin, lower albumin, are associated with severe COVID-19. We generated the nomogram for early identifying severe COVID-19 in the training cohort (AUC 0.912 [95% CI 0.846-0.978], sensitivity 85.71%, specificity 87.58%); in validation cohort (0.853 [0.790-0.916], 77.5%, 78.4%). The calibration curve for probability of severe COVID-19 showed optimal agreement between prediction by nomogram and actual observation. Decision curve and clinical impact curve analysis indicated that nomogram conferred high clinical net benefit.\nConclusion\nOur nomogram could help clinicians to early identify patients who will exacerbate to severe COVID-19, which will enable better centralized management and early treatment of severe patients.\nCOVID-19, Nomogram, Severe COVID-19 prediction, Risk stratification\nTopic: coronavirus china nomogram stratification covid-19\nIssue Section: Major Article\nPDF\nThis content is only available as a PDF.\nAuthor notes\n\" These authors contributed equally to this work.\n\u00a9 The Author(s) 2020.

However, it is not clear whether testing for RNAaemia is correlated with the occurrence of cytokine storms or with the specific class of patients.\nMethods\nThis study enrolled 48 patients with COVID-19 admitted to the General Hospital of Central Theater Command, PLA, a designated hospital in Wuhan, China. The patients were divided into three groups according to the \u201cDiagnosis and Treatment of New Coronavirus Pneumonia (6th edition)\u201d issued by the National Health Commission of China. The clinical and laboratory data were collected. The serum viral load and IL-6 levels were determined. .\nResults\nClinical characteristics analysis of 48 cases of COVID-19 showed that RNAaemia was diagnosed only in the critically ill group and seemed to reflect the severity of the disease. Furthermore, the level of inflammatory cytokine IL-6 in critically ill patients increased significantly, almost 10 times that in other patients. More importantly, the extremely high IL-6 level was closely correlated with the detection of RNAaemia (R = 0.902).\nConclusions\nDetectable serum SARS-Cov-2 RNA(RNAaemia) in COVID-19 patients was associated with elevated IL-6 concentration and poor prognosis. Because the elevated IL-6 may be part of a larger cytokine storm which could worsen outcome, IL-6 could be a potential therapeutic target for critically ill patients with an excessive inflammatory response.\nCoronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19), RNAaemia, IL-6, critically ill patients, pneumonia, cytokine storm\nTopic: coronavirus critical illness pneumonia viral load result interleukin-6 cytokine storm sars-cov-2 covid-19\nIssue Section: Major Article\nPDF\nThis content is only available as a PDF.\nAuthor notes\n\" These authors contributed equally to this work.\n\u00a9 The Author(s) 2020.

Virus challenge, contact transmission, and passive immunoprophylaxis were performed. Serial organ tissues and blood were harvested for histopathology, viral load and titre, chemokine/cytokine assay, and neutralising antibody titre.\nResults\nThe Syrian hamster could be consistently infected by SARS-CoV-2. Maximal clinical signs of rapid breathing, weight loss, histopathological changes from the initial exudative phase of diffuse alveolar damage with extensive apoptosis to the later proliferative phase of tissue repair, airway and intestinal involvement with virus nucleocapsid protein expression, high lung viral load, and spleen and lymphoid atrophy associated with marked cytokine activation were observed within the first week of virus challenge. The lung virus titre was between 105-107 TCID50/g. Challenged index hamsters consistently infected na\u00efve contact hamsters housed within the same cage, resulting in similar pathology but not weight loss. All infected hamsters recovered and developed mean serum neutralising antibody titre \u22651:427 fourteen days post-challenge. Immunoprophylaxis with early convalescent serum achieved significant decrease in lung viral load but not in lung pathology. No consistent non-synonymous adaptive mutation of the spike was found in viruses isolated from infected hamsters.\nConclusions\nBesides satisfying the Koch\u2019s postulates, this readily available hamster model is an important tool for studying transmission, pathogenesis, treatment, and vaccination against SARS-CoV-2.\ncoronavirus, COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, animal, transmission\nTopic: apoptosis cytokine angiotensin-converting enzyme mutation lung weight reduction chemokines coronavirus atrophy cricetinae housing intestines mammals animal model nucleocapsid proteins vaccination viral load result wound healing mortality pathology spleen viruses tachypnea airway device airway structure diffuse alveolar damage neutralizing antibodies histopathology tests pulmonary pathology sars-cov-2 covid-19\nIssue Section: Major Article\nPDF\nThis content is only available as a PDF.\nAuthor notes\n\" J.F-W.C., A.J.Z., and S.Y. contributed equally to this work.\n\u00a9 The Author(s) 2020.

These disorders share underlying pathophysiology related to the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) that may be clinically insightful. In particular, activity of the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is dysregulated in cardiovascular disease, and this enzyme is used by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) to initiate the infection. Cardiovascular disease and pharmacologic RAS inhibition both increase ACE2 levels, which may increase the virulence of SARS-CoV-2 within the lung and heart. Conversely, mechanistic evidence from related coronaviruses suggests that SARS-CoV-2 infection may downregulate ACE2, leading to toxic overaccumulation of Angiotensin II that induces acute respiratory distress syndrome and fulminant myocarditis. RAS inhibition could mitigate this effect. With conflicting mechanistic evidence, we propose key clinical research priorities necessary to clarify the role of RAS inhibition in COVID-19 mortality that could be rapidly addressed by the international research community.\nCOVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2, Renin-Angiotensin System, Cardiovascular Disease\nTopic: cardiovascular diseases renin-angiotensin system angiotensin-converting enzyme infections mortality sars-cov-2 covid-19\nIssue Section: Viewpoints\nPDF\nThis content is only available as a PDF.\n\u00a9 The Author(s) 2020.

This study aimed to investigate the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of older patients with COVID-19 outside Wuhan.\nMethods\nA retrospective study was performed, with collecting data from medical records of confirmed COVID-19 patients in Zhejiang province from 17 January to 12 February 2020. Epidemiological, clinical, and treatment data were analyzed between older (\u2265\u200960 years) and younger (<\u200960 years) patients.\nResults\nA total of 788 patients with confirmed COVID-19 were selected; 136 were older patients with corresponding mean age of 68.28\u2005\u00b1\u20057.31 years. There was a significantly higher frequency of women in older patient group compared with younger patients (57.35% vs 46.47%, P\u2005=\u2005.021). The presence of coexisting medical conditions was significantly higher in older patients compared with younger patients (55.15% vs 21.93%, P\u2005<\u2005.001), including the rate of hypertension, diabetes, heart disease, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Significantly higher rates of severe clinical type (older vs younger groups: 16.18% vs 5.98%, P\u2005<\u2005.001), critical clinical type (8.82% vs 0.77%, P\u2005<\u2005.001), shortness of breath (12.50% vs 3.07%, P\u2005<\u2005.001), and temperature of >\u200939.0\u00b0C (13.97% vs 7.21%, P\u2005=\u2005.010) were observed in older patients compared with younger patients. Finally, higher rates of intensive care unit admission (9.56% vs 1.38%, P\u2005<\u2005.001) and methylprednisolone application (28.68% vs 9.36%, P\u2005<\u2005.001) were also identified in older patients compared with younger ones.\nConclusions\nThe specific epidemiological and clinical features of older COVID-19 patients included significantly higher female sex, body temperature, comorbidities, and rate of severe and critical type disease.\nCOVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, Epidemiology, elderly\nTopic: comorbidity signs and symptoms older adult covid-19\nIssue Section: Major Article\nCoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a novel identified infectious disease with rapid human-to-human transmission capacity and varied fatality, due to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), multiorgan failure, and other serious complications [1\u20133]. First reported in 1 December 2019 as \u201cpneumonia for unknown reason,\u201d the pathogen of COVID-19 was later identified by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) from the throat swab sample of a patient, and was subsequently named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) by the World Health Organization (WHO) [4]. Though huge efforts have been made by the Chinese government, including quarantining Wuhan city on 23 January 2020, its accelerated dissemination has appeared, infecting 68\u2009584 patients in China by 15 February 2020 and spreading worldwide. Currently, combating COVID-19 is the most important and first task for China, which also raises the global alert.\nCoronaviruses are named for the crown-like spikes on their surface, with known species of 229E, NL63, OC43, HKU1, SARS-CoV, and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV); the latter 2 are zoonotic in origin and have been linked to lethal diseases [5, 6]. SARS-CoV-2 was the seventh identified coronavirus with human infection capacity. A high mortality rate in older patients, especially those with comorbidities of hypertension, diabetes, and renal failure, had been reported both in SARS and MERS [7, 8]. Calculating from initial data of Wuhan, we found that the fatality rate for COVID-19 patients aged\u2005\u2265\u200560 years was 63.6% [1]. A previous study from SARS also suggested that older age was one of the strongest predictors of poor outcome [9]. Nevertheless, the specific features of older patients with COVID-19 outside Wuhan have not been reported as yet.\nBy 15 February 2020, Zhejiang Province had the fourth-largest number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in China (n = 1167). Compared with disease features in Wuhan, Zhejiang Province had a much lower number of severe/critical cases (76/1167 [6.5%]) and a higher rate of discharge from hospital (437/1167 [37.4%]), with no reported deaths. It is well acknowledged that older patients tend to have more serious diseases and complications; a previous study indicated a higher intensive care unit (ICU) admission rate in patients with median age >\u200966 years [10]. However, there are no reports specifically focusing on older patients with COVID-19. We aimed, in this study, to provide first-line information about the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of 136 older patients (\u2265 60 years of age) with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 in Zhejiang Province.\nMETHODS\nData Sources and Ethics\nWe retrospectively investigated the epidemiological, clinical, imaging, and laboratory characteristics of confirmed cases of COVID-19 with WHO interim guidance in Zhejiang Province from 17 January to 12 February 2020. All patients were diagnosed with COVID-19 by positive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) result. The data were uniformly collected by the Health Commission of Zhejiang Province, where all patients were allocated at specific hospitals for unified treatment according to the government emergency rule. The diagnosis was based on WHO interim guidance and all data were shared with WHO [4], with the primary analytic results reported to the authority of Zhejiang province. Since case collection and analysis were determined by the Health Commission of Zhejiang Province under national authorization and considered as part of the continuing public health outbreak investigation, our study was regarded exempt from institutional review board approval.\nDuring analysis, patients were divided into 2 groups according to age (\u2005\u2265\u200560 [older] vs <\u200560 years [younger]). The subtype definition of COVID-19 patients was based on the Chinese diagnosis and treatment scheme for COVID-19 (fifth edition), as previously reported [11]. The degree of COVID-19 was categorized as mild, severe, or critical. Mild type included nonpneumonia and mild pneumonia cases. Severe type was characterized by dyspnea, respiratory rate\u2005\u2265\u200530 breaths per minute, blood oxygen saturation\u2005\u2264\u200593%, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2)/fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) ratio\u2005<\u2005300, and/or lung infiltrates >\u200950% within 24\u201348 hours. Critical cases were those that exhibited respiratory failure, septic shock, and/or multiple organ dysfunction/failure.\nProcedures\nThe epidemiological, demographic, clinical, laboratory and management data from patients\u2019 medical records were retrieved and reviewed by 2 independent observers. The clinical outcomes were followed up to 12 February 2020. Missing or vague dates were confirmed by direct communication with healthcare providers. Laboratory confirmation of COVID-19 was done at the CDC of Zhejiang Province and local city level and the First Affiliated Hospital, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University, with national authorization. Throat swab specimens from the upper respiratory tract and sputum from all patients at admission were maintained in viral transport medium. COVID-19 was confirmed by real-time reverse-transcription PCR using the same protocol described previously [2]. Other common respiratory viruses including influenza A and B virus, respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza virus, adenovirus, SARS, and MERS were routinely precluded. All patients received chest radiographs or chest computed tomography (CT) at admission.\nOutcomes\nThe epidemiological data were collected, including exposure to Wuhan, contact with confirmed patients, and family clustering. The incubation period is calculated from the specific date of contact with a confirmed COVID-19 patient to the date of illness onset. Other important parameters were also summarized, including the anthropometric/ demographic data, symptoms and signs on admission, laboratory and chest radiograph/CT results, comorbidities, coinfection with other respiratory pathogens, treatment (including drugs, intensive care, and mechanical ventilation) and clinical outcomes.\nStatistical Analysis\nMean (standard deviation) and median (interquartile range [IQR]) were used for continuous variables with and without normal distribution whereas number (%) was used for categorical variables, followed by Mann-Whitney U and \u03c7\u200a2 test for comparison. For laboratory results, whether the measurements were outside the normal range was also analyzed. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate hospitalization time, and the log-rank test was applied for comparisons between the younger and older groups. The Kaplan-Meier analysis was conducted with the survfit function in the library of survival in R software (version 3.6.1). A 2-sided \u03b1 of < .05 was considered statistically significant and SPSS (version 26.0) was used for all analyses.\nRESULTS\nDemographic and Epidemiologic Characteristics\nThis study described 788 patients with confirmed COVID-19 from 17 January 2020 to 12 February 2020 in Zhejiang Province. As shown in Table 1, there were 136 and 652 patients in the older and younger groups, with corresponding mean age of 68.28\u2005\u00b1\u20057.31 years and 41.15\u2005\u00b1\u200511.38 years, respectively. There was no significant difference in the percentage of current smokers in the 2 groups. However, there was a significantly higher frequency of women among the older patients compared to the younger patients (57.35% vs 46.47%, respectively, P\u2005=\u2005.021), indicating the sex predisposition to female in older patients with COVID-19. The presence of any coexisting medical condition was significantly higher in older patients compared to younger patients (55.15% vs 21.93%, P\u2005<\u2005.001), including the rate of hypertension (38.97% vs 11.20%, P\u2005<\u2005.001), diabetes (17.65% vs 5.06%, P\u2005<\u2005.001), heart disease (4.41% vs 0.77%, P\u2005=\u2005.005), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (2.21% vs 0%, P\u2005=\u2005.005). Based on data from definite exposure date to epidemic area (Wuhan), we found that more patients had a history of traveling to Wuhan in the younger group compared to the older group (53.68% vs 31.62%, respectively, P\u2005<\u2005.001). More patients in the older group had a confirmed cluster history of contact with patients from the local area compared to patients in younger group (33.09% vs 23.01%, respectively, P\u2005<\u2005.001).\nTable 1.\nDemographic and Epidemiologic Features of Older Patients With Coronavirus Disease 2019\nCharacteristic Age\u2005<\u200560 y (n\u2005=\u2005652) Age\u2005\u2265\u200560 y (n\u2005=\u2005136) P Value\nAge, y, mean (SD)  41.15\u2005\u00b1\u200511.38  68.28\u2005\u00b1\u20057.31  <\u2009.001 \nFemale sex  303 (46.47)  78 (57.35)  .021 \nCurrent smoker  46 (7.06)  8 (5.88)  .622 \nCoexisting condition        \nAny  143 (21.93)  75 (55.15)  <\u2009.001 \nHypertension  73 (11.20)  53 (38.97)  <\u2009.001 \nDiabetes  33 (5.06)  24 (17.65)  <\u2009.001 \nChronic liver disease  25 (3.83)  6 (4.41)  .753 \nCancer  3 (0.46)  3 (2.21)  .067 \nChronic renal disease  5 (0.77)  2 (1.47)  .347 \nHeart disease  5 (0.77)  6 (4.41)  .005 \nCOPD  0 (0)  3 (2.21)  .005 \nImmunosuppression  0 (0)  1 (0.74)  .173 \nExposure history       \nFrom Wuhan  350 (53.68)  43 (31.62)  <\u2009.001 \nContact with patients  269 (41.26)  63 (46.32)  .276 \nCluster   150 (23.01)  45 (33.09)  .013 \nTime from onset of illness to consultation, d, median (IQR)  2 (1\u20134)  2 (1\u20134)  .867 \nTime from onset of illness to confirm the diagnosis, d, median (IQR)  4 (2\u20137)  4 (2\u20137)  .410 \nTime from onset of illness to hospitalization, d, median (IQR)  3 (1\u20137)  3 (1\u20136)  .945 \nClinical type on admission       \nSevere/critical  44 (6.75)  34 (25.0)  <\u2009.001 \nMild  608 (93.25)  102 (75.0)  <\u2009.001 \nSevere  39 (5.98)  22 (16.18)  <\u2009.001 \nCritical  5 (0.77)  12 (8.82)  <\u2009.001 \nData are presented as no.

In brief, fever and cough were the most common symptoms in both group. There were no significant differences in the percentages of fever, cough, sputum production, gastrointestinal symptoms, muscle ache, and headache in the 2 groups. However, older patients had significantly higher rate of shortness of breath (older vs younger groups: 12.50% vs 3.07%, P\u2005<\u2005.001) and lower rate of nasal obstruction (1.47% vs 6.90%, P\u2005=\u2005.015) compared with younger patients.

As show in Table 3, there were 117 patients (86.03%) in the older group and 551 (84.51%) patients in the younger group administrated with antiviral treatment, with a median period from onset of illness to antiviral therapy of 3 days and median antiviral duration of 11 days for both groups. In the younger and older groups, respectively, 192 and 43 patients received interferon-\u03b1 sprays, ritonavir-boosted lopinavir (LPV/r) (2 tablets [500 mg] twice daily), and arbidol hydrochloride capsules (2 tablets 3 times daily); 140 and 25 patients received interferon-\u03b1 sprays and LPV/r; 61 and 12 patients received LPV/r and arbidol; and 31 and 10 patients received interferon-\u03b1 sprays and arbidol. There were no differences regarding the antiviral regimen between the 2 groups. Glucocorticoid therapy was considered if PaO2/FiO2\u2005<\u2005300 mm Hg and is not recommended for patients with mild disease. The dose of glucocorticoid was 0.75\u20131.5 mg/kg/day and the median duration of corticosteroid therapy was 15 days. More patients in older than in the younger group (26.68% vs 9.36%, P\u2005<\u2005.001) received corticosteroid therapy.\nTable 3.\nTreatment and Outcomes in Older Patients With Coronavirus Disease 2019\nVariable Age\u2005<\u200560 y (n\u2005=\u2005652) Age\u2005\u2265 60 y\u2005 (n\u2005=\u2005136) P Value\nComplications       \nARDS  35 (5.37)  23 (16.91)  <\u2009.001 \nSeptic shock  1 (0.15)  1 (0.74)  .316 \nLiver function abnormality  72 (11.04)  10 (7.35)  .200 \nAcute kidney injury  10 (1.53)  3 (2.21)  .478 \nTreatment       \nAnti-coronavirus treatment  551 (84.51)  117 (86.03)  .793 \nTiming from onset of illness to antiviral therapy, median (IQR)  3 (1\u20136)  3 (1\u20136)  .653 \nAntiviral duration, median (IQR)  11 (7\u201316)  11 (6\u201317)  .877 \nAntivirus regimen  551 (84.51)  117 (86.03)  .793 \nInterferon-\u03b1\u2009+\u2009LPV/r \u2005+\u2005arbidol  192 (29.44)  43 (31.62)  .608 \nInterferon-\u03b1\u2009+\u2009LPV/r  140 (21.47)  25 (18.38)  .487 \nLPV/r +\u2005arbidol  61 (9.36)  12 (8.82)  1.000 \nInterferon-\u03b1\u2009+ arbidol  31 (4.75)  10 (7.35)  .207 \nOthersa  127 (19.48)  27 (19.85)  .906 \nMechanical ventilation  9 (1.38)  9 (6.62)  .001 \nNoninvasive  4 (0.61)  3 (2.21)  .103 \nInvasive  5 (0.77)  6 (4.41)  .005 \nCRRT  0  0   \nECMO  0  0   \nGlucocorticoids  61 (9.36)  39 (28.68)  <\u2009.001 \nMaximum dosageb, median (IQR)  40 (40\u201380)  40 (40\u201380)  .663 \nIVIG therapy  38 (5.83)  24 (17.65)  <\u2009.001 \nAdmission to intensive care unit  9 (1.38)  13 (9.56)  <\u2009.001 \nClinical outcomes       \nDischarged from hospital  291 (44.60)  31 (22.80)  <\u2009.001 \nData are presented as no.

The 788 patients were divided into 2 groups according to exposure history to Wuhan; there were 393 and 395 patients with and without Wuhan exposure history in the last month, respectively. We found that there was no significant difference in the rate of severe and critical type (with vs without Wuhan exposure, 7.89% vs 7.59%, P\u2005=\u2005.895; 2.04 vs 2.28%, P\u2005=\u20051.000) between the 2 groups.\nOxygen therapy plays an important role in supportive care of patients. In this study, 6.62% patients in the older group received mechanical ventilation, significantly higher than that of 1.38% in the younger group (P\u2005=\u2005.001). The ventilator adopted pressure-synchronized intermittent mandatory ventilation mode, with inhaled oxygen concentration of 35%\u2013100% and positive end-expiratory pressure of 6\u201312 cm H2O. Meanwhile, significantly more patients in the older group (9.56% vs 1.38%, P\u2005<\u2005.001) were admitted to ICU compared to the younger group by 12 February 2020. Till now, no patients received continuous blood purification due to renal failure and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. Liver injury was the most common complication, followed by ARDS and acute kidney injury. Significantly more patients in the older group developed ARDS than in the younger group (16.9% vs 5.37%, P\u2005<\u2005.001). By the end of 12 February, all patients survived, and significantly more patients in the younger group had been discharged than in the older group (44.6% vs 22.8%, P\u2005<\u2005.001; Figure 1).\nFigure 1.\nOpen in new tabDownload slide\nKaplan-Meier estimates of hospitalization time in younger (< 60 years) and older (\u2265 60 years) groups. Abbreviation: COVID-19, coronavirus disease 2019.\nDISCUSSION\nCOVID-19 is a novel identified human infectious disease, belonging to the family of coronavirus [12]. Starting from 788 confirmed cases from Zhejiang Province, we found that the age of patients spanned from an infant of 3 months to adults of 96 years, where 136 cases were > 60 years of age. Differing from young patients, 68.3% of older patients had no history of travel to Wuhan, and 86.3% of older patients were exposed to confirmed COVID-19 patients, with a median incubation period of 5 days (IQR, 2\u20139 days). More importantly, there were 49.5% of patients infected via family clustering and social activities, where 5 couples infected each other, 6 patients acquired infection after attending a ritual in their local temple, 5 patients acquired infection after a dinner party, and some were infected during square dancing. The other reason may rely on the inadequate recognition of COVID-19 by elders, with lower rates of mask wearing. The explanation for the phenomenon of a significantly higher ratio of female in the elderly group may rely on the finding that ACE2 expression of rat lung was significantly higher in females than in males [13].\nThis study confirmed that features of COVID-19 in older adults resembled other forms of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). Patients with COVID-19 from the older group had higher rates of common comorbidities, where hypertension, diabetes, chronic heart disease, and COPD reaching statistical significance. On admission, the rate of severe/critical type was significantly higher in the older group than in the younger group. Fever, cough, and dyspnea are the common symptoms of acute CAP and there was no significant difference in the rate of fever between the 2 groups. However, the ratio of >38\u00b0C was significantly higher in the older than in the younger group. It is well acknowledged that the degree of high fever is associated with inflammatory cytokine secretion and clinical symptoms.\nThere were no significant differences in cough, sputum production, hemoptysis, sore throat, nasal obstruction, muscle ache, fatigue, and gastrointestinal tract symptoms between the older and younger groups. In contrast, the rate of shortness of breath was significantly higher in the older group, which is in accordance with more severe lung CT findings of multiple mottling and ground-glass opacity and more ARDS in those patients. Heart injury was also more common in the older group, as reflected by significantly increased aspartate aminotransferase and lactate dehydrogenase levels. The rates of low albumin and hemoglobin levels were significantly higher in the older group, which may be related with poor nutrition and disease progression.\nCurrently, there was no effective antiviral therapy for COVID-19 [14]. We used interferon-\u03b1, LPV/r, and arbidol for virus inhibition according to previous clinical experience, but a unified treatment plan is still lacking. A retrospective study revealed that proper use of corticosteroids in confirmed critical SARS resulted in lower mortality and shorter hospitalization stay [15]. Another study also showed that low- to moderate-dose corticosteroids might reduce mortality of patients with influenza A (H1N1)pdm09 viral pneumonia with PaO2 /FiO2\u2005<\u2005300 mm Hg [16]. In this study, corticosteroid therapy was initiated if COVID-19 patients with PaO2/FiO2\u2005<\u2005300 mm Hg had quicker disease progression, higher temperature, and more lung inflammatory exudation; their glucocorticoid application rate (28.68%) was significantly higher than that in younger patients (9.36%). To avoid side effects of corticosteroid, its dosage was decreased to 40\u201380 mg/day. Until now, only 2 cases of gastrointestinal tract bleeding and 10 cases of hyperglycemia were identified in this study, with no secondary bacteria and fungal infection. Therefore, the application of antibiotics and antifungal drugs was also lower in Zhejiang Province than in Wuhan.\nPrevious study [9] showed that 21% of SARS patients were > 60 years of age and accounted for 68% of all deaths related to SARS. The 30- and 150-day mortality rates in SARS patients aged >\u200960 years were 56% and 60%, respectively. In this study, we found that 32% of confirmed COVID-19 patients were >\u200960 years of age who had 25% severe/critical type in admission. Those elderly patients with severe/critical type accounted for 43% of the total severe/critical type in our study. Compared with SARS, the mortality of COVID-19 was much lower. The number of COVID-19 patients in Zhejiang Province was also much lower than in Wuhan and the medical resources were more abundant, contributing to the earlier diagnosis, quarantine, and treatment of those patients. As of 12 February 2020, there were total 322 COVID-19 patients discharged from hospital and no deaths were reported. According to accumulated reports from Wuhan, the rate of severe/critical type and mortality were relatively high, reaching 15% in one study [2]. Another study revealed that the median age for ICU and non-ICU patients was 66 years and 51 years, respectively, with mortality of 4.3% [10]. We compared COVID-19 patients of Zhejiang Province with and without Wuhan exposure history and found no significant differences in clinical and virological features (unpublished preliminary data). Additionally, for COVID-19 patients of Zhejiang Province, the median time was 2 days (IQR, 1\u20134 days), 4 days (IQR, 2\u20137 days), and 3 days (IQR, 1\u20137 days) from illness onset to outpatient clinic visit, confirmed diagnosis, and isolation therapy, respectively. In Wuhan, the official estimated median time for illness onset to hospital admission was 9.84 days, which may be caused by the shortage of healthcare resources.\nOur study has several limitations. First, the retrospective design of this study may decrease its credibility and future perspective cohort studies should be considered. Second, the comprehensive analysis of older patients with COVID-19 on the national level is urgently needed, which will provide data that are more reliable. Third, although we summarized the application of antiviral therapy and glucocorticoid usage in the older patients with COVID-19, there is still a lack of randomized clinical trials to provide high-quality evidence. Finally, the data regarding the outcomes of older patients with COVID-19 need to be further investigated, for most older patients were still under treatment in hospital.\nIn summary, we reported the specific epidemiological and clinical features of older patients with COVID-19, including significantly higher female sex, body temperature, familial clustering, common comorbidities, and rate of severe/critical type.\nNotes\nAuthor contributions.

There were 9 family members, including 8 laboratory-confirmed with COVID-19, and a 6-year-old child had no evidence of infection. Among the 8 patients, 1 adult and a 13-month-old infant were asymptomatic, and 1 adult was diagnosed as having severe pneumonia.\nCOVID-19, family cluster, presymptomatic carriers\nTopic: china covid-19\nIssue Section: Brief Report\nSince the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was identified in early December 2019, the number of cases has been rapidly increasing [1]. Chan and colleagues reported SARS-CoV-2 in a family setting with person-to-person transmission [2]. We are here reporting a family cluster of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) transmission and clinical features in Zhejiang, China, after a visit to a temple.\nOn 19 January, a couple participated in a temple activity to celebrate the Chinese Spring Festival. The 58-year-old woman (index 1) fell ill with fever, fatigue, and headache on 24 January. However, the 60-year-old man (index 2) was without any symptoms.\nIn between the temple visit and the onset of symptoms, the couple\u2019s daughter, son-in-law, and 2 grandchildren (cases 1\u20134) had visited and stayed with them from 20 to 23 January. Index 1 went to hospital on 26 January, and was diagnosed with COVID-19 on 29 January by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR).\nIndex 2 and cases 1\u20134 were all admitted to hospital as persons under investigation on the day index 1\u2019s diagnosis was confirmed. The daughter (case 1) presented with fever and cough on 27 January, and was diagnosed with COVID-19 after being tested positive by RT-PCR using throat swab specimen.\nOn 1 February, index 2 tested positive via throat swab RT-PCR but stayed asymptomatic. Case 1\u2019s husband (case 2) started to suffer fever and was laboratory-diagnosed on the same day. The 6-year-old daughter (case 3) showed no symptoms and tested negative 3 times for throat swab and negative once for rectal swab by RT-PCR, and remained clear in chest computed tomographic scans. She was the only family member who was uninfected by SARS-CoV-2. The 13-month-old daughter (case 4) was asymptomatic but was laboratory-confirmed on 5 February.\nOn 23 January 23, before index 1 showed any symptoms, cases 1\u20134 had dinner with case 2\u2019s mother (case 5), father (case 6), and grandmother (case 7). They were admitted to hospital as persons under observation on 1 February, and were laboratory-confirmed to have contracted COVID-19 on 2, 5, and 6 February, respectively. Case 6 was a 57-year-old man who was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) as the symptoms got worse and the level lactic acid continued to increase (Figure 1).\nFigure 1.\nOpen in new tabDownload slide\nTimeline of exposure to index patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in China. Abbreviations: F, female; ICU, intensive care unit; M, male; PCR, polymerase chain reaction.\nThis series of laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19 was diagnosed in the Zhejiang province, which lies outside Wuhan. First, although the family members were from 3 households, they all were infected directly or indirectly from the same 2 index patients. The clinical features were diverse across patients; in particular, there were 2 asymptomatic patients and 1 patient whose symptoms were so severe that he had to be transferred to ICU. Second, this cluster demonstrated that COVID-19 is transmittable during the incubation period, as the daughter and her family caught the disease during the incubation period of index 1 and index 2. Third, patients can stay asymptomatic, such as index 2 and case 4 in this cluster. Given that Zou et al [3] found that the viral load of symptomatic and asymptomatic patients were similar, asymptomatic patients can still infect others. These \u201csilent patients\u201d may remain undiagnosed and be able to spread the disease to large numbers of people. Last, it appears that children may not be as susceptible to this new virus as adults and elderly persons, and they may fare better when they have contracted the virus. As reported in this family cluster, the 6-year-old child was not infected and the 13-month-old was infected but stayed asymptomatic.\nIn summary, there are variations across individuals in the clinical manifestations of COVID-19, indicating that we should pay attention to how to prevent people from being infected by asymptomatic patients and patients who are in the incubation period.\nNotes\nAuthor contributions.

Although SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV share a number of common clinical manifestations, SARS-CoV-2 appears to be highly efficient in person-to-person transmission and frequently cause asymptomatic infections. However, the underlying mechanism that confers these viral characteristics on high transmissibility and asymptomatic infection remain incompletely understood.\nMethods\nWe comprehensively investigated the replication, cell tropism, and immune activation profile of SARS-CoV-2 infection in human lung tissues with SARS-CoV included as a comparison.\nResults\nSARS-CoV-2 infected and replicated in human lung tissues more efficiently than that of SARS-CoV. Within the 48-hour interval, SARS-CoV-2 generated 3.20 folds more infectious virus particles than that of SARS-CoV from the infected lung tissues (P<0.024). SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV were similar in cell tropism, with both targeting types I and II pneumocytes, and alveolar macrophages. Importantly, despite the more efficient virus replication, SARS-CoV-2 did not significantly induce types I, II, or III interferons in the infected human lung tissues. In addition, while SARS-CoV infection upregulated the expression of 11 out of 13 (84.62%) representative pro-inflammatory cytokines/chemokines, SARS-CoV-2 infection only upregulated 5 of these 13 (38.46%) key inflammatory mediators despite replicating more efficiently.\nConclusions\nOur study provided the first quantitative data on the comparative replication capacity and immune activation profile of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV infection in human lung tissues. Our results provided important insights on the pathogenesis, high transmissibility, and asymptomatic infection of SARS-CoV-2.\ncoronavirus, COVID-19, ex vivo, interferon, SARS-CoV-2\nTopic: lung coronavirus interferons infections sars coronavirus lung parenchyma sars-cov-2 covid-19\nIssue Section: Major Article\nPDF\nThis content is only available as a PDF.\nAuthor notes\n\" Co-first authors\n\u00a9 The Author(s) 2020.

The current method of detection involves a quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR)\u2013based technique, which identifies the viral nucleic acids when present in sufficient quantity. False-negative results can be achieved and failure to quarantine the infected patient would be a major setback in containing the viral transmission. We aim to describe the time kinetics of various antibodies produced against the 2019 novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) and evaluate the potential of antibody testing to diagnose COVID-19.\nMethods\nThe host humoral response against SARS-CoV-2, including IgA, IgM, and IgG response, was examined by using an ELISA-based assay on the recombinant viral nucleocapsid protein. 208 plasma samples were collected from 82 confirmed and 58 probable cases (qPCR negative but with typical manifestation). The diagnostic value of IgM was evaluated in this cohort.\nResults\nThe median duration of IgM and IgA antibody detection was 5 (IQR, 3\u20136) days, while IgG was detected 14 (IQR, 10\u201318) days after symptom onset, with a positive rate of 85.4%, 92.7%, and 77.9%, respectively. In confirmed and probable cases, the positive rates of IgM antibodies were 75.6% and 93.1%, respectively. The detection efficiency by IgM ELISA is higher than that of qPCR after 5.5 days of symptom onset. The positive detection rate is significantly increased (98.6%) when combining IgM ELISA assay with PCR for each patient compared with a single qPCR test (51.9%).\nConclusions\nThe humoral response to SARS-CoV-2 can aid in the diagnosis of COVID-19, including subclinical cases.\nnovel coronavirus, COVID-19, antibody, ELISA, diagnosis\nTopic: enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay plasma immunoglobulin m antibodies diagnosis immunity, humoral sars-cov-2 covid-19\nIssue Section: Major Article\nA novel coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causing coronavirus disease in 2019 (COVID-19) emerged as a major pandemic [1, 2]. With more than 110\u2005000 confirmed cases and over 4000 deaths as of 11 March 2020, this pandemic surpassed the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) of 2003 [3].\nCoronaviruses are frequent causes of respiratory infections in which 6 major species are known to cause human infections besides the SARS-CoV-2. These species include the highly pathogenic SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), along with less virulent species that include NL63, 229E, OC43, and HKU1 [4]. The epidemiology, etiology, and clinical characteristics of COVID-19 have recently been described in detail [5\u201311]. The current methods of diagnosis of COVID-19 includes detection of the virus by genomic techniques using either polymerase chain reaction (PCR)\u2013based methods or deep sequencing [7, 12, 13]. However, these detection methods heavily rely on the presence of the viral genome in sufficient amounts at the site of sample collection that can be amplified. Missing the time window of viral replication can provide false-negative results. Similarly, an incorrect sample collection can limit the usefulness of the quantitative PCR (qPCR)\u2013based assay. A false-negative diagnosis can have grave consequences, especially at this stage of the pandemic, by allowing infected patients to spread the infection and hampering the efforts to contain the spread of the virus [14]. In such conditions, additional screening methods that can detect the presence of infection despite lower viral titers can be highly beneficial to ensure timely diagnosis of all infected patients. Detection of the production of antibodies, especially immunoglobulin (Ig) M, which are produced rapidly after the infection, can be a tool that can be combined with PCR to enhance detection sensitivity and accuracy.\nHowever, currently, the extent and the time kinetics of the humoral response against SARS-CoV-2 are not known. In this study, we demonstrate the time kinetics of the antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 in infected patients. We further demonstrate that combining the antibody testing with qPCR can significantly improve the diagnosis of COVID-19.\nMETHODS\nExpression and Purification of SARS-CoV-2 Nucleocapsid Proteins\nThe full-length nucleocapsid (N) genes of SARS-CoV-2 were amplified from a bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) specimen of a patient infected with SARS-CoV-2 and cloned into prokaryotic expression vector pET30a (+) (Novagen, San Diego, CA, USA). The resultant plasmids were transformed into Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) to express the recombinant N proteins (rNPs) according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. The 6X\u2005histidine-tagged proteins were then purified by using HiTrap SP FF and HisTrap HP columns (GE Healthcare, Waukesha, WI, USA) to\u2005greater than\u200590% purity. The identity of the purified protein was confirmed by Western blot analysis using an anti-6X\u2005histidine monoclonal antibody (Sigma, St Louis, MO, USA). The rNPs of human CoV-229E, -NL63, -OC43, -HKU1, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV were expressed and purified as described previously [15].\nPatients and Plasma Specimens\nIn this study, a total of 208 blood samples were collected from 2 cohorts. In the first cohort, we recruited a total of 101 inpatients from Wuhan hospitals during the early phase of the pandemic in January 2020. Paired throat swab and blood samples were taken from each patient. Among them, 43 (20 severe and 23 mild to moderate) were confirmed virus positive (referred as \u201cconfirmed cases\u201d [CCs]) by deep sequencing or a qPCR assay with a detection limit of 1 copy/\u03bcL, as previously reported [1, 2], while 58 cases (5 severe and 53 mild to moderate) suspected to be infected with SARS-CoV-2 based on clinical manifestation, chest radiography imaging, and epidemiology but no virus were detected by deep sequencing or a qPCR assay (referred as \u201cprobable cases\u201d [PCs]). A total of 69 blood samples were taken from the 43 CCs (2 serial samples from 26 patients with a 4-day interval and 1 sample from the remaining 17 patients), while 100 plasma samples were collected from 58 PCs (2 blood samples from 42 PCs and 1 single blood sample from 16 PCs). The second cohort included a total of 39 hospitalized CCs recruited from Beijing hospitals (8 severe and 31 mild to moderate cases), with 1 blood sample provided from each patient. All of the blood samples were taken between 1 and 39 days of the disease onset. In addition, a family cluster including 6 individuals over 3 generations was enrolled to validate our detection method.\nAnother 135 plasma samples collected in 2018 from adult patients with acute lower respiratory tract infections (ALRTIs) and 150 plasma samples obtained from healthy adults in 2018\u20132019 during regular health check-ups in Wuhan city were used as controls. The plasma samples positive for human CoV-229E, -NL63, -OC43, -HKU1, and SARS-CoV were obtained as previously reported [15].\nWestern Blot Analysis\nPurified rNPs of human CoV-229E, -NL63, -OC43, -HKU1, and SARS-CoV were separated by 12% sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) gels and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Pall, Port Washington, NY, USA). Human plasma samples positive for these coronaviruses were applied to detect cross-reactivity between these N proteins and antibodies. Goat antihuman IRDye Fluor 800-labeled IgG secondary antibody was used at a dilution of 10\u2005000 (Li-Cor, Lincoln, NE, USA). The membranes were scanned by using the Odyssey Infrared Imaging System (Li-Cor).\nEnzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay\nWe developed an indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) protocol for detecting IgM, IgA, and IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 using purified rNPs as coating antigens. The ELISA protocol was developed as previously reported [16]. The concentration of the coated rNPs and plasma dilutions for this ELISA were optimized using chessboard titration tests. To determine the cutoff values for the ELISAs, we determined the mean values and SDs of plasma from healthy individuals. The optimal coating concentration of antigen and optimal plasma dilutions were 0.1 \u03bcg/mL and 1:200, respectively. The cutoff values were determined by calculating the mean absorbance at 450 nm (A450) of the negative sera plus 3-fold the SD values, which were 0.13, 0.1, and 0.30 for IgM, IgA, and IgG, respectively.\nPhylogenetic Analysis\nThe viral nucleocapsid gene sequences were aligned using the ClustalW program using MEGA software (version 7.0.14). Phylogenetic trees were constructed by means of neighbor-joining methods with the use of MEGA software (version 7). The viral full-genome sequences were deposited in GISAISD (no. EPI_ISL_402123) and the Genome Warehouse in the National Genomics Data Center, Beijing Institute of Genomics (BIG), Chinese Academy of Sciences (accessible at https://bigd.big.ac.cn/gwh).\nEthics Approval\nThis study was approved by the Ethical Review Board of Institute of Pathogen Biology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College. Written informed consent was waived in the light of this emerging infectious disease of high clinical relevance. For healthy volunteers and patients suffering from common respiratory infections, written informed consent was obtained from each person before enrollment.\nStatistical Analysis\nPlasma antibody titers are expressed as geometric mean titers (GMTs) and compared using the Student\u2019s t test by using the SPSS software program version 19.0. We used a nonlinear regression (third-order polynomial) model to fit the positive rate of andibodies. P\u2005<\u2005.05 was considered to be statistically significant.\nRESULTS\nCross-reactivity Between SARS-CoV-2 and Other Human Coronaviruses\nTo evaluate the potential cross-reactivities of N proteins between SARS-CoV-2 and other human coronaviruses, we examined the reactivities of the SARS-CoV-2 rNP and human plasma with positive antibodies against NL63, 229E, OC43, HKU1, and SARS-CoV, respectively, by using Western blot and ELISA assays.\nWestern blot analysis showed that there was no cross-reactivity of SARS-CoV-2 rNP with human plasma positive for IgG antibodies against NL63, 229E, OC43, and HKU1. However, a strong cross-reactivity was observed between SARS-CoV\u2013positive human plasma and SARS-CoV-2 rNP, and specific bands of 45 kD in size were observed (Figure 1A). The cross-reactivities were also confirmed by using ELISAs where SARS-CoV\u2013positive human plasma presented high A450 with SARS-CoV-2 rNP (Figure 1B). These results indicate cross-reactivity of antibodies to N proteins between the SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. Pairwise analysis showed the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid gene had 46.1%, 27.6%, 26.5%, 20.0%, and 19.1%, amino acid (aa) sequence homology with MERS-CoV, HKU1, OC43, NL63, and 229E, respectively. Interestingly, 90.5% aa sequence homology was observed with SARS-CoV, which may explain the cross-reactivity between the 2 viruses (Figure 2).\nFigure 1.\nOpen in new tabDownload slide\nCross-reactivity between human plasma against NL63, 229E, OC43, and HKU1 with the N protein of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).

B, Amino acid sequence comparison of the nucleocapsid gene of SARS-CoV-2, IPBCAMS-WH-01/2019 (EPI_ISL_402123), compared with SARS-CoV (NC004718).\nCharacteristics of Plasma Antibodies in Patients Infected With SARS-CoV-2\nFirst, we examined the specificity of the ELISA by using 135 plasma samples from patients with ALRTIs and 150 healthy individuals whose samples were collected in 2018\u20132019 in Wuhan city. No anti\u2013SARS-CoV-2 IgM, IgA, and IgG antibodies were detected in these samples (data not shown). The antibody levels were then evaluated in the plasma samples of CCs and PCs.\nThe appearance of IgM, IgA, and IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 was positive as early as day 1 after the symptom onset (Figure 3A). Of the 208 samples tested, 41 were collected between 1 and 7 days, 84 samples between 8 and 14 days, and 83 samples were collected\u2005after\u200514 days post\u2013symptom onset (PSO). The total numbers of samples positive for IgM and IgA were 188 (90.4 %) and 194 (93.3 %) of 208 plasma samples, respectively. As IgM is a marker for acute infection, we specifically examined the positivity of anti\u2013SARS-CoV-2 IgM in the 41 plasma samples that were collected within 7 days PSO, which may represent acute-phase samples. Of these samples, anti\u2013SARS-CoV-2 IgM was detected in 35 samples (85.4%), 27 of which were detected at a plasma dilution of 1:400 and 8 samples were detected at 1:200 dilution. IgA antibodies were detected in 38 of these early samples (92.7%), with an antibody dilution of 1:400. Based on these acute-phase samples, the IgM and IgA antibodies were both detectable at day 5 (median; interquartile range [IQR], 3\u20136 days), respectively. The anti\u2013SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies were positive in 162 (77.9 %) plasma samples. The median time of appearance of IgG was at day 14 (IQR, 10\u201318 days) PSO (Figure 2A). The times of detection of IgM, IgA, and IgG against SARS-CoV-2 ranged from day 1 to 39 PSO in our study (data not shown).\nFigure 3.\nOpen in new tabDownload slide\nCharacteristics of plasma antibodies in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. A, Time of appearance of IgM, IgA, and IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2, determined by ELISA of plasma samples obtained from inpatients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. As we only wanted to show the early time points, the plasma samples used for detection of IgM and IgA antibodies were selected from patients who had fever or respiratory infectious symptoms within 7 days. The plasma samples used for detection of IgG antibodies were selected from all the patients whose IgG antibodies were positive. B, Levels of IgM, IgA, and IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in plasma samples after symptom onset. Antibody titers are expressed as GMTs. Abbreviations: ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; GMT, geometric mean titer; Ig, immunoglobulin. *P <.05.\nThe endpoint titration for antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 rNP was determined by calculating the A450 of a 2-fold serial dilution of each plasma sample for IgM, IgA, and IgG (Figure 3B). Compared with the titers at days 0\u20137 (GMT, 400), the IgM antibody levels increased between days 8 and 14 (GMT, 535.8; P\u2005=\u2005.000; Student\u2019s t test) but did not increase further between days 15 and 21 (GMT, 536.31; P\u2005=\u2005.992) or after day 21 (GMT, 565.69; P\u2005=\u2005.719). IgA antibody levels increased from days 0\u20137 (GMT, 400) to days 8\u201314 (GMT, 597.24; P\u2005=\u2005.000); however, there was no increase after this time point (GMT at day 15\u201321\u2005=\u2005723.28, P\u2005=\u2005.156; or GMT at day\u2005>21\u2005=\u2005831.41, P\u2005=\u2005.538). The IgG antibodies were detected on days 0\u20137 (GMT, 490.45), increased on days 8\u201314 (GMT, 1325.6; P\u2005=\u2005.000), continued to increase until days 15\u201321 (GMT, 2690.87; P\u2005=\u2005.000), and reached a plateau by day 21 (GMT, 2974.83; P\u2005=\u2005.72).\nIgM ELISA Assay Used for Early Diagnosis of Patients Infected With SARS-CoV-2\nThe IgM-positive rate to SARS-CoV-2 was 75.6% (62/82) in CCs and 93.1% (54/58) in PCs (Figure 4A). Further, we fitted curves of the PCR-positive rate and IgG and IgM ELISA positive rates on different days after symptom onset (Figure 4B). The detection rates between days 26 and 39 PSO are not shown due to the limited number of patients on each day. Based on the fitted curve, the PCR-positive rate was\u2005more than\u200590% on 1\u20133 days PSO, then declined to less than 80% (95% confidence interval [CI], 57.1\u201395.7%) at day 6 and less than 50% (95% CI, 23.7\u201359.5%) after 14 days PSO. Overall, the detection rate by qPCR was higher than the IgM ELISA before 5.5 days PSO, while the detection efficiency by IgM ELISA was higher than that of the PCR method after 5.5 days of symptom onset. Overall, the positive detection rate was only 51.9% in a single PCR test, but significantly increased (98.6%) when an IgM ELISA assay was applied to PCR-negative patients (Figure 4C). To further evaluate the performance of anti\u2013SARS-CoV-2 IgM in COVID-19 diagnosis, we analyzed the data from the 26 CCs who had 2 serial plasma samples together with paired throat swabs within a 4-day interval. Among them, 7 patients were PCR negative when testing the first swab, but 6 patients were IgM positive. All 7 patients were PCR positive for the second swab. These results suggest that IgM ELISA can increase the positive detection rate when combined with the PCR method and can be used for the early diagnosis of COVID-19 infections.\nFigure 4.\nOpen in new tabDownload slide\nIgM ELISA to diagnose patients infected with COVID-19.

The grandparents returned to Beijing from Wuhan on 22 January 2020. The grandmother started having symptoms including fever (38.0\u2103) and dry cough, and chest computed tomography (CT) showed a bilateral patchy shadow on 2 February. The grandfather experienced a stuffy and runny nose on 3 February. The other 4 members in the family had no significant clinical symptoms. The PCR assay and chest CT of their close contacts, including their daughter, son-in-law, grandson, and granddaughter, were performed on 5 February. The grandmother was found to be positive on viral RNA detection by qPCR. The grandfather and daughter only presented abnormal findings on chest CT but were negative for viral RNA when tested by PCR. The grandson presented with PCR positivity with a normal chest CT. The son-in-law and granddaughter were PCR negative and showed normal lungs by CT imaging. The grandfather, daughter, son-in-low, and granddaughter were also negative for SARS-CoV-2 after the repeat PCR on the next day. However, the IgM antibodies were detected in the grandmother, grandfather, daughter, grandson, and granddaughter. These findings indicate the significant and improved efficacy of COVID-19 detection when IgM measurements are used to assess subclinical subjects.\nTable 1.\nDiagnosis of a Family Cluster of Cases Using IgM ELISA\nRelationship Age, years PCR IgM Titers IgG Titers Computed Tomography Clinical Diagnosis\nGrandmother  61  +  400  \u2212  +  Case \nGrandfather  64  \u2212  800  3200  +  Case \nDaughter  37  \u2212  400  \u2212  +  Close contact \nSon-in-law  40  \u2212  \u2212  \u2212  \u2212  Close contact \nGrandson  6  +  200  \u2212  \u2212  Close contact \nGranddaughter  2  \u2212  400  \u2212  \u2212  Close contact \nAbbreviations: ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; IgM, immunoglobulin M; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; +, positive; \u2212, negative.\nOpen in new tab\nDiscussion\nCOVID-19 has emerged as a major healthcare challenge globally [13, 14, 16, 17]. A key aspect of limiting this virus spread is to ensure early and accurate diagnosis of the viral infection and appropriate quarantine for those infected. The current methods of diagnosis by qPCR or deep sequencing\u2013based technologies rely on the presence of replicating virus in sufficient amounts to ensure that sufficient quantities of virus are collected [7]. This method often fails to detect the viral infection if the collection procedure is not optimal, or if the patient has low viral load due to an early stage of the disease or suppression by host immunity, or if the samples were obtained at a late stage in the course of infection.\nIn this study, we first demonstrated that current SARS-CoV-2\u2013positive plasma did not show any cross-reactivity with other coronaviruses, with the exception of SARS-CoV. It is highly unlikely that these patients were pre-infected with SARS-CoV during the last epidemic in 2002, as we measured IgM reactivity, which is unlikely to last that long. Second, the number of infections with SARS-CoV was limited to 8096 worldwide [18], which only represents a tiny fraction of the Chinese population. However, given the sequence homology between these 2 viruses (>90%), the cross-reactivity is not surprising.\nWe propose conducting antibody testing when a qPCR test is negative despite other indications of COVID-19, including symptoms and epidemiology. Our data show that the supplementary IgM test can provide better sensitivity than a qPCR-based method alone. This is especially important at this stage of the pandemic, where proper diagnosis is essential to limit the virus spread. Although a more sensitive qPCR may improve detection efficacy, the efficacy may still be limited due to various biological reasons as discussed above. However, the more highly sensitive qPCR assays can further improve the detection method when combined with IgM ELISAs.\nWe primarily used a cross-sectional sample of specimens to determine the kinetics of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. This is one of the limitations of our study because each patient has different kinetics for the development of antibodies. The median time of appearance of antibodies is therefore affected by factors such as when the specimen was collected and when the symptom onset took place in each individual patient. Further studies are warranted that use longitudinal sample collection in an unbiased manner to test the kinetics of the antibody response.\nIt is worth noting that approximately 22.0% (18/82) of the patients who were confirmed to be positive by qPCR were found to be negative by the IgM antibody tests. Among the 18 patients, 13 cases were enrolled within less than 7 days after symptom onset, which is probably when the antibodies were not produced in sufficient amounts. Two patients were severe cases and their samples were collected at 19 and 22 days after symptom onset, respectively, suggesting a possible failure of these patients to generate the antibody response, which may have contributed to the disease severity. The remaining 3 patients provided samples between days 9 and 17 after symptom onset. These data suggest that the time course as well as host factors can contribute toward the antibody response to the virus.\nTo confirm the applicability of our method, we prospectively tested a family cluster, with 2 members who were confirmed to be infected by SARS-CoV-2 while the remaining members tested negative using PCR. In contrast, the antibody testing confirmed the viral infections in the 2 patients and in 3 of the 4 close contacts, which were clinically corroborated in 3 of the family members. Moreover, after a variable period of time, one expects the PCR result to become negative as people stop shedding viruses. Presumably, IgG antibodies will remain positive. This would permit the use of serological tools to better understand the overall rate of infection in the community\u2014including the rate of asymptomatic infections. This could potentially enable us to identify healthcare workers who have been infected in the past and might be less prone to becoming infected on the job. Our data also show the ability to detect subclinical infections effectively, a much-needed tool to stop the spread of infection, which is currently spreading at an alarming rate in Europe and the United States. In addition, the higher speed of antibody testing can be useful and applied in remote areas where qPCR assays cannot be performed.\nConclusions\nWe demonstrated the time kinetics of the humoral response during COVID-19 and provided evidence that this can aid in the diagnosis of COVID-19, including in subclinical cases.\nNotes\nAuthor contributions.

This study aimed to clarify the characteristics of patients with refractory COVID-19.\nMethods\nIn this retrospective single-center study, we included 155 consecutive patients with confirmed COVID-19 in Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University from January 1st to February 5th. The cases were divided into general and refractory COVID-19 groups according to the clinical efficacy after hospitalization, and the difference between groups were compared.\nResults\nCompared with general COVID-19 patients (45.2%), refractory patients had an older age, male sex, more underlying comorbidities, lower incidence of fever, higher levels of maximum temperature among fever cases, higher incidence of breath shortness and anorexia, severer disease assessment on admission, high levels of neutrophil, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and C-reactive protein, lower levels of platelets and albumin, and higher incidence of bilateral pneumonia and pleural effusion (P<0.05). Refractory COVID-19 patients were more likely to receive oxygen, mechanical ventilation, expectorant, and adjunctive treatment including corticosteroid, antiviral drugs and immune enhancer (P<0.05). After adjustment, those with refractory COVID-19 were also more likely to have a male sex and manifestations of anorexia and fever on admission, and receive oxygen, expectorant and adjunctive agents (P<0.05) when considering the factors of disease severity on admission, mechanical ventilation, and ICU transfer.\nConclusion\nNearly 50% COVID-19 patients could not reach obvious clinical and radiological remission within 10 days after hospitalization. The patients with male sex, anorexia and no fever on admission predicted poor efficacy.\nCOVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, clinical efficacy, predictors\nTopic: anorexia nervosa fever china pneumonia loss of appetite sars-cov-2 covid-19\nIssue Section: Major Article\nPDF\nThis content is only available as a PDF.\nAuthor notes\n\" contributed equally.\n\u00a9 The Author(s) 2020.

COVID-19 status was confirmed by PCR testing of sputum, nasopharyngeal swabs, or throat swabs. Demographic, clinical, laboratory, and exposure-risk variables ascertainable at presentation were analyzed to develop an algorithm for estimating the risk of COVID-19. Model development used Akaike\u2019s information criterion in a stepwise fashion to build logistic regression models, which were then translated into prediction scores. Performance was measured using receiver operating characteristic curves, adjusting for overconfidence using leave-one-out cross-validation.\nResults\nThe study population included 788 subjects, of whom 54 (6.9%) were SARS-CoV-2 positive and 734 (93.1%) were SARS-CoV-2 negative. The median age was 34 years, and 407 (51.7%) were female. Using leave-one-out cross-validation, all the models incorporating clinical tests (models 1, 2, and 3) performed well with areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUCs) of 0.91, 0.88, and 0.88, respectively. In comparison, model 4 had an AUC of 0.65.\nConclusions\nRapidly ascertainable clinical and laboratory data could identify individuals at high risk of COVID-19 and enable prioritization of PCR testing and containment efforts. Basic laboratory test results were crucial to prediction models.\nCOVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, risk factors, prediction model\nTopic: demography sars-cov-2 covid-19\nIssue Section: Major Article\nOn 31 December 2019, a cluster of atypical pneumonia cases was reported in Wuhan City, China [1]. The etiologic agent was subsequently identified as a novel coronavirus [2], severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) [3]. The disease, named coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) [4], can progress to acute respiratory distress in severe cases [5]. The basic reproduction number of SARS-CoV-2 has been estimated to be 2.2 [6], and human-to-human transmission has since occurred to other parts of China and beyond, affecting 87 137 cases in 59 countries worldwide as of 1 March 2020 [6\u201310].\nThe clinical spectrum of COVID-19 is broad and the majority of infected individuals experience only a mild or subclinical illness, especially in the early phase of illness [11, 12]. Approximately 16% to 26% of hospitalized patients diagnosed with COVID-19 develop severe acute respiratory distress requiring oxygen supplementation and/or intensive care. Disease severity and mortality are associated with older age and underlying comorbidities such as diabetes, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease.\nIn the absence of a vaccine or effective prophylaxis, the containment of SARS-CoV-2 is contingent on interrupting transmission through rapid identification and isolation of all infected individuals. Symptomatic contacts must be isolated early, while close contacts of cases who may be incubating infection need to be quarantined and monitored [13]. Currently, case identification relies on specialized nucleic acid\u2013based reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing, which is not readily available in resource-limited settings [14, 15]. Even in well-resourced settings the broad range of clinical presentation presents a challenge in deciding whom to test and could strain laboratory testing resources if criteria for testing are overly expansive.\nTo allow for assessment of the probability of milder cases having COVID-19, we conducted risk factor analysis on a case-control cohort of 54 COVID-19 cases and 734 controls to determine the epidemiological and clinical risk factors that correlate with COVID-19, and to determine the accuracy of risk-scoring systems based on readily available clinical information.\nMETHODS\nStudy Design and Setting\nThis retrospective case-control study was conducted in Singapore at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID), a 330-bed infectious diseases treatment facility with the onsite National Public Health Laboratory, which develops certified testing protocols for emerging infectious diseases for the country [16]. This work was completed as part of outbreak operational evaluation and did not require institutional research board review. This study followed the Transparent Reporting of a Multivariable Prediction Model for Individual Prognosis or Diagnosis reporting guideline [17].\nStudy Population\nPatients presenting to the NCID for SARS-CoV-2 testing between 26 January and 16 February 2020 were analyzed. Patients were either self-referred, referred from primary care facilities, or were at-risk cases identified by national contact tracing efforts (Supplementary Table 1). Cases were defined as individuals who had a positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR test and controls were defined as individuals for whom all SARS-CoV-2 PCR results were negative (Figure 1 and Supplementary Table 2).\nFigure 1.\nOpen in new tabDownload slide\nStudy subject disposition. Abbreviations: NCID, National Centre for Infectious Diseases, Singapore; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; SARS-CoV-2, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2.\nData Collection\nWe collected the following data recorded at initial presentation for testing from the electronic medical records: demographic characteristics, medical comorbidities, exposure risk factors (including contact with a known COVID-19 case, contact with travellers from China, recent travel history, and visit to a hospital in China within 14 days prior to symptom onset), symptom days prior to presentation, vital signs at first clinical encounter (respiratory rate, blood pressure, temperature, and pulse rate), respiratory symptoms, gastrointestinal symptoms, physical examination finding of pneumonia, radiologic evidence of pneumonia, and blood investigation results (complete blood count, creatinine, sodium, and potassium).\nInvestigation for SARS-CoV-2\nWe collected respiratory specimens in the following order of preference: sputum or endotracheal aspirate, nasopharyngeal swab, and throat swab. For subjects with more than 1 specimen, the first and last specimens were collected at least 24 hours apart. High-risk patients were tested at least twice while low-risk patients were tested at least once according to a predefined algorithm [18]. SARS-CoV-2 tests were performed using one of the methods described in the Supplementary Methods.\nStatistical Analyses\nStudy variables from the 4 abovementioned categories were analyzed for differences between SARS-CoV-2\u2013positive and \u2013negative subjects using Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon test or Yates\u2019 corrected chi-square test. All tests were 2-tailed, and P\u2005<\u2005.05 was considered to be statistically significant.\nDevelopment of Risk-Scoring Models\nA preliminary filtering of variables was conducted by removing those without sufficient variability (<5 positive readings or scores) or with too many missing values (>80% missing). We also assessed variables for collinearity using variance inflation factor and correlation. We defined a lack of multicollinearity between predictors as a variance inflation factor of less than 2.5 or a correlation coefficient of less than 0.6. When 2 variables were found to be colinear, we selected variables for inclusion based on magnitude of effect and clinical relevance.\nPredictors of SARS-CoV-2\u2013positive status were classified into 4 categories: exposure risk factors, demographic variables, clinical findings, and clinical test results. Two datasets were created: one comprising 788 subjects with complete reporting for demographic variables, exposure risk factors, clinical findings, and radiological tests (excluding other clinical tests such as blood tests); the other comprising a subset of 292 subjects with complete reporting for demographic variables, exposure risk factors, clinical findings, and all clinical tests (Figure 1).\nFour prediction models were developed based on these 2 overlapping datasets: model 1 included covariates from all 4 categories; model 2 included demographic variables, clinical findings, and clinical test results; model 3 included demographic variables, clinical findings, and clinical test results (excluding radiology); and model 4 included only demographic variables and clinical findings. Model 4 was built using all 788 subjects (54 cases and 734 controls). Of these 788 subjects, a complete blood count was not performed for 481; testing for creatinine, sodium, and potassium was not performed for 13; and 2 subjects had incomplete creatinine, sodium, and potassium test results. The dataset for models 1, 2, and 3, which included laboratory blood tests, comprised a subset of 292 subjects (49 cases and 243 controls) (Figure 1).\nThe variables for our final models were selected through stepwise use of Akaike\u2019s information criterion to build multivariate logistic regression models, which were then translated into prediction scores.\nEvaluation of Risk-Scoring Models\nThe predictive performance of our final models in determining whether a patient is positive for SARS-CoV-2 was assessed using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and the corresponding area under the ROC (AUC) values with confidence intervals (CIs) for the specificity at a given sensitivity derived using bootstrapping. We performed leave-out-one cross-validation to obtain corrected estimates of sensitivity, specificity, and AUCs of the risk-scoring models. Specifically, each individual was withheld in turn, the model refit to the remaining individuals, and then used to estimate the withheld patient\u2019s risk of COVID-19. This provides a good estimate of the out-of-sample performance of each model. An AUC of 1.00 corresponds to perfect discrimination, whereas an AUC of 0.50 corresponds to no discriminating ability.\nRESULTS\nA total of 991 patients were referred to the NCID for SARS-CoV-2 testing between 26 January and 16 February 2020. We excluded 193 patients whose SARS-CoV-2 results were not yet available, 3 patients whose electronic medical records were not yet available, and 7 patients with unavailable vital sign records. Of the 788 patients included in the analysis, 54 were COVID-19 cases and 734 were controls (Figure 1). The median age was 34 years (range, 7\u201398 years; interquartile range [IQR], 27\u201345 years). The majority were female (407, 51.7%) and Singapore citizens (414, 52.5%). Of the 54 cases, the median age was 42 years (range, 16\u201379 years; IQR, 34\u201354 years), 29 (53.7%) were male and 48 (88.9%) were ethnic Chinese. Singapore citizens and Chinese nationals comprised 34 (63%) and 13 (24.1%) cases, respectively. In the control group, the median age was 34 years (range, 7\u201398 years; IQR, 27\u201343 years), 351 (47.9%) were male, and 553 (75.3%) were ethnic Chinese. Singapore citizens and Chinese nationals comprised 379 (51.7%) and 132 (18.0%) cases, respectively (Table 1).\nTable 1.\nBaseline Characteristics of SARS-CoV-2\u2013Positive and SARS-CoV-2\u2013Negative Subjects\nCharacteristics All (N\u2005=\u2005788) Cases (n\u2005=\u200554) Controls (n\u2005=\u2005734) Pa\nDemographics          \nAge, median, years  34  42  34  <.001 \nGender         \nMale  380 (48.7)  29 (53.7)  351 (47.9)  .488 \nFemale  407 (51.7)  25 (46.3)  382 (52.1)   \nEthnicity         \nChinese   601 (76.3)  48 (88.9)  553 (75.3)  .045 \nMalay   59 (7.5)  1 (1.9)  58 (7.9)   \nIndian   69 (8.8)  5 (9.3)  64 (8.7)   \nOthers  59 (7.5)  0  59 (8.0)   \nNationality         \nSingaporean  414 (52.5)  34 (63.0)  380 (51.8)  .027 \nChinese   145 (18.4)  13 (24.1)  132 (18.0)   \nMalaysian  79 (10.0)  0  79 (10.8)   \nOthers  150 (19.1)  7 (13)  143 (19.5)   \nComorbidities         \nAny  75 (9.5)  5 (9.3)  70 (9.5)  1.000 \nObstructive pulmonary disease  10 (1.3)  0  10 (1.4)  .815 \nCongestive heart failure  1 (0.1)  0   1 (0.1)  1.000 \nConnective tissue disease  4 (0.5)  0   4 (0.5)  1.000 \nCerebrovascular disease  7 (0.9)  0  7 (1.0)  1.000 \nDementia  4 (0.5)  0  4 (0.5)  1.000 \nMyocardial infarction  9 (1.1)  0  9 (1.2)  .877 \nLeukemia  1 (0.1)  0  1 (0.1)  1.000 \nSolid tumor  14 (1.8)  0  14 (1.9)  .624 \nChronic kidney disease  8 (1.0)  0  8 (1.1)  .946 \nDiabetes mellitus  54 (6.9)  5 (9.3)  49 (6.7)  .655 \nChronic liver disease  3 (0.4)  0  3 (0.4)  1.000 \nExposure risk factors          \nHealthcare worker  79 (10.0)  0  79 (10.8)  .021 \nContact with         \nA known COVID-19 case  158 (20.1)  32 (59.3)  126 (17.2)  <.001 \nA traveller from China (from 1 December 2019)  174 (22.1)  11 (20.4)  163 (22.2)  .885 \nA group of travellers from China (from 1 December 2019)  84 (10.7)  7 (13)  77 (10.5)  .734 \nHistory of travel (from 1 December 2019) to          \nWuhan, China  57 (7.2)  15 (27.8)  42 (5.7)  <.001 \nChina (including Wuhan)  236 (30.0)  17 (31.5)  219 (29.8)  .920 \nOther countries (other than China)   216 (27.4)  18 (33.3)  198 (27)  .394 \nVisited any hospital in China recently (14 days since onset of symptoms)  6 (0.8)  0  6 (0.8)  1.000 \nClinical signs and symptoms          \nNumber of subjects with\u2005>5 days of symptoms (n\u2005=\u2005758)b  252 (33.2)  20 (38.5)  232 (32.9)  .38 \nBody temperature, median, \u00baC  37.1  37.5  37.1  .003 \nHeart rate, median, beats per minute  89  87  89  .379 \nRespiration rate, median, breaths per minute   18  18  18  .159 \nSystolic blood pressure, median, mmHg  131  131  131  .502 \nDiastolic blood pressure, median, mmHg  78  78  78  .596 \nCough  564 (71.5)  36 (66.7)  528 (71.9)  .502 \nSputum production  212 (26.9)  13 (24.1)  199 (27.1)  .744 \nShortness of breath  100 (12.7)  7 (13)  93 (12.7)  1.000 \nRhinnorhea or nasal congestion  238 (30.2)  12 (22.2)  226 (30.8)  .242 \nSore throat  350 (44.4)  18 (33.3)  332 (45.2)  .120 \nAuscultation finding of pneumonia (eg, crackles)  42 (5.3)  6 (11.1)  36 (4.9)  .100 \nRespiratory symptoms (other than those listed above)  45 (5.7)  2 (3.7)  43 (5.9)  .723 \nGastrointestinal symptoms  258 (32.8)  20 (37)  238 (32.4)  .585 \nClinical tests         \nCXR/CT suggestive of pneumonia (n\u2005=\u2005788)  104 (13.2)  23 (42.6)  81 (11.1)  <.001 \nComplete blood count (n\u2005=\u2005307)c         \nWhite blood cells, median, \u00d7109/L  7.1  4.7  7.8  <.001 \nHemoglobin, median, g/dL  13.5  13.9  13.4  .102 \nPlatelets, median, \u00d7109/L  242  205  249  <.001 \nNeutrophils, median, \u00d7109/L  4.4  2.5  4.9  <.001 \nLymphocytes, median, \u00d7109/L  1.6  1.2  1.7  <.001 \nEosinophils, median, \u00d7109/L  0.09  0.02  0.10  <.001 \nBasophils, median, \u00d7109/L  0.03  0.02  0.04  <.001 \nRenal panel (n\u2005=\u2005294)d         \nCreatine, median, \u00b5mol/L  63  64  62  .977 \nSodium, median, mmol/L  141  141  141  .600 \nPotassium, median, mmol/L  3.6  3.5  3.6  .156 \nData are presented as n (%) unless otherwise indicated.\nAbbreviations: COVID-19, coronavirus disease 2019; CT, chest computed tomography scan; CXR, chest X-ray; SARS-CoV-2, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2.\naThe Yates\u2019 corrected \u03c7\u200a2 test and Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon test were used to calculate P values for categorical and continuous variables, respectively.\nbThere were a total of 758 subjects who were symptomatic on presentation (52 cases and 706 controls); 30 subjects were asymptomatic on presentation (2 cases and 28 controls).\ncComplete blood count was performed for 307 subjects (out of 788), of whom 52 were cases (out of 54) and 255 were controls (out of 734).\ndRenal panel results were obtained for 294 subjects (out of 788), of whom were 51 were cases (out of 54) and 243 were controls (out of 734).\nOpen in new tab\nPositive cases were more likely to be older compared with controls (P\u2005<\u2005.001). Positive cases were not more likely to have any of the comorbidities documented than controls. In terms of exposure risk factors, positive cases were more likely to have contact with a known COVID-19 case (32 out of 54 cases [59.3%]; 126 out of 734 controls [17.2%]) or have recently travelled to Wuhan, China (15 out of 54 cases [27.8%]; 42 out of 734 controls [5.7%]). Positive cases were more likely to have an elevated body temperature (P\u2005=\u2005.003) at clinical presentation. Of clinical test results, positive cases were more likely to have radiological findings suggestive of pneumonia (23 out of 54 cases [42.6%]; 81 out of 734 controls [11.1%]) as well as lower blood counts of white blood cells, platelets, neutrophils, lymphocytes, eosinophils, and basophils (all P\u2005<\u2005.001) (Table 1).\nSignificant Predictors of a SARS-CoV-2\u2013Positive Test\nThe final covariate risk estimates of each of the 4 multivariable models are detailed in Table 2. In model 1, exposure risk factors most predictive for COVID-19 were travel to Wuhan Province in China since 1 December 2019, around the time of the first outbreak in Wuhan [6] (model 1: adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 23.05; 95% CI, 3.29\u2013268.08) and contact with a confirmed COVID-19 case in Singapore (model 1: AOR, 6.04; 95% CI, 1.54\u201327.61).\nTable 2.\nFinal Covariates in the 4 Multivariate Models for COVID-19 Infection\nVariable Model 1 Model 2 Model 3 Model 4\nAOR (95% CI) P AOR (95% CI) P AOR (95% CI) P AOR (95% CI) P\nAge  \u2026    \u2026        1.03 (1.02\u20131.05)  <.001 \nMale sex  5.98 (1.23\u201336.05)  .038  3.67 (1.03\u201314.12)  .051  3.51 (.97\u201313.89)  .063  \u2026   \nContact with a COVID-19 case  6.04 (1.54\u201327.61)  .013  \u2026    \u2026    \u2026   \nTravel to Wuhan since 1 December 2019  23.05 (3.29\u2013268.08)  .004  \u2026    \u2026    \u2026   \nTravel to China (including Wuhan) since 1 December 2019  0.02 (0\u2013.19)  .002  \u2026    \u2026    \u2026   \nTemperature   4.81 (1.97\u201313.12)  .001  2.55 (1.32\u20135.21)  .007  2.43 (1.25\u20135.02)  .011  2.27 (1.5\u20133.44)  <.001 \nHeart rate  0.95 (.91\u20131)  .044  0.95 (.92\u2013.99)  .01  0.96 (.92\u2013.99)  .029  0.97 (.95\u2013.99)  .01 \nRespiration rate  1.21 (.93\u20131.5)  .079  1.29 (1.07\u20131.59)  .005  1.3 (1.07\u20131.6)  .004  \u2026   \nSystolic blood pressure  \u2026    \u2026    \u2026    0.97 (.95\u2013.99)  .016 \nDiastolic blood pressure  1.04 (.99\u20131.1)  .103  1.04 (1\u20131.09)  .061  1.05 (1\u20131.1)  .044  1.03 (1\u20131.06)  .102 \nSore throat  0.35 (.1\u20131.06)  .073  \u2026    0.53 (.22\u20131.25)  .149  0.63 (.34\u20131.14)  .132 \nSputum production  0.23 (.06\u2013.78)  .024  0.29 (.1\u2013.72)  .011  0.3 (.11\u2013.79)  .019  \u2026   \nShortness of breath  \u2026    \u2026    2.76 (.67\u201310.7)  .145  \u2026   \nGastrointestinal symptoms  3.73 (1.23\u201312.45)  .024  2.69 (1.08\u20136.89)  .035  2.31 (.92\u20135.93)  .076  \u2026   \nCXR/CT suggestive of pneumonia  6.18 (1.68\u201325.75)  .008  2.86 (1.09\u20137.69)  .033  \u2026    \u2026   \nLymphocytes (per 1 \u00d7 109/L)  \u2026    \u2026    0.56 (.25\u20131.12)  .117  \u2026   \nNeutrophils (per 1 \u00d7 109/L)  0.32 (.19\u2013.49)  <.001  0.39 (.26\u2013.54)  <.001  0.38 (.25\u2013.53)  <.001  \u2026   \nEosinophils (per 1 \u00d7 109/L)  0.85 (.78\u2013.91)  <.001  0.89 (.83\u2013.94)  <.001  0.9 (.84\u2013.96)  .002  \u2026   \nCreatinine (per \u00b5mol/L)  0.96 (.9\u20131)  .111  0.96 (.91\u20131)  .062  0.96 (.92\u20131)  .079  \u2026   \nSodium (per mmol/L)  1.17 (.96\u20131.43)  .133  \u2026    \u2026    \u2026   \nAbbreviations: AOR, adjusted odds ratio; CI, confidence interval; COVID-19, coronavirus disease 2019; CT, chest computed tomography scan; CXR, chest X-ray.\nOpen in new tab\nThe other 3 models exclude exposure risk factors.

Abbreviation: AUC, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve.\nDISCUSSION\nAlthough the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of patients with COVID-19 are well described [19, 20], it is challenging for healthcare workers in the primary care or emergency room setting to determine individuals who are more likely to have COVID-19 for isolation and testing. Model 1, incorporating all easily ascertainable data at presentation for SARS-CoV-2 testing, performed exceptionally well with an AUC of 0.91. Additionally, the performance of model 2 suggests that, even in the absence of exposure risk factors, clinical findings and tests can identify subjects at high risk of COVID-19. Furthermore, exclusion of radiologic evidence of pneumonia (model 3) did not significantly impact model performance. However, when basic blood test results such as complete blood count were excluded (model 4), predictive accuracy was reduced substantially.\nThe contact risk factors and clinical findings associated with a positive SARS-CoV-2 test are consistent with the known epidemiology and clinical features of COVID-19. Clinical findings strongly associated with a positive SARS-CoV-2 in our sample were higher temperature, higher respiratory rate, gastrointestinal symptoms, and decreased sputum production. Our results corroborate with a recent analysis [11] incorporating 1099 cases throughout China that found fever (87.9%) and nonproductive cough (67.7%) to be the dominant symptoms. Diarrhea (3.7%), although also reported, was less common. In another study involving 138 SARS-CoV-2\u2013positive inpatients from a hospital in Wuhan, a large proportion of patients presented with fever (98.6%) and dry cough (59.4%). Diarrhea (10.1%) was also reported [12].\nOur findings suggest a strong association of reduced white blood cell count with diagnosis of COVID-19. In the above study of 1099 cases, leukopenia was observed in 33.7% of patients on admission and was more prominent in severe cases [11].\nThe rapid global dissemination of COVID-19, which has significant morbidity with no proven treatment or vaccine, presents a major concern for resource-limited settings with minimal or no access to PCR testing. For well-resourced settings, COVID-19 presents a challenge for healthcare resources to cope with the large numbers of at-risk individuals in need of precautionary (often inpatient) isolation and rapid testing. A risk-scoring system would help prioritize high-risk individuals in primary care and emergency room settings for clinical care, isolation precautions, and contact-tracing efforts.\nMost risk-scoring systems for infectious pathogens include exposure risk variables, which are sensitive to the local epidemiologic context and phase of the global outbreak. Our current pilot analysis suggests that it is feasible to derive risk-scoring systems for COVID-19 diagnosis, which are reliant mainly on clinical findings and simple test results and hence robust to changes in transmission risk factors.\nThe current proposed model is based on a limited dataset and additional validation in larger datasets and across different contexts would increase confidence in its performance and implementation. A trade-off between sensitivity and specificity will also need to be considered\u2014a higher sensitivity will result in larger numbers of individuals needing to be isolated and tested, while a higher specificity will exclude some COVID-19 cases.\nConclusions\nPrediction models that include rapidly ascertainable clinical findings and clinical tests, especially basic blood tests, have sufficient predictive value to identify individuals with a higher probability for COVID-19 and should be considered to stratify at-risk populations for laboratory testing (where available), isolation, and contact-tracing measures.\nSupplementary Data\nSupplementary materials are available at Clinical Infectious Diseases online.

Real-time RT-PCR was used to detect the new coronavirus in respiratory samples.\nResults\nOf the 80 patients infected with COVID-19, 41 were female, with a median age of 46.1 years. Except for 3 severe patients, the rest of the 77 patients exhibited mild or moderate symptoms. Nine patients were unconfirmed until a third nucleic acid test; 38 cases had a history of chronic diseases. The main clinical manifestations of the patients were fever and cough, which accounted for 63 (78.75%) and 51 (63.75%) cases, respectively. Only 3 patients (3.75%) showed liver dysfunction. Imaging examination showed that 55 patients (68.75%) showed abnormal density shadow and 25 cases (31.25%) had no abnormal density shadow in the parenchyma of both lungs. Currently, 21 cases have been discharged from the hospital, and no patient died. The average length of stay for discharged patients was 8 days.\nConclusions\nCompared with the cases in Wuhan, the cases in Jiangsu exhibited mild or moderate symptoms and no obvious gender susceptibility. The proportion of patients having liver dysfunction and abnormal CT imaging was relatively lower than that in Wuhan. Notably, infected patients may be falsely excluded based on 2 consecutively negative respiratory pathogenic nucleic acid test results.\ncoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), clinical characteristics, imported cases, pneumonia\nTopic: diagnostic imaging covid-19\nIssue Section: Major Article\nThe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been recently identified to be caused by a type of B-coronavirus [1]. The virus has enveloped virions that appear as round or oval, often polymorphous, with a diameter of 60\u2013140 nm [2]. It is widely distributed in human and other mammals, and its genome is more distant from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS CoV) [3, 4] and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS CoV) [5, 6]. Since December 2019, a large number of COVID-19 patients have been reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province [7\u20139]. Most of them work in or live around the local Huanan seafood wholesale market, where wild animals are illegally on sale. Severe symptoms of acute respiratory infection appeared within the early stage of this pneumonia, with exacerbating cases where patients developed acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), septic shock, metabolic acidosis, and coagulation dysfunction, which are difficult to correct [10].\nAs of 14 February 2020, 66 577 cases have been confirmed in China, including 54 406 cases in Hubei Province, 37 914 cases in Wuhan City, including medical staff, and several exported cases in Thailand, Singapore, Japan, South Korea, the United States, Australia, and other countries. Considering its highly contagious nature, COVID-19 has been categorized as a class B infectious disease stipulated in the law of the People\u2019s Republic of China on the prevention and control of infectious diseases for the first time, and is managed as class A infectious disease [11].\nSo far, several studies have described the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of patients with COVID-19, but they are all limited to cases in Wuhan and not in other areas [12, 13]. In this study, the clinical characteristics of 80 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 in 3 grade IIIA hospitals of Jiangsu Province are discussed. We believe our findings will provide further details to the epidemic situation and clinical characteristics of this novel coronavirus.\nMETHODS\nPatients\nAll enrolled 80 patients, who were referred to the First People\u2019s Hospital of Yancheng City, the Second People\u2019s Hospital of Yancheng City, and the Fifth People\u2019s Hospital of Wuxi from 22 January to 14 February were retrospectively and consecutively analyzed. According to the arrangements by the Chinese government, all 3 tertiary hospitals provide treatment for all patients who were diagnosed as having COVID-19 according to World Health Organization (WHO) interim guidance [14]. We collected all the data including clinical, demographic, laboratory parameters; chest computed tomography (CT); length of hospitalization and intensive care unit stay; and prognosis from patients\u2019 medical records and attending doctors. The data endpoint was 14 February 2020. The present study was performed in accordance with the Helsinki Declaration and was approved by the Ethics Committee of the First People\u2019s Hospital of Yancheng City. Written informed consent was obtained from participants or their families when data were collected retrospectively.\nAccording to WHO Interim Guidance [14], cases in this study were defined as anyone with the following epidemiological history and consistent with any 2 clinical manifestations and the pathogenic evidence:\nEpidemiological history: (1) within 14 days before the onset of the disease, there were tourism or residence histories in Wuhan or its surrounding areas, or other communities with confirmed cases; (2) within 14 days before the onset of the disease, there were contacts with confirmed cases of COVID-19; (3) within 14 days before the onset of the disease, there were contacts with suspected cases (having fever or respiratory symptoms) from Wuhan or its surrounding areas, or other communities with confirmed cases; (4) aggregation\u2014within 14 days before the onset of the disease, 1 confirmed case was found in an enclosed environment (eg, a family house, a construction site, an office) with 1 or more cases of fever respiratory tract infection found at the same time, revealing potential interpersonal transmission or joint exposure of the disease.\nClinical manifestations: (1) fever and/or respiratory symptoms; (2) imaging indicates multiple mottling and interstitial changes in the lung periphery during the early stage, which subsequently developed into bilateral ground-glass opacity, infiltrates, and lung consolidation; pleural effusion was rarely seen; (3) in the early stage of the disease, the total number of leukocytes was normal or decreased, or the lymphocyte count was decreased.\nPathogenic evidence: the nucleic acid test was used to detect the new coronavirus in respiratory fluid.\nThe patients were clinically classified into 4 types: mild, moderate, severe, or critically ill. The criteria for clinical classifications are shown in Supplementary Table 1.\nStrategy for Nucleic Acid Tests\nOnce a suspected case was admitted to the hospital, the nucleic acid test was carried out immediately. A nose swab and/or throat swab were taken from each patient. The nucleic acid test was considered positive if the result of either of the above samples was positive. If it was negative, the samples would be taken once a day for the next 2 days.\nAfter the treatment, if the patient\u2019s condition improved significantly and there were no respiratory symptoms of fever or cough, the patient would be discharged after passing 2 consecutive nucleic acid tests.\nDetection of Coronavirus\nA total of 150 \u00b5L of sample from throat swab and/or nose swab of each patient was used to extract total RNA. On the basis of the manufacturer\u2019s instructions, total RNA extracted using the respiratory sample RNA isolation kit (Zhongzhi, Wuhan, China) and each sample obtained 40 \u03bcL elution. In order to target the nucleocapsid (N) gene and open reading frame lab (ORF1ab) gene using a 2019 novel coronavirus nucleic acid detection reagent (Bio-germ, Shanghai, China), we used real-time reverse transcriptase\u2013polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) with 5 \u03bcL RNA. The final reaction mixture concentrations of primer and probe were 500 nm and 200 nm, respectively. The sequences used and real-time RT-PCR performance conditions are listed in Supplementary Table 2.\nThe lowest detection concentration is 1 \u00d7 103 copies/mL. There was no cross-reaction with influenza A virus H1N1, H1N1 (2009), H3N2, H5N1, H7N9, influenza B virus (BV and BY types), human coronavirus (229E/HKU1/OC43/NL63/SARS/MERS), parainfluenza virus (1, 2, 3), or rhinovirus A/B/C. No more than 50% blood and less than 0.9 mg/mL of mucin in the sample will not cause interference.\nStatistical Analysis\nStatistical analyses were performed with SPSS (version18.0; SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL). If the continuous measurement is a normal distribution, we present it as a mean (\u00b1SD); if it is not a normal distribution, we present it as a median (interquartile range [IQR]); the classification variable is presented as a count (%). We also evaluated whether the laboratory parameters were outside the normal range.\nRESULTS\nDemographics, Baseline, and Clinical Characteristics of Patients With COVID-19\nIn this study, 80 cases with COVID-19 in Yancheng City and Wuxi City were investigated, including 5 families. All these cases were imported infections (with an epidemiological history of Wuhan) and had no contact with Huanan seafood market in Wuhan. None of these patients were medical staff. Among them, 41 patients (51.25%) were female, with a median age of 46.1 years (IQR, 30.7\u201361.5). Twenty-seven patients (33.75%) were aged 25\u201349 years, 19 patients (23.75%) were aged 50\u201364 years, 15 patients (18.75%) were aged 18\u201324 years, 10 patients (12.50%) were under 18 years old, and 9 patients (11.25%) were over 65 years old (Figure 1). Of the 10 patients under 18 years old, the minimum age was 4, 2 patients were between 6 and 8 years old, and 6 patients were between 11 and 13 years; the maximum age was 14. In term of clinical classification, 28 (35.00%) patients were mild type, 49 (61.25%) patients were moderate type, 3 (3.75%) patients were severe type, and no patient was critically ill. During the diagnostic procedure, we found that 41 patients (51.25%) had a positive result in the first test, and 30 patients (37.50%) had a positive result in the second test. Surprisingly, another 9 patients (11.25%) remained negative until a third test. Of all the 80 patients, 38 cases (47.50%) had a history of chronic diseases, including cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases, endocrine system diseases, digestive system diseases, respiratory system diseases, malignant tumors, and nervous system diseases (Table 1).\nTable 1.\nDemographic, Baseline, and Clinical Characteristics of Patients With COVID-19\nVariables Patients (N\u2005=\u200580)\nAge, years    \nMean \u00b1 SD  46.10\u2005\u00b1\u200515.42 \nAge group, n (%)   \n<18 years  10 (12.50) \n18\u201324 years  15 (18.75) \n25\u201349 years  27 (33.75) \n50\u201364 years  19 (23.75) \n\u226565 years  9 (11.25) \nSex, n (%)   \nFemale  41 (51.25) \nMale  39 (48.75) \nClinical classification, n (%)   \nMild type  28 (35.00) \nModerate type  49 (61.25) \nSevere type  3 (3.75) \nCritically ill type  0 (0.00) \nTypes of infection, n (%)   \nHuanan seafood wholesale market exposure  0 (0.00) \nImported infections  80 (100.00) \nNumber of nucleic acid tests, n (%)   \nFirst time  41 (51.25) \nSecond time  30 (37.50) \nThird time  9 (11.25) \nComorbidities, n (%)   38 (47.50) \nCardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases,cerebrovascular diseasess  25 (31.25) \nEndocrine system diseases  5 (6.25) \nDigestive system disease  3 (3.75) \nRespiratory system diseases  1 (1.25) \nMalignant tumor  1 (1.25) \nNervous system diseases  1 (1.25) \nChronic kidney disease  1 (1.25) \nChronic liver disease  1 (1.25) \nCOPD  0 (0.00) \nHIV infection  0 (0.00) \nSeptic shock  0 (0.00) \nSigns and symptoms at admission, n (%)   \nFever  63 (78.75) \nCough  51 (63.75) \nShortness of breath  30 (37.50) \nMuscle ache  18 (22.50) \nHeadache and mental disorder symptoms  13 (16.25) \nSore throat  11 (13.75) \nRhinorrhea  5 (6.10) \nChest pain  3 (3.75) \nDiarrhea  1 (1.25) \nNausea and vomiting  1 (1.25) \nMore than 1 sign or symptom  66 (82.50) \nChest radiograph and CT findings, n (%)   \nBilateral pneumonia  36 (45.00) \nUnilateral pneumonia   19 (23.75) \nNo abnormal density shadow   25 (31.25)  \nTreatment, n (%)   \nAntibiotic treatment  73 (91.25) \nAntiviral treatment  80 (100.00) \nHormone therapy  12 (14.63) \nIntravenous immunoglobulin therapy  16 (20.00) \nNoninvasive (ie,,face mask)   35 (43.75) \nMechanical ventilation  0 (0.00) \nECMO  0 (0.00) \nTraditional Chinese medicine  3 (3.75) \nClinical outcome, n (%)   \nRemained in hospital  61 (76.25) \nDischarged  21 (23.75) \nDied  0 (0.00) \nAbbreviations: COPD, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; COVID-19, coronavirus disease 2019; CT, computed tomography; ECMO, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation; HIV, human immunodeficiency virus; SD, standard deviation.\nOpen in new tab\nFigure 1.\nOpen in new tabDownload slide\nAge distribution, clinical classification, and nucleic acid tests of patients infected with coronavirus disease 2019. A, Number of confirmed patients by age group; B, number of confirmed patients by different clinical classification; C, number of nucleic acid tests used to confirm patients.\nThe most common symptoms were fever and cough, which accounted for 63 cases (78.75%) and 51 cases (63.75%), respectively. Thirty cases (37.50%) had shortness of breath. In addition, 18 (22.50%) patients had muscle ache, 13 patients (16.25%) had headache and mental disorder symptoms, and no patients had hemoptysis or diarrhea symptoms. The average time from onset to the emergence of shortness of breath was 8.0 days (IQR, 5.0\u201313.0). Except for 10 patients (12.50%) with acute respiratory injury and 2 patients (2.50%) with renal injury, there was no other organ damage (Table 1). The intersections of positive nucleic acid test result and clinical characteristic are shown in Supplementary Table 3.\nLaboratory Findings of Patients With COVID-19\nThe white blood cell (WBC) count of 36 patients (45.00%) was lower than the normal range (4\u2005\u00d7\u2005109/L), and 26 patients (32.50%) had lymphocytopenia (the lymphocyte count was <1.0 \u00d7 109/L). Eleven patients (13.75%) had platelets lower than the normal range (125 \u00d7 109/L), and no patients had platelets higher than the normal range (350 \u00d7 109/L). There were 62 patients (77.50%) with high C-reactive protein (CRP) and 59 patients (73.75%) with a high erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR). Only 1 patient (1.25%) had an elevated procalcitonin (PCT) level.\nIn terms of liver function, only 3 patients (3.75%) showed alanine transaminase (ALT) or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) above the normal range. Two patients (2.50%) had a lower albumin level than the normal range (35 g/L). Eighteen patients (22.50%) had an abnormal myocardial enzyme spectrum, indicating an increase in creatine kinase (CK). The level of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) was increased in 17 patients (21.25%). Two patients (2.50%) had different degrees of renal function damage, one of them had serious renal function damage (Urea: 26.5 mmol/L, creatinine [CREA]: 1054.4 mmol/L). The blood glucose (GLU) level of 19 patients (23.17%) exceeded the normal range (5.9 mmol/L). The level of D-dimer was increased in 3 patients (3.75%). Nine types of respiratory pathogens and influenza A and B nucleic acids were examined in all patients, and bacteria and fungi were cultured simultaneously. The results showed that all patients were negative for the above pathogens (Table 2).\nTable 2.\nLaboratory Findings of Patients With Imported COVID-19\nPatients (N\u2005=\u200580)\nVariables Normal Range (NR) Median (IQR) Above NR, n (%) Below NR, n (%)\nBlood routine examination         \nWhite blood cell count (\u00d7109/L)  3.5\u20139.5  4.1 (3.2\u20135.7)  5 (6.25)  36 (45.00)  \nNeutrophil count (\u00d7109/L)  1.8\u20136.3  4.3 (2.3\u20135.9)  20 (25.00)   \u2026 \nLymphocyte count (\u00d7109/L)  1.1\u20133.2  0.6 (0.4\u20131.0)   \u2026  26 (32.50) \nMonocyte count (\u00d7109/L)  0.1\u20130.6   0.5 (0.3\u20130.7)  15 (18.75)  \u2026 \nPlatelet count (\u00d7109/L)  125.0\u2013350.0  155 (116\u2013188)   0 (0.0)  11 (13.75)  \nHemoglobin (g/L)  130.0\u2013175.0  125.3 (13.4)  \u2026  29 (36.25) \nCoagulation function         \nActivated partial thromboplastin time (s)  21.0\u201337.0  18.6 (17.2\u201328.6)  \u2026  2 (2.50) \nProthrombin time (s)  10.5\u201313.5  10.8 (9.3\u201313.2)  \u2026  3 (3.75) \nD-dimer (\u00b5g/L)  0.0\u20131.5  0.9 (0.4\u20132.4\uff09  3 (3.75)  \u2026 \nBlood biochemistry         \nAlanine aminotransferase (U/L)  9.0\u201350.0  24 (12\u201338)   3 (3.75)  \u2026 \nAspartate aminotransferase (U/L)  15.0\u201340.0  30 (19\u201339)  3 (3.75)  \u2026 \nAlbumin (g/L)  40.0\u201355.0  38.3 (37.0\u201346.2)  \u2026  2 (2.50) \nTotal bilirubin (\u03bcmol/L)  0.0\u201321.0  6.6 (5.4\u201312.0)   1 (1.25)  \u2026 \nBlood urea nitrogen (mmol/L)  3.6\u20139.5  4.9 (3.4\u20135.9)   2 (2.50)  \u2026 \nSerum creatinine (\u03bcmol/L)  57.0\u2013111.0  78 (60\u201390)   2 (2.50)  \u2026 \nLactate dehydrogenase (U/L)  120.0\u2013250.0  226 (182\u2013308)  17 (21.25)  \u2026 \nGlucose (mmol/L)  3.9\u20136.1  6.8 (4.6\u20137.7)  19 (23.17)  \u2026 \nCreatine kinase (U/L)  50.0\u2013310.0  99 (61\u2013191)  18 (22.50)  \u2026 \nCreatine kinase\u2013muscle/brain (U/L)  <25  22 (15\u201325)   16 (20.00)  \u2026 \nInfection-related biomarkers         \nC-reactive protein\u2005\u22655.0 (mg/L)  0.0\u20135.0  6.6 (5.3\u201312.3\uff09  62 (77.50)  \u2026 \nProcalcitonin\u2005\u22655.0 (ng/mL)  0.0\u20135.0  1.3 (0.4\u20132.6\uff09  1 (1.25)  \u2026 \nErythrocyte sedimentation rate\u2005\u226515 (mm/h)  0.0\u201315.0  11.9 (9.0\u201317.2)  59 (73.75)  \u2026 \nAbbreviations: COVID-19, coronavirus disease 2019; IQR, interquartile range; NR, normal range.\nOpen in new tab\nImaging Features of Patients With COVID-19\nOf the 80 patients, 55 (68.75%) showed abnormal chest CT images, consisting of 36 cases (45.00%) of bilateral pneumonia and 19 cases (23.75%) of unilateral pneumonia (Table 1). There were no bilateral lobular and subsegmental consolidation areas, bilateral ground-glass shadows, or subsegmental consolidation areas, and only bilateral ground-glass opacity (Figure 2A) and unilateral ground-glass opacity (Figure 2B). Twenty-five cases (31.25%) had no abnormal density shadow in the parenchyma of both lungs (Figure 2C).\nFigure 2.\nOpen in new tabDownload slide\nChest radiograph images and chest computed tomography (CT) images of 3 patients. A, Chest radiograph images and chest CT images from a 71-year-old woman showing that there are scattered high-density shadows with fuzzy patches in the lower lobes of the 2 lungs, with ground-glass\u2013like changes, with clear hilar structure, unobstructed trachea, no displacement of mediastinum, no enlarged lymph node shadow, and local thickening of bilateral pleura. B, Chest radiograph images and chest CT images from a 38-year-old man showing that there are small patchy ground-glass\u2013like density increasing shadows in the upper and lower lobes of the left lung, with clear hilar structure, unobstructed trachea, no mediastinum displacement, no enlarged lymph node shadow, and no abnormality of pleura on both sides. C, Chest radiograph images and chest CT images from a 12-year-old boy showing that there was no abnormal density shadow in the parenchyma of both lungs, the structure of pulmonary hilus was clear, the trachea was unobstructed, mediastinum was not displaced, and no enlarged lymph node shadow was found.\nTreatment for Patients With COVID-19\nAll patients were treated empirically with a single antibiotic, mainly moxifloxacin. The duration of antibiotic treatment was 3\u201312 days (median, 7 days; IQR, 4\u20139). All patients received ribavirin antiviral therapy for 3\u201312 days (median, 7 days; IQR, 3\u201310). Twelve patients (14.63%) also received methylprednisolone sodium succinate or methylprednisolone for 3\u201312 days (median, 5 days; IQR, 3\u20138). Thirty-five patients (43.75%) were managed with a noninvasive ventilator (ie, face mask). No patient used an invasive ventilator. One patient was supported with hemodialysis. In addition, 3 patients used traditional Chinese medicine (Jian Wei Xiao Shi oral liquid, Jichuan Pharmaceutical Group Co., Ltd., Taixing, China and Xi Yan Ping, Jiangxi Qingfeng Pharmaceutical Co. LTD, Ganzhou, China) to improve their gastrointestinal function.\nPrognosis of Patients With COVID-19\nAs of 14 February, 21 of the 80 patients (23.75%) had been discharged from the hospital. The average length of stay of discharged patients was 8 days. All other patients were still in the hospital for treatment, and no patient died. The discharge standard reference was as follows: body temperature returned to normal for more than 3 days, respiratory symptoms improved significantly, and respiratory pathogenic nucleic acid test was negative for 2 consecutive times (sampling interval at least 1 day).\nDISCUSSION\nIn this multicenter, multi-sample study, 80 cases with COVID-19 in Yancheng and Wuxi were reported. All patients had imported infections. Most of them received a timely diagnosis and treatment as the government formulated an efficient early-warning and isolation program in time. Except for 3 severe patients, the rest of the 77 patients exhibited mild or moderate symptoms. This report provides the latest information on infected patients in 2 cities of Jiangsu Province.\nCOVID-19 was mainly transmitted through respiratory droplets and contact [15]. At present, patients with COVID-19 are the main source of infection [16]. What is more remarkable is that asymptomatic infections can also be a source of infection [17]. The 2 cities mentioned in this study, Wuxi and Yancheng, are respectively located in the South and North of Jiangsu Province, and they are representative in population, economic level, and traffic level.\nCompared with the results of the 2 studies on Wuhan cases by Chen et al [18] and Huang et al [19], we found that the gender proportion was equal in the 80 patients we included, contradicting the conclusion that men are more susceptible than women. This may be related to the insufficient number of samples in these 3 studies. The results may also be influenced by the spreading mode of the disease, as 5 cases of intrafamilial transmission were included in this study. The age distribution of the patients was consistent with the study by Huang et al [19].\nIn terms of clinical classification, 3 patients had severe pneumonia, and 77 patients had mild or moderate symptoms. These imported cases diagnosed in a timely fashion and treated in Jiangsu Province. Since most of the cases in this study were mild, the main symptoms were fever and cough. Ten patients had acute respiratory injury, 2 patients had renal injury, and no other organ damage was found.\nIn terms of laboratory tests, nearly half of the patients had a decreased number of WBCs and one-third of the patients had a decreased number of lymphocytes. In most patients, the CRP level was elevated but the PCT level was normal. All of these changes further illustrated that COVID-19 may exert a major impact on lymphocytes, especially T lymphocytes. The virus spreads and invades through respiratory mucosa, triggers a series of immune responses, and induces the multiple cytokine-release syndrome, resulting in changes in immune components such as peripheral blood leukocytes and lymphocytes [20]. Therefore, intravenous immunoglobulins were used in most patients with decreased WBC and lymphocyte levels.\nIt has been reported that patients with COVID-19 infection are prone to exhibit liver dysfunction, and the potential mechanism is that COVID-19 may directly bind to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)-positive bile duct cells [21, 22]. It is suggested that the liver abnormality of patients with SARS and COVID-19 may not be caused by liver cell damage but by bile duct cell dysfunction and other reasons. In our study, 3 patients had abnormal ALT and AST, and 2 patients had decreased protein levels. In addition, 19 patients had an elevated GLU level, and 18 patients had an abnormal muscle zymogram.\nIn this study, all cases were confirmed by nucleic acid test. The total nucleic acid tests prior to a positive diagnosis for each patient were analyzed. Notably, 9 patients passed 3 tests before they received positive results. Therefore, we consider that if the suspected cases are excluded based on 2 consecutively negative respiratory pathogenic nucleic acid test results (the sampling time is at least 1 day apart), approximately 10% of the infected patients will be missed.\nChest imaging is of great significance for the diagnosis [23]. In the early stage, there were multiple mottling and interstitial changes, especially in the peripheral portion. In severe cases, lung consolidation can occur, but pleural effusion was rare. In the case reports of Wuhan, CT images of all patients were abnormal; 98% of the patients had bilateral involvement. However, in our study, the abnormal rate was relatively lower; 55 patients (68.75%) showed abnormal chest CT images, 36 (45.00%) showed bilateral pneumonia, 19 (23.75%) showed unilateral pneumonia. 25 cases had no abnormality on the first CT, and 23 of them had been diagnosed for more than 4 days. In this regard, we suggest that, when screening patients, clinical manifestations, laboratory examination, and chest imaging should be combined for comprehensive analysis.\nCurrently, there is no specific drug for the treatment of patients with COVID-19 [24, 25]. A US study showed that remdesivir had good therapeutic effect [26]. China has now carried out preliminary clinical trials on this drug [27]. Currently, the clinical treatment mainly includes empirical antibacterial drugs, antiviral treatment with ribavirin, and an appropriate dose of methylprednisolone to alleviate the shortness of breath. At the same time, it is suggested to use traditional Chinese medicine properly to improve the physical signs of patients. In this study, as there was no critical case, no patient used an invasive ventilator. All 3 hospitals followed the above scheme. At present, 21 cases have been discharged from the hospital, with an average length of stay of 8 days, no death was reported, and all other patients were still in the hospital.\nThis study is limited by its retrospective nature. First, due to the limited number of patients, our conclusions need to be further verified by large samples and multicenter data. Second, the prognosis is unavailable at the time of analysis, and extended follow-up time would provide more detailed information about potential risk factors that interfere with clinical outcomes. Third, only 2 cities in Jiangsu Province were selected in this study. Although they are representative, more urban cases need to be included to make the research results more accurate.\nIn conclusion, in-depth study is still needed for patients with COVID-19. Reliable, rapid pathogen detection and practical differential diagnosis based on clinical description are crucial for clinicians to contact suspected patients for the first time, and it is urgent to develop virus vaccines and effective drugs.\nSupplementary Data\nSupplementary materials are available at Clinical Infectious Diseases online.

We draw on Taiwan\u2019s severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) experience to argue that a modified form of traffic control bundling (TCB) protects HCW safety and by extension strengthens overall coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic control.\ntraffic control bundling, healthcare workers, COVID-19, protection\nTopic: disease outbreaks health personnel severe acute respiratory syndrome covid-19\nIssue Section: Brief Report\nWe are daily learning of new developments in prevention and control efforts taken by the Chinese government in response to the COVID-19 outbreak. Particularly notable is the unprecedented scope of several extreme public health containment efforts initiated by the Chinese government to counter the coronavirus\u2019s spread. These actions include regional lockdowns of > 53 million people, severe travel restrictions, and forced quarantines, aimed at least in part at containing the disease during the peak Chinese Lunar New Year travel period.\nWhile the outbreak has had many impacts, here we focus in particular on the impact COVID-19 is having on HCW safety and, by extension, their willingness to continue to work. Through 25 February 2020, China reported 3387 infected HCWs in Hubei alone, at least 18 of whom died, causing growing concern among HCWs [1]. While there are many unknowns regarding COVID-19, several lessons from past outbreaks of similar coronaviruses (eg, SARS-CoV) can be usefully applied to efforts to protect HCWs [2, 3]. We draw primarily on Taiwan\u2019s SARS experiences, but also on lessons learned from the current COVID-19 outbreak to offer recommendations specific to in-hospital preparedness and response with the goal of protecting the front-line HCWs striving to contain the outbreak.\nDuring an outbreak, HCWs are expected to work long hours under significant pressure with often inadequate resources, while accepting the dangers inherent in close interaction with ill patients. HCWs, like everyone else, are vulnerable both to the disease itself and to rumors and incorrect information that necessarily increase their anxiety levels. In our study of the 2003 SARS outbreak, we found that, to varying degrees in both China and Taiwan, HCW anxiety levels rose in reaction to cases of HCWs falling ill or dying. As a result, HCWs became increasingly reluctant to work. HCW anxiety was further impacted by growing stigmatization and loss of trust by their own communities [4, 5]. In short, even as demand for HCWs rapidly rises during an outbreak, so too does HCW anxiety and reluctance to work.\nAs noted, a key source of concern among HCWs is the danger of contracting the disease. In Taiwan, we found that once patients were admitted to hospital, nosocomial SARS outbreaks occurred with transmission via fomites (as occurred during the South Korean Middle East respiratory syndrome outbreak) [2, 3]. Indeed, in Taipei Hoping Hospital, 17 HCWs contracted SARS despite working in separate areas of the hospital with no direct contact with the index patient. Within 2 weeks, the hospital had suffered 150 SARS cases. A post facto study at a separate Taipei hospital found SARS-CoV RNA nucleic acid on water fountains in the triage and observation units, in designated SARS areas, and in supposedly \u201cclean\u201d areas [6]. Though descriptions of viable viral transmission are rare in the literature, detection of RNA nucleic acid in the environment indicates the fingerprint of existing, viable virus in the environment [7]. And, while no firm evidence was found of airborne transmission, SARS-CoV proved able to survive in fomite form in the environment for up to 3 days. Indications are that HCWs were unwittingly spreading SARS and infecting patients and HCWs throughout the hospital via fomites [2, 3].\nThese worsening conditions caused heightened anxiety and distrust of government among HCWs who in some cases refused to work [2, 4]. Today\u2019s hyperconnected society makes information control more challenging, with the result that often exaggerated or misleading information exacerbates already extant anxieties among HCWs.[5]\nFurther contributing to anxiety during the current COVID-19 outbreak is the discovery of increased human-to-human infection via droplet, contact, and fomite transmission [8] and, in particular, the existence of asymptomatic people who are nonetheless ill with SARS-CoV-2 [9, 10]. For example, in Wuhan, 14 HCWs were infected by 1 super-spreader with an atypical presentation, including 1 physician who died as a result [11]. These factors may once again drive a shortage of HCWs, potentially initiating a cycle of substandard infection control procedures leading to hospital cross-transmission and further disease transmission into and within the community. Ultimately, this cycle may contribute to a cascading effect resulting in regional epidemic saturation.\nTo counteract the potential decline in HCW availability due to fear and anxiety, and to curtail the potential rise of nosocomial infection, it is critical to strengthen HCW safety and trust in the system within which they work. To this end, we recommend implementing TCB\u2014a tool that proved effective in dramatically reducing infection rates among HCWs in Taiwan during the SARS outbreak. The essence of TCB involves triage outside of hospitals (in tents or other shelters); ensuring patients are triaged in outdoor screening stations to ensure ill patients are directed to a contamination zone; and zones of risk\u2014clearly delineating separate zones, including a contamination, transition, and clean zone, each separated by checkpoints. We slightly modify the TCB model applied during SARS to address differences between SARS and COVID-19.\nTCB adjusted for COVID-19 begins with outdoor triage. Patients testing positive for COVID-19 are directed to an isolation ward (hot zone) where they are placed in individual isolation rooms for further care. Patients exhibiting atypical symptoms or whose tests remain inconclusive are directed to a quarantine ward (intermediate zone) where they remain for the extent of the incubation period. Patients directed to the isolation or quarantine wards travel via a designated route that avoids contact with the clean zone. Thus, patients move along routes other than those taken by HCWs (here we include nurses, physicians, janitorial staff, and other hospital staff).\nAs described in Figure 1, before moving from the clean zone to the intermediate or hot zones, HCWs must gown up and use gloves, eye protection, and N95 masks. If indicated, they will add additional protective equipment. When returning to the clean zone, HCWs pass through a transition zone where they de-gown and remove all additional protective equipment.\nFigure 1.\nOpen in new tabDownload slide\nConceptual scheme of traffic control bundling. When first arriving, all patients undergo triage outside the hospital. Those diagnosed with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are directed to an isolation ward where they are placed in separate rooms. Those exhibiting atypical symptoms or awaiting confirmed diagnosis are directed to a quarantine ward for the maximum incubation period. In both cases, patients follow a designated route to the relevant ward that avoids the clean zone. Hospital staff transitioning through the zones utilize 75% alcohol dispensers for gloves-on hand sanitation at checkpoints positioned between each zone. Hospital staff don personal protective equipment (PPE) and, as needed, additional equipment such as eye protection and respirators before entering the intermediate or hot zone. When exiting the intermediate or hot zone, hospital staff undergo decontamination and remove PPE in the transition zone. Throughout the decontamination process, hospital staff disinfect their hands, gloved or not, to avoid accidental contact by skin/mucosa with the virus. To adjust for the asymptomatic nature of some cases, all visitors to the hospital must don masks and use 75% alcohol hand sanitizer prior to entry. Abbreviations: HCW, healthcare worker; PPE, personal protective equipment.\nAs they transition between zones, HCWs at each step engage in hand disinfection with 75% alcohol. [2] Each transition point is clearly delineated with signage, doors, and in many cases, with lines painted on the floors (green for clean zones, yellow for intermediate zones, and red for hot zones). To emphasize the importance of adhering to TCB protocols, each transition zone includes prominently posted descriptions of the steps to be taken in that location.\nPrior to implementing TCB, HCWs are thoroughly trained in TCB protocols, including proper gowning and de-gowning practices, correct use of all appropriate personal safety equipment (eg, respirators and eye protection), and how to safely move among the zones. Patients too receive explanations about the various zones and why they are required to remain in their designated zone.\nFinally, we recommend routine daily environmental cleaning and disinfection in the clean and transition zones. To avoid increased danger of HCW infection, cleaning and disinfection in the hot zone is limited, and only required in the case of visible contamination with bodily fluids. We also recommend establishing checkpoints at hospital entrances where visitors disinfect their hands and don masks as a way to further mitigate the risk of droplet/contact and fomite transmission in clean zones.\nIn its assessment of Taiwan\u2019s SARS response, the Taiwan Centers for Disease Control found that TCB dramatically reduced HCW and patient infections. In the 18 hospitals implementing TCB, zero HCWs and only 2 patients developed nosocomial SARS infection. By contrast, in the 33 control hospitals, 115 HCWs and 203 patients developed SARS [2].\nTo conclude, COVID-19 represents a fast-moving threat that has sparked unprecedented actions by China. However, overworked and underresourced HCWs facing the real possibility of infection, and reliant on potentially misleading information about a rapidly developing epidemic, may refuse or be unable to work. The result can be critical HCW shortages. A proven model of coronavirus containment and HCW protection will do much to ease concerns both for HCWs and the patients they serve. Furthermore, it can contribute to breaking the cycle of community\u2013hospital\u2013community infection. We therefore urge public health authorities to implement modified TCB so that protection for HCWs and patients is improved and HCW shortages can be mitigated.\nNotes\nAcknowledgments.

The data on laboratory examinations, including peripheral lymphocyte subsets, were analyzed and compared between patients with severe and nonsevere infection.\nResults\nOf the 452 patients with COVID-19 recruited, 286 were diagnosed as having severe infection. The median age was 58 years and 235 were male. The most common symptoms were fever, shortness of breath, expectoration, fatigue, dry cough, and myalgia. Severe cases tend to have lower lymphocyte counts, higher leukocyte counts and neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), as well as lower percentages of monocytes, eosinophils, and basophils. Most severe cases demonstrated elevated levels of infection-related biomarkers and inflammatory cytokines. The number of T cells significantly decreased, and were more impaired in severe cases. Both helper T (Th) cells and suppressor T cells in patients with COVID-19 were below normal levels, with lower levels of Th cells in the severe group. The percentage of naive Th cells increased and memory Th cells decreased in severe cases. Patients with COVID-19 also have lower levels of regulatory T cells, which are more obviously decreased in severe cases.\nConclusions\nThe novel coronavirus might mainly act on lymphocytes, especially T lymphocytes. Surveillance of NLR and lymphocyte subsets is helpful in the early screening of critical illness, diagnosis, and treatment of COVID-19.\nlymphocyte subsets, T lymphocyte, immune response, COVID-19\nTopic: immune response china lymphocyte subset lymphocytes t-lymphocytes infections covid-19\nIssue Section: Major Article\nThe outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which first emerged in Wuhan in December 2019, has rapidly spread throughout China in the past 2 months [1, 2]. Considering the ongoing outbreak in China and fast worldwide spread of SARS-Cov-2 caused coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19), it has led to the declaration of a Public Health Emergency of International Concern by the World Health Organization (WHO) on 30 January 2020 [3]. As of 16 February 2020, a total of 58\u2005182 laboratory-confirmed cases have been identified in China (primarily in Wuhan), with 1696 fatal cases, according to the data from Chinese government official reports [2].\nIt has been reported that COVID-19 was more likely to occur in older men with comorbidities [1, 4, 5], who have weaker immune functions. As a new type of highly contagious disease in human, the pathophysiology of unusually high pathogenicity for COVID-19 has not yet been completely understood. Several studies have shown that increased amounts of proinflammatory cytokines in serum were associated with pulmonary inflammation and extensive lung damage in SARS [6] and middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection [7], and recently in COVID-19 [1]. However, little is known about lymphocyte subsets and the immune response of patients with COVID-19.\nThis retrospective, single-center study aimed to analyze the expression of infection-related biomarkers, inflammatory cytokines, and lymphocyte subsets by flow cytometry in laboratory-confirmed cases, and compare the difference between severe cases and nonsevere cases.\nMETHODS\nStudy Design and Participants\nWe retrospectively recruited a total of 452 patients with COVID-19 from 10 January to 12 February 2020 at Tongji Hospital, the largest comprehensive medical treatment center of central China and \u201cthe specific hospital for the treatment of severe patients with COVID-19 in Wuhan\u201d designated by the government. The study was performed in accordance with Tongji Hospital Ethics Committee (Institutional Review Board ID: TJ-C20200121). Written informed consent was waived by the Ethics Commission of the designated hospital for emerging infectious disease.\nThe severity of COVID-19 was judged according to the Fifth Revised Trial Version of the Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia Diagnosis and Treatment Guidance [8]. Those who met the following criteria were defined as having severe-type infection: (1) respiratory distress with a respiratory rate over 30 breaths per minute, (2) oxygen saturation \u226493% in the resting state, and (3) arterial blood oxygen partial pressure (PaO2) /oxygen concentration (FiO2) \u2264300 mm Hg.\nData Collection\nData including demographic data, medical history, symptoms, signs, and laboratory findings were collected from patients\u2019 medical records. Laboratory results included blood routine, lymphocyte subsets, infection-related biomarkers, inflammatory cytokines, immunoglobulins, and complement proteins. The total number of lymphocytes in peripheral blood was counted by hemocytometer. Lymphocyte subset percentage were analyzed with a FACSCanto flow cytometer (BD, Franklin Lakes, USA) for those patients with COVID-19 on admission [9]. The absolute numbers of different lymphocyte subsets were calculated by multiplying the percentages with total lymphocyte count. Phorbol 12-Myristate 13-Acetate (PMA)/ionomycin-stimulated lymphocyte function assay was performed as described previously [10]. The percentages of interferon-\u03b3 (IFN-\u03b3)\u2013positive cells in different cell subsets were defined as the active parts of these immune cells. The data were reviewed by a trained team of physicians in Tongji Hospital.\nReal-time Reverse Transcriptase\u2013Polymerase Chain Reaction Assay\nA confirmed COVID-19 case was defined as positive for real-time reverse transcriptase\u2013polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay for nasal and pharyngeal swab specimens according to the WHO guidance. On receipt of the samples, viral RNA extraction was performed using a magnetic viral RNA/DNA extraction kit on a PAN9600 Automated Nucleic Acid Extraction System (Tianlong, Xi\u2019an, China), according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions, followed by PCR screening for the presence of specific 2019-nCoV with a commercial kit (Tianlong, Xi\u2019an, China) in a volume of 25 \u03bcL PCR mixture containing 17.5 \u03bcL reaction solution, 1.5 \u03bcL probes, 1.5 \u03bcL thermus aquaticus (Taq) DNA polymerase, and 5 \u03bcL nucleic acid. Conditions for the amplifications include reverse transcription at 50\u00b0C for 30 minutes, predenaturation at 95\u00b0C for 10 minutes, followed by 5 cycles of 94\u00b0C for 15 seconds, 50\u00b0C for 30 seconds and 72\u00b0C for 30 seconds, and 40 cycles of 94\u00b0C for 10 seconds and 58\u00b0C for 30 seconds for fluorescence detection. A cycle threshold value (Ct value)\u2005\u226437 was defined as a positive test, which was based on the recommendation by the National Institute for Viral Disease Control and Prevention (China).\nStatistical Analysis\nWe describe the categorical variables as frequency rates and percentages and continuous variables as means and SDs, medians and interquartile ranges (IQRs). Independent-group t tests were used for the comparison of means for continuous variables that were normally distributed; conversely, the Mann-Whitney U test was used for continuous variables not normally distributed. Proportions for categorical variables were compared using the \u03c7\u200a2 test. All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS (Statistical Package for the Social Sciences) version 20.0 software (SPSS, Inc). Two-sided P values of less than .05 were considered statistically significant.\nRESULTS\nDemographic and Clinical Characteristics of Patients With COVID-19\nBy 12 February 2020, 452 consecutive patients with COVID-19 on admission to hospitalization at Tongji Hospital were recruited in this study, 286 (63.3%) of whom were clinically diagnosed as having severe infection. Demographic and clinical characteristics of the 452 patients with COVID-19 was shown in Table 1. In total, the median age was 58 years (IQR, 47\u201367; range, 22\u201395 years) and 235 (52.0%) were men. Compared with patients with nonsevere infection, patients with severe infection were significantly older (median age, 61 [IQR, 51\u201369] years vs 53 [IQR, 41\u201362] years; P\u2005<\u2005.001). The proportion of men in the severe group (54.2% men) were not significantly different from the nonsevere group. Of the 452 patients with COVID-19, 201 (44.0%) patients had chronic diseases (ie, hypertension, diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), and a higher percentage in the severe cases (146 [51.0%]) than in the mild cases (55 [33.1%]). And those patients with severe infection were significantly more likely to have concomitant hypertension and cardiovascular diseases (36.7% vs 18.1%; P\u2005<\u2005.001; and 8.4% vs 1.8%; P\u2005=\u2005.004; respectively). The most common symptoms were fever (92.6%), shortness of breath (50.8%), expectoration (41.4%), fatigue (46.4%), dry cough (33.3%), and myalgia (21.4%). Moreover, patients with severe infection were significantly more likely to have shortness of breath and fatigue (58.4% vs 39.2%; P\u2005<\u2005.001; and 51.4% vs 39.2%; P\u2005=\u2005.014; respectively) than patients with nonsevere infection.\nTable 1.\nDemographic and Baseline Characteristics of Patients With COVID-19\nAll Patients (N\u2005=\u2005452) Nonsevere (n\u2005=\u2005166) Severe (n\u2005=\u2005286) P\nCharacteristics         \nAge, median (IQR), range, y  58 (47\u201367), 22\u201395  53 (41.25\u201362), 22\u201392  61 (51\u201369), 26\u201395  <.001 \nSex        .242 \nMale  235 (52.0)  80 (48.2)  155 (54.2)   \nFemale  217 (48.0)  86 (51.8)  131 (45.8)   \nSmoking  7 (1.5)  4 (2.4)  3 (1.0)  .267 \nChronic medical illness         \nAny  201 (44.0)  55 (33.1)  146 (51.0)  <.001 \nChronic obstructive pulmonary disease  12 (2.6)  3 (1.8)  9 (3.1)  .548 \nHypertension  135 (29.5)  30 (18.1)  105 (36.7)  <.001 \nCardiovascular disease  27 (5.9)  3 (1.8)  24 (8.4)  .004 \nCerebrovascular disease  11 (2.4)  3 (1.8)  8 (2.8)  .753 \nChronic liver disease  6 (1.3)  3 (1.8)  3 (1.0)  .674 \nDiabetes  75 (16.4)  22 (13.3)  53 (18.5)  .152 \nTuberculosis  9 (19.7)  2 (1.2)  7 (2.4)  .496 \nMalignant tumor  14 (3.1)  4 (2.4)  10 (3.5)  .587 \nChronic kidney disease  10 (2.2)  4 (2.4)  6 (2.1)  1.000  \nSigns and symptoms         \nFever  423 (92.6)  152 (91.6)  271 (94.8)  .232 \nDry cough  152 (33.3)  56 (33.7)  96 (33.6)  1.000  \nExpectoration  189 (41.4)  68 (41.0)  121 (42.3)  .843 \nHemoptysis  12 (2.6)  2 (1.2)  10 (3.5)  .225 \nShortness of breath  232 (50.8)  65 (39.2)  167 (58.4)  <.001 \nMyalgia  98 (21.4)  32 (19.3)  66 (23.1)  .407 \nConfusion  3 (0.7)  0 (0.0)  3 (1.0)  .301 \nHeadache  52 (11.4)  13 (7.8)  39 (13.6)  .068 \nDizziness  37 (8.1)  9 (5.4)  28 (9.8)  .112 \nFatigue  212 (46.4)  65 (39.2)  147 (51.4)  .014 \nRhinorrhea  8 (1.8)  2 (1.2)  6 (2.1)  .716 \nPharyngalgia  22 (4.8)  10 (6.0)  12 (4.2)  .376 \nAnorexia  96 (21.0)  30 (18.1)  66 (23.1)  .234 \nNausea and vomiting  42 (9.2)  10 (6.0)  32 (11.2)  .092 \nDiarrhea  122 (26.7)  44 (26.5)  78 (27.3)  .913 \nAbdominal pain  23 (5.0)  4 (2.4)  19 (6.6)  .073 \nData are median (IQR), n (%), in which N is the total number of patients with available data.

Among 452 patients who underwent laboratory examinations on admission, most of them tended to have lymphopenia, higher infection-related biomarkers (ie, procalcitonin, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, serum ferritin, and C-reactive protein), and several elevated inflammatory cytokines (ie, tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 [TNF-\u03b1], interleukin [IL]-2R and IL-6), and there were numerous differences in blood cell counts and infection-related biomarkers between the severe group and the nonsevere group. Severe cases had higher leukocyte (5.6 vs 4.9\u2005\u00d7\u2005109; P\u2005<\u2005.001) and neutrophil (4.3 vs 3.2\u2005\u00d7\u2005109; P\u2005<\u2005.001) counts, lower lymphocytes counts (0.8 vs 1.0\u2005\u00d7\u2005109; P\u2005<\u2005.001), a higher neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR; 5.5 vs 3.2; P\u2005<\u2005.001), as well as lower percentages of monocytes (6.6 vs 8.4 %; P\u2005<\u2005.001), eosinophils (0.0 vs 0.2%; P\u2005<\u2005.001), and basophils (0.1 vs 0.2%; P\u2005=\u2005.015). Compared with the nonsevere group, most of severe cases demonstrated elevated levels of infection-related biomarkers, including procalcitonin (0.1 vs 0.05 ng/mL; P\u2005<\u2005.001), serum ferritin (800.4 vs 523.7 ng/mL; P\u2005<\u2005.001), and C-reactive protein (57.9 vs 33.2 mg/L; P\u2005<\u2005.001). Several inflammatory cytokines were also elevated in severe cases compared with the nonsevere cases, including IL-2R (757.0 vs 663.5 U/mL; P\u2005=\u2005.001), IL-6 (25.2 vs 13.3 pg/mL; P\u2005<\u2005.001), IL-8 (18.4 vs 13.7 pg/mL; P\u2005<\u2005.001), IL-10 (6.6 vs 5.0 pg/mL; P\u2005<\u2005.001), and TNF-\u03b1 (8.7 vs 8.4 pg/mL; P\u2005=\u2005.037). Immunoglobulins (IgA, IgG, and IgM) and complement proteins (C3 and C4) in patients with COVID-19 were within the normal range. There were no significant differences in the levels of IgA, IgG, and complement proteins C3 or C4 between the mild and severe groups, while IgM was slightly decreased in severe cases.\nTable 2.\nLaboratory Findings of Patients With COVID-19\nLaboratory Findings Normal Range All Patients (N\u2005=\u2005452) Nonsevere (n\u2005=\u2005166) Severe (n\u2005=\u2005286) P\nBlood routine           \nLeucocytes, \u00d7109/L  3.5\u20139.5  5.3 (3.9\u20137.5)  4.9 (3.7\u20136.1)  5.6 (4.3\u20138.4)  <.001 \nNeutrophils, \u00d7109/L  1.8\u20136.3  3.9 (2.6\u20135.8)  3.2 (2.1\u20134.4)  4.3 (2.9\u20137.0)  <.001 \nNeutrophil percentage, %  40.0\u201375.0  74.3 (64.3\u201383.9)  67.5 (57.8\u201375.8)  77.6 (68.9\u201386.5)  <.001 \nLymphocytes, \u00d7109/L  1.1\u20133.2  0.9 (0.6\u20131.2)  1.0 (0.7\u20131.3)  0.8 (0.6\u20131.1)  <.001 \nLymphocyte percentage, %  20.0\u201350.0  17.5 (10.7\u201325.1)  21.4 (15.3\u201332.5)  14.1(8.8\u201321.4)  <.001 \nNeutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio  \u2026  4.2 (2.5\u20137.7)  3.2 (1.8\u20134.9)  5.5 (3.3\u201310.0)  <.001 \nMonocytes, \u00d7109/L  0.1\u20130.6  0.4 (0.3\u20130.5)  0.4 (0.3\u20130.5)  0.4 (0.3\u20130.5)  .395 \nMonocyte percentage, %  3.0\u201310.0  7.1 (4.9\u20139.6)  8.4 (6.5\u201310.8)  6.6 (4.3\u20138.8)  <.001 \nEosinophils, \u00d7109/L  0.02\u20130.52  0.0 (0.0\u20130.0)  0.0 (0.0\u20130.0)  0.0 (0.0\u20130.0)  <.001 \nEosinophil percentage, %  0.4\u20138.0  0.0 (0.0\u20130.4)  0.2 (0.0\u20130.7)  0.0 (0.0\u20130.2)  <.001 \nBasophils, \u00d7109/L  0.00\u20130.10  0.0 (0.0\u20130.0)  0.0 (0.0\u20130.0)  0.0 (0.0\u20130.0)  .747 \nBasophil percentage, %  0.0\u20131.0  0.1 (0.1\u20130.2)  0.2 (0.0\u20130.3)  0.1 (0.0\u20130.2)  .015 \nInfection-related biomarkers           \nProcalcitonin, ng/mL  0.0\u20130.05  0.1 (0.0\u20130.2)  0.05 (0.03\u20130.09)  0.1 (0.0\u20130.2)  <.001 \nErythrocyte sedimentation rate, mm/h  0.0\u201315.0  31.5 (17.0\u201358.0)   28.0 (14.0\u201350.0)  34.0 (19.0\u201360.0)  .123 \nSerum ferritin, ng/mL  15.0\u2013150.0  662.4 (380.9\u20131311.9)   523.7 (299.1\u2013840.4)  800.4 (452.9\u20131451.6)  <.001 \nC-reactive protein, mg/L  0.0\u20131.0  44.1 (15.5\u201393.5)   33.2 (8.2\u201359.7)  57.9 (20.9\u2013103.2)  <.001 \nInflammatory cytokines           \nTumor necrosis factor-\u03b1, pg/mL  0.0\u20138.1  8.6 (6.9\u201310.9)  8.4 (6.9\u201310.4)  8.7 (7.1\u201311.6)  .037 \nInterleukin-1\u03b2, pg/mL  0.0\u20135.0  5.0 (5.0\u20135.0)  5.0 (5.0\u20135.0)  5.0 (5.0\u20135.0)  .962 \nInterleukin-2R, U/mL  223.0\u2013710.0  714.5 (514.5\u20131040.3)  663.5 (473.3\u2013862.8)  757.0 (528.5\u20131136.3)  .001 \nInterleukin-6, pg/mL  0.0\u20137.0  21.0 (6.1\u201347.2)  13.3 (3.9\u201341.1)  25.2 (9.5\u201354.5)  <.001 \nInterleukin-8, pg/mL  0.0\u201362.0  16.7 (10.2\u201327.0)  13.7 (8.9\u201321.0)  18.4 (11.3\u201328.4)  <.001 \nInterleukin-10, pg/mL  0.0\u20139.1  5.4 (5.0\u20139.7)  5.0 (5.0\u20137.0)  6.6 (5.0\u201311.3)  <.001 \nImmunoglobulins           \nImmunoglobulin A, g/L  0.82\u20134.53  2.21 (1.65\u20132.79)  2.14 (1.66\u20132.71)  2.26 (1.57\u20132.89)  .285 \nImmunoglobulin G, g/L  7.51\u201315.60  11.75 (9.70\u201313.60)  11.85 (10.13\u201313.40)  11.7 (9.53\u201313.8)  .551 \nImmunoglobulin M, g/L  0.46\u20133.04  0.95 (0.70\u20131.31)  1.02 (0.77\u20131.37)  0.90 (0.69\u20131.28)  .033 \nComplement proteins           \nC3, g/L  0.65\u20131.39  0.88 (0.77\u20131.00)  0.88 (0.77\u20131.00)  0.89 (0.77\u20131.00)  .942 \nC4, g/L  0.16\u20130.38  0.26 (0.20\u20130.31)  0.26 (0.20\u20130.31)  0.26 (0.20\u20130.31)  .851 \nData are median (IQR).

No significant differences were found between severe cases and nonsevere cases.\nWe further analyzed different subsets of T cells. Both helper T (Th) cells (CD3+,\u2005CD4+) and suppressor T cells (CD3+,\u2005CD8+) in patients with COVID-19 were below normal levels, and the decline in Th cells was more pronounced in severe cases (285.1 vs 420.5/\u03bcL; P\u2005=\u2005.027). A similar tendency was also shown in the decline in suppressor T cells, although there was no statistical difference between mild and severe cases (P\u2005=\u2005.197). The Th and suppressor T ratio (Th/Ts) remained in the normal range, and showed no difference between the 2 subgroups. The percentage of naive Th cells (CD3+,\u2005CD4+,\u2005CD45RA+) increased (44.5 vs 35.0 %; P\u2005=\u2005.035) and memory Th cells (CD3+,\u2005CD4+,\u2005CD45RO+) decreased (55.5 vs 65.0 %; P\u2005=\u2005.035) in severe cases when compared with nonsevere cases. CD28-positive cytotoxic suppressor T cells (CD3+,\u2005CD8+,\u2005CD28+) percentage decreased in severe cases (54.5 vs 67.0 %; P\u2005=\u2005.035), while no significant difference was found in activated T cells (CD3+,\u2005HLA-DR+) and activated suppressor T cells (CD3+,\u2005CD8+,\u2005HLA-DR+). Patients with COVID-19 presented lower levels of regulatory T cells (CD3+,\u2005CD4+,\u2005CD25+,\u2005CD127low+), which was particularly obvious in severe cases (3.7 vs 4.5/\u03bcL; P\u2005=\u2005.040). The decline in naive (CD45RA+,\u2005CD3+,\u2005CD4+,\u2005CD25+,\u2005CD127low+) and induced regulatory T cells (CD45RO+,\u2005CD3+,\u2005CD4+,\u2005CD25+,\u2005CD127low+) had a more obvious trend in the severe group, although there was no significant difference.\nDISCUSSION\nWe report here a dysregulated immune system in a cohort of 452 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 in Wuhan, China. Increases in NLR and T lymphopenia\u2014in particular, a decrease in CD4+\u2005T cells\u2014were common among patients with COVID-19, and more evident in the severe cases, but there was no significant change in the number of CD8+\u2005cells and B cells. Based on these data, we suggest that COVID-19 might damage lymphocytes, especially T lymphocytes, and the immune system is impaired during the period of disease.\nIn the cohort, we observed that 44.0% of patients had at least 1 underlying disorder (ie, hypertension, diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), and a higher percentage of hypertension and cardiovascular disease in the severe cases than in the mild cases, which is consistent with reports [1, 11] that suggested that COVID-19 is more likely to infect elderly men with chronic comorbidities due to weaker immune functions.\nIn terms of laboratory tests, we noted that most of the infected patients presented with lymphopenia and elevated levels of infection-related biomarkers, More interestingly, a higher number of neutrophils and a lower number of lymphocytes (ie, the increase in NLR) were found in the severe group with COVID-19 compared with the mild group. NLR, a well-known marker of systemic inflammation and infection, has been studied as a predictor of bacterial infection, included pneumonia [12\u201314]. The increase in NLR in our study, consistent with the findings from Wang et al [11] that several patients with COVID-19 had an increased neutrophil count and a decreased lymphocyte count during the severe phase, indicated the potential critical condition and serious disturbance of internal environment in those severe infected cases.\nHigher serum levels of proinflammatory cytokines (TNF-\u03b1, IL-1, and IL-6) and chemokines (IL-8) were found in patients with severe COVID-19 compared with individuals with mild disease, similar to the results in SARS and MERS [6, 15]. Cytokines and chemokines have been thought to play an important role in immunity and immunopathology during viral infections [15, 16]. Although there is no direct evidence for the involvement of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines in lung pathology during COVID-19, the changes in laboratory parameters, including elevated serum cytokine, chemokine levels, and increased NLR in infected patients, were correlated with the severity of the disease and adverse outcome, suggesting a possible role for hyperinflammatory responses in COVID-19 pathogenesis.\nVirus-induced direct cytopathic effects and viral evasion of host immune responses are believed to play major roles in disease severity [15, 16]. A rapid and well-coordinated innate immune response is the first line of defense against viral infections; however, when the immune response is dysregulated, it will result in excessive inflammation, and even cause death [17]. In our study, we demonstrated pronounced lymphopenia and low counts of CD3+\u2005cells and CD4+\u2005cells in COVID-19 cases. The differentiation of naive CD4+\u2005T cells into effector and memory subsets is one of the most fundamental facets of T-cell\u2013mediated immunity [18]. And the balance between the naive and memory CD4+\u2005T cells is crucial for maintaining an efficient immune response. Our results of lymphocyte subsets with higher naive CD4+\u2005T-cell subpopulations and smaller percentages of memory cells and a higher naive-to-memory CD4+ T-cell ratio in severe cases indicated that the immune system in the severe infection subgroup was impaired more severely. In addition, the decrease in regulatory T cells, especially induced regulatory T cells, which have a key role in restraining allergic inflammation at mucosal surfaces, was demonstrated in those infected patients, especially in the severe group. Furthermore, a similar tendency was also present in naive regulatory T cells, which underlie the control of systemic and tissue-specific autoimmunity. It has been shown that T cells, especially CD4+\u2005and CD8+\u2005T cells, play an important role in weakening or dampening overactive innate immune responses during viral infection [17], although regulatory T cells, a subset of Th cells, play a crucial role in negatively regulating the activation, proliferation, and effector functions of a wide range of immune cells for the maintenance of self-tolerance and immune homeostasis [19, 20]. Given the higher expression of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines in patients with COVID-19, especially in the severe cases, the consumption of CD4+\u2005and CD8+\u2005T cells, and the decrease in regulatory T cells, presented in our study might result in aggravated inflammatory responses and the production of a cytokine storm, and worsen damaged tissue. Although not conclusive, correlative evidence from those patients with severe infection with a lower number of lymphocytes suggested a role for dysregulated immune responses in COVID-19 pathogenesis.\nThere were several limitations to our study that might cause some potential bias. First, it was a retrospective, single-center, small-sample study of patients admitted to the hospital; standardized data for a larger cohort would be better to assess the temporal change in immune response after infection with COVID-19. Second, co-infection with bacteria or superinfection might affect the results of the immune response in those patients with COVID-19. Most of them presented with an increase in NLR and procalcitonin, which was more evident in severe cases, and indicated potential bacterial coinfection due to a dysregulated immune system. Despite that, our study demonstrated several novel findings on dysregulated immune response in patients with COVID-19 that SARS-CoV-2 might mainly act on lymphocytes, especially T lymphocytes, induce a cytokine storm in the body, and generate a series of immune responses to damage the corresponding organs; thus, surveillance of NLR and lymphocyte subsets is helpful in the early screening of critical illness and diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19.\nNote\nPotential conflicts of interest.

We selected baseline clinical and laboratory data through the stepwise Akaike information criterion and ensemble XGBoost model to build mortality-prediction models. We then validated these models by randomly collecting COVID-19 patients in the Infection department of Union Hospital in Wuhan from January 1, 2020, to February 20, 2020.\nResults\n296 patients with COVID-19 were enrolled in the training cohort, 19 of whom died during hospitalization and 277 were discharged from the hospital. The clinical model developed with age, history of hypertension and coronary heart disease showed AUC of 0.88 (95% CI, 0.80-0.95); threshold, -2.6551; sensitivity, 92.31%; specificity, 77.44% and negative predictive value (NPV), 99.34%. The laboratory model developed with age, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP), peripheral capillary oxygen saturation (SpO2), neutrophil and lymphocyte count, D-dimer, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and glomerular filtration rate (GFR) had a significantly stronger discriminatory power than the clinical model (p=0.0157), with AUC of 0.98 (95% CI, 0.92-0.99); threshold, -2.998; sensitivity, 100.00%; specificity, 92.82% and NPV, 100.00%. In the subsequent validation cohort (N=44), the AUCs (95% CI) were 0.83 (0.68, 0.93) and 0.88 (0.75, 0.96) for clinical model and laboratory model, respectively.\nConclusions\nWe developed two predictive models for the in-hospital mortality of patients with COVID-19 in Wuhan and validated in patients from another center.\nCOVID-19, Predictive model, Mortality\nTopic: china hospital mortality mortality covid-19\nIssue Section: Major Article\nPDF\nThis content is only available as a PDF.\nAuthor notes\n\" Contributed equally\n\u00a9 The Author(s) 2020.

Data are urgently needed about risk factors associated with clinical outcomes.\nMethods\nA retrospective review of 323 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in Wuhan was conducted. Patients were classified into three disease severity groups (non-severe, severe, and critical), based on initial clinical presentation. Clinical outcomes were designated as favorable and unfavorable, based on disease progression and response to treatments. Logistic regression models were performed to identify risk factors associated with clinical outcomes, and log-rank test was conducted for the association with clinical progression.\nResults\nCurrent standard treatments did not show significant improvement in patient outcomes. By univariate logistic regression analysis, 27 risk factors were significantly associated with clinical outcomes. Multivariate regression indicated age over 65 years (p<0.001), smoking (p=0.001), critical disease status (p=0.002), diabetes (p=0.025), high hypersensitive troponin I (>0.04 pg/mL, p=0.02), leukocytosis (>10 x 109/L, p<0.001) and neutrophilia (>75 x 109/L, p<0.001) predicted unfavorable clinical outcomes. By contrast, the administration of hypnotics was significantly associated with favorable outcomes (p<0.001), which was confirmed by survival analysis.\nConclusions\nHypnotics may be an effective ancillary treatment for COVID-19. We also found novel risk factors, such as higher hypersensitive troponin I, predicted poor clinical outcomes. Overall, our study provides useful data to guide early clinical decision making to reduce mortality and improve clinical outcomes of COVID-19.\nCOVID-19, Risk Factor, Clinical Outcome, Hypnotics, Obesity\nTopic: china inpatients treatment outcome hypnotics covid-19\nIssue Section: Major Article\nPDF\nThis content is only available as a PDF.\nAuthor notes\n\" Contributed equally\n\u00a9 The Author(s) 2020.

Articles presenting clinical data for patients with coronavirus infection (defined as SARS-1, MERS, SARS-COV-2, and other coronavirus) and bacterial/fungal co-infection reported in English, Mandarin, or Italian were included. Data describing bacterial/fungal co-infections, treatments, and outcomes were extracted. Secondary analysis of studies reporting antimicrobial prescribing in SARS-COV-2 even in the absence of co-infection was performed.\nResults\n1007 abstracts were identified. Eighteen full texts reported bacterial/fungal co-infection were included. Most studies did not identify or report bacterial/fungal coinfection (85/140;61%). 9/18 (50%) studies reported on COVID-19, 5/18 (28%) SARS-1, 1/18 (6%) MERS, and 3/18 (17%) other coronavirus.\nFor COVID-19, 62/806 (8%) patients were reported as experiencing bacterial/fungal co-infection during hospital admission. Secondary analysis demonstrated wide use of broad-spectrum antibacterials, despite a paucity of evidence for bacterial coinfection. On secondary analysis, 1450/2010 (72%) of patients reported received antimicrobial therapy. No antimicrobial stewardship interventions were described.\nFor non-COVID-19 cases bacterial/fungal co-infection was reported in 89/815 (11%) of patients. Broad-spectrum antibiotic use was reported.\nConclusions\nDespite frequent prescription of broad-spectrum empirical antimicrobials in patients with coronavirus associated respiratory infections, there is a paucity of data to support the association with respiratory bacterial/fungal co-infection.

Though diagnostic tests are fundamental to the ability to detect and respond, overwhelmed healthcare systems are already experiencing shortages of reagents associated with this test, calling for a lean immediately-applicable protocol.\nMethods\nRNA extracts of positive samples were tested for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 using RT-qPCR, alone or in pools of different sizes (2-, 4-, 8- ,16-, 32- and 64-sample pools) with negative samples. Transport media of additional 3 positive samples were also tested when mixed with transport media of negative samples in pools of 8.\nResults\nA single positive sample can be detected in pools of up to 32 samples, using the standard kits and protocols, with an estimated false negative rate of 10%. Detection of positive samples diluted in even up to 64 samples may also be attainable, though may require additional amplification cycles. Single positive samples can be detected when pooling either after or prior to RNA extraction.\nConclusions\nAs it uses the standard protocols, reagents and equipment, this pooling method can be applied immediately in current clinical testing laboratories. We hope that such implementation of a pool test for COVID-19 would allow expanding current screening capacities thereby enabling the expansion of detection in the community, as well as in close organic groups, such as hospital departments, army units, or factory shifts.\nSARS-CoV-2, COVID-19, diagnostics, disease surveillance\nTopic: diagnostic techniques and procedures hospital departments laboratory diagnosis rna surveillance, medical pandemics health care systems false-negative results community amplification army sars-cov-2 covid-19\nIssue Section: Major Article\nPDF\nThis content is only available as a PDF.\nAuthor notes\n\" These authors contributed equally to this manuscript\n\u00a9 The Author(s) 2020.

No studies have specifically assessed COVID-19-associated superinfections or AMR. Based on limited data from case series, it is reasonable to anticipate that an appreciable minority of patients with severe COVID-19 will develop superinfections, most commonly pneumonia due to nosocomial bacteria and Aspergillus. Microbiology and AMR patterns are likely to reflect institutional ecology. Broad-spectrum antimicrobial use is likely to be widespread among hospitalized patients, both as directed and empiric therapy. Stewardship will have a crucial role in limiting unnecessary antimicrobial use and AMR. Congressional COVID-19 relief bills are considering antimicrobial reimbursement reforms and antimicrobial subscription models, but it is unclear if these will be included in final legislation. Prospective studies on COVID-19 superinfections are needed, data from which can inform rational antimicrobial treatment and stewardship strategies, and models for market reform and sustainable drug development.\nCoronavirus disease 2019, COVID-19, superinfections, antimicrobial resistance, antimicrobial development\nTopic: drug resistance, microbial superinfection antimicrobials covid-19\nIssue Section: Viewpoints\nPDF\nThis content is only available as a PDF.\n\u00a9 The Author(s) 2020.

The World Health Organization has recently declared that COVID-19 a public health emergency of international concern [4]. The diagnosis of COVID-19 needs a fluorescent reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) kit for nucleic acid detection [1\u20133]. Our finding emphasizes the disturbing possibility that swabs are not sensitive for COVID-19 at early stages of the clinical presentation.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nWe recruited 3 patients from 29 January to 2 February 2020 in Shenzhen University General Hospital who showed negative results before computed tomographic (CT) examination and were finally confirmed positive for SARS-CoV-2 by real-time RT-PCR (rRT-PCR) assay. All 3 patients had a definitive history of exposure to close contact with confirmed patients.\nThe specimens collected included nasopharyngeal swab and blood sample; samples were transported as routine. The nasopharyngeal swab was placed into a sterile sampling tube containing 1 mL of virus delivery medium, covered, and sealed. Serum samples were stored in disposable serum storage tubes. The detection of SARS-CoV-2 was performed with rRT-PCR kit (Daan, Guangzhou Daan Clinical Laboratory Center) in the laboratory department in our hospital and the local Center for Disease Control and Prevention. Validation was tested on positive and negative controls on each batch of tests.\nChest CT scans were performed on a Revolution 256 row CT scanner (General Electric Company) and imaged with 1.25-mm slice thickness CT. The CT images were read independently by 2 radiologists with > 10 years\u2019 experience on chest CT who were blinded to the clinical data.\nEPIDEMIOLOGICAL, CLINICAL, AND IMAGING TIME COURSE\nFigure 1 describes the timeline of the epidemiological exposure, clinical and laboratory examinations, and CT imaging during the course of illness. Here we define the last day of exposure as day 0. A 47-year-old woman (patient 1) became ill with fever of 37.9\u00b0C; her fever came down the following day and the patient started coughing occasionally, which developed into frequent dry cough with occasional phlegm. CT examination was carried out on the third day. Patient 2 (age 45 years, female) and patient 3 (age 65 years, female) both experienced an onset of fever and a sore throat and dry cough; their symptoms had not evidently changed up to the time of CT examination and the collection of the first positive nasopharyngeal swabs. CT examination was performed on the first and fourth day in patients 2 and 3, respectively. The time of PCR of SARS-CoV-2 testing is shown in Figure 1.\nFigure 1.\nOpen in new tabDownload slide\nEpidemiological exposure, clinical, laboratory, and computed tomographic imaging timeline during the course of illness. Abbreviations: CT, computed tomography; PCR, polymerase chain reaction.\nCT IMAGING FEATURES\nAll 3 patients had abnormal CT findings. CT imaging of patient 1 (Figure 2) showed that the disease was in the progressive stage. The bilateral, multifocal fusion structure of ground glass opacity (GGO) and multilobular infiltration were clearly documented, and an air space nodule could be seen in the left upper lobe lesion. Images of patients 2 and 3 (Figure 3) show peripheral multifocal GGOs, and interlobular septal thickening (\u201ccrazy-paving\u201d pattern) could be seen in some regions.\nDISCUSSION\nThe CT imaging of patients 2 and 3 had similar features, with both showing mild pneumonia. CT features included peripheral multifocal GGOs, which are common CT findings in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia [5\u20138]. In patient 1, the disease was in the progressive stage, with bilateral features, multifocal fusion structure of GGOs, and multilobular infiltration, whereas the PCR was still negative. Chest CT may be helpful in some situations such as early detection of severe or critical cases.\nDetection of the nucleic acid of virus was still negative in the 3 patients on the sixth to eighth day after onset of disease. Such patients may be missed if the surveillance case definition focuses heavily on early virus detection. These cases show the challenges in the management of COVID-19 pneumonia and suggest that PCR testing of nasopharyngeal swabs probably is not sensitive for COVID-19 at early stages of the clinical presentation. Ongoing efforts may be needed for epidemiologists to seek the use of nasopharyngeal swabs or other specimens, such as noninvasive saliva obtained at a single point in time, from complicated situations as a tool to rule in or rule out SARS-CoV-2 infection for clinical or epidemiologic purposes.\nFigure 2.\nOpen in new tabDownload slide\nPatient 1 (47-year-old woman) presenting with fever and cough.

As of 13 February 2020, over 59 000 confirmed cases of the 2019 novel coronavirus infection (COVID-19) in China have been reported, and more than 440 cases in many other countries, with an approximately 2% mortality rate [2]. Evidence pointing to the person-to-person transmission in hospital and family settings has been accumulating, but the modes of transmission are incompletely defined, with no effective treatments or vaccines until now [3\u20135].\nAccording to previous studies [6\u20139], pregnant women are at high risk of developing viral infection, such as influenza-A, H1N1, SARS-CoV, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and Ebola virus, and appear to have worse clinical outcomes, including maternal mortality, stillbirth, spontaneous abortion, and preterm delivery, compared with non-pregnant women. However, there are only limited data about the clinical features of COVID-19 during pregnancy. In this study, we report a case of a 30-week pregnant woman with COVID-19 who gave birth to an infant with no evidence of COVID-19.\nCase Report\nOn 2 February 2020, a 28-year-old female, who was 30 weeks pregnant, presented to a fever clinic of Suzhou Municipal Hospital with intermittent fever for 1 week. She disclosed that she had returned to Suzhou on 24 January after traveling to visit family in Wuhan 3 weeks previously. Given the patient\u2019s travel history and fever, 2 throat-swab samples were collected and tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 with the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention\u2013recommended kit (BioGerm, Shanghai, China), following World Health Organization guidelines for quantitative RT-PCR. Chest computed tomography (CT) scan on 4 February demonstrated left-sided subpleural patchy consolidation and right-sided ground-glass opacities (Figure 1A). The patient then went into isolation at that hospital. On 6 February the second SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR results of her sputum came back positive, so she was then transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) in a negative-pressure isolation room of the Affiliated Infectious Hospital of Soochow University, the designated medical center for COVID-19 in Suzhou.\nFigure 1.\nOpen in new tabDownload slide\nChest computed tomography scans (transverse plane) of the mother.

Bilateral multiple ground-glass opacities. E, 18 February 2020 (hospital day 13, postoperative day 10). Bilateral ground-glass opacities, with resolution compared with panel D.\nOn admission, the physical examination revealed a body temperature of 36.2\u00b0C, blood pressure of 95/64 mm Hg, pulse of 92 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% with a facial mask at 5 L per minute of oxygen. Other laboratory findings included a leukocyte count of 10.60 \u00d7 109/L, neutrophils of 9.14 \u00d7 109/L, lymphocytes of 0.86 \u00d7 109/L, albumin of 24.6 g/L, C-reactive protein of 19.6 mg/L, D-dimer of 840 \u03bcg/L, procalcitonin (PCT) of 0.288 ng/mL, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) of 544 U/L, and N-terminal probrain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) of 318 pg/mL. Levels of creatinine and aminotransferase were within normal limits. A fetal ultrasound revealed a normal intrauterine fetus with normal anatomy of approximately 30 weeks of gestational age.\nSince SARS-CoV-2 is a newly identified virus, it remains unknown whether viral shedding during delivery occurs or vertical transmission exists. Several multidisciplinary consultations were performed, concluding that given the current situation, in particular the CT scan and low levels of lymphocytes and albumin, the patient\u2019s condition might deteriorate at any time, and she was at risk of preterm birth. After emergency scenarios for the patient, treatment with Arbidol tablets (Suzhou Pharmaceutical Factory) (0.2 g administered orally every 8 hours), lopinavir and ritonavir tablets (400/100 mg administered orally every 8 hours), cefoperazone sodium and sulbactam sodium (3.0 g administered intravenously every 8 hours), and human serum albumin (20 g administered intravenously every day) were initiated; dexamethasone and magnesium sulfate as prophylaxis for the fetus were given; and an emergency cesarean section was prepared. On hospital day 3 morning (8 February), a repeated chest CT scan showed bilateral multiple ground-glass opacities (Figure 1B), a finding consistent with severe atypical pneumonia. In the afternoon, fetal movement and variability in fetal heart rate monitoring were not detected, and no improvement was shown on noninvasive ventilation for 4 hours.\nAfter a multidisciplinary consultation was performed and informed consent was obtained, an emergency cesarean section under combined spinal-epidural anesthesia was performed, with an estimated blood loss of 200 mL, in a designated negative-pressure isolation room; all personnel involved wore protective gear, including gown, a N95 mask, eye protection, and gloves.\nA preterm male infant weighing 1.83 kg was delivered uneventfully, with Apgar scores of 9 and 10 at 1 and 5 minutes, respectively. He was kept in the isolation ICU of the neonatal nursery for observation without any contact with his mother after birth. The newborn was given formula instead of breast milk. During the delivery, samples of amniotic fluid, placenta, umbilical cord blood, gastric juice, and throat swabs of the infant were obtained for SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR tests, and all results were negative. On day 3 after cesarean section (11 February), RT-PCR analyses of the neonatal throat swab and stool samples were negative. On 15 and 17 February, throat-swab RT-PCR tests of the mother and the infant were negative. Three chest CT scans of the mother on 12, 15, and 18, respectively, demonstrated resolution of infiltrates of both lung fields (Figure 1D, E). All healthcare workers in contact with the infant during his delivery and subsequent care remained asymptomatic. The patient and her infant had an uneventful postpartum and neonatal course.\nDISCUSSION\nSARS-CoV-2 is a newly identified virus, spreading quickly from Wuhan to different parts of China and the world. Respiratory droplet transmission is the main route of SARS-CoV-2, and it can also be transmitted through contact [3]. Several studies [6\u20139] revealed that pregnant women with different viral respiratory illness were at high risk of developing obstetric complications and perinatal adverse outcomes compared with non-pregnant women due to changes in immune responses [10]. According to a previous report of 10 pregnant patients with SARS in Hong Kong [11], SARS-CoV infection could be associated with poor pregnancy outcomes, including critical maternal illness, spontaneous abortion, maternal death, or preterm birth.\nIn this case, we report that a mother with COVID-19 gave birth to a healthy infant with no evidence of COVID-19 after her 30-week pregnancy. Our case ended up with an uneventful postpartum and neonatal course. The RT-PCR tests were all negative, suggesting that the infant was unaffected by COVID-19, and all healthcare workers taking care of him remained asymptomatic.\nSeveral reasons might have contributed to the uneventful perinatal course. First, this patient was a healthy young woman without a special medical history, and regular follow-ups in the obstetrics clinic reveled that she and the fetus were healthy before this infection. And early detection of COVID-19 and the late stage of gestation were also essential. Second, our medical center was a designated hospital for COVID-19 in Suzhou since the virus outbreak in China, and all of the healthcare workers received systemic training for strict isolation and protection measures, such as the use of protective equipment, hand hygiene, safe waste management, environmental cleaning, and sterilization of medical equipment, and followed the correct procedures during medical practice. Much experience has been accumulating in the past few weeks from dozens of patients infected by SARS-CoV-2, including a 19-month-old boy, the youngest patient in Suzhou to date. The patient in our case was ideally cared for by a multidisciplinary medical team, including obstetrics, pediatrics, infectious diseases, anesthesia, ICU, a nosocomial infection-control expert, and administrative staff. Timely and effective consultations were obtained to discuss her case. Last, careful transmission precautions with the infant, including contact, droplet, and airborne precautions, seem to be of great significance. Given the high infectivity and undefined transmission mode, some infection-control protocols applicable for the operating room were developed for patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19. Some infected cases in China demonstrated viral shedding in feces, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 might be present in other body parts, so those precautions during delivery were necessary in case transmission during delivery exists.\nOur case provides an initial view of the outcome associated with pregnancy-related COVID-19 and several effective strategies for managing pregnant women with COVID-19. Comprehensive data on larger numbers of pregnant women with COVID-19 are required to better understand the overall impact of SARS-CoV-2 on maternal and birth outcomes.\nNotes\nAuthors\u2019 contributions.

Compared to these countries, the United States has a higher incarceration rate, with 10.6 million people booked into jails each year [2]. Jails pose a unique set of challenges to COVID-19 prevention, detection, and management mitigation that deserves immediate attention.\nSocial distancing to reduce the rate of disease transmission is not feasible in jails, where people are confined to small living spaces and institutions are often over capacity [3, 4]. Handwashing can be undermined by policies limiting soap access or requiring individual purchase of soap (at a marked-up price) [5, 6]. Many jails restrict access to hand sanitizer, which contains alcohol, fearing individuals will ingest it. Along with structural barriers to disease prevention, there are administrative challenges\u2014largely driven by lack of financial resources\u2014that impede timely access to healthcare professionals when sick [7]. This is especially concerning because jails have a high proportion of people with underlying health conditions [3, 8], making them more susceptible to severe COVID-19 infection [7]. There are several reasons why people who are infected may be reluctant to self-identify symptoms, including unknown duration of detainment [9], fear of being isolated, or losing privileges (eg, television, phone calls) in a medical unit [10]. Furthermore, increased risk of COVID-19 exposure in jails confers higher risk of transmission in the community upon release, with challenges surrounding then notifying those exposed who have limited access to stable housing or phones [11].\nWe have developed a list of recommendations to facilitate and augment COVID-19 mitigation polices in jails (Figure 1). At the most basic level, funds should be allocated to purchase soap, hand sanitizer, and personal protective equipment (eg, gloves, masks). Educational materials, in multiple languages, should be disseminated to people who are incarcerated and personnel designated to address any questions or concerns that arise. All corrections staff should receive training on identifying signs of coronavirus and preventing disease transmission. This starts with updating intake forms in detention settings to screen for people who meet criteria for COVID-19 testing and access to rapid (<\u200924 hours) testing results. Partnership with local academic centers to access rapid testing is encouraged. There should be dedicated spaces within jails for isolation of persons with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 who are not ill enough to warrant hospital transfer, with a plan in place for transporting patients when necessary. Ensuring the well-being of law enforcement and correctional officers is key to any mitigation strategy, and there should be policies that compensate staff who become sick with COVID-19.\nFigure 1.\nOpen in new tabDownload slide\nRecommendations to local county jails for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) mitigation response.\nAn evidence-based approach, grounded in public health principles, is needed to contain the outbreak without further isolating an already vulnerable population. The unintended consequences of these mitigation policies must be considered, for example, the deleterious impact of halting mental health treatment programs in jails. The recent riots in Italy\u2019s correctional facilities [12] revealed the potential for negative psychological impact of emergency policies aimed at curtailing the spread of COVID-19 (eg, suspending family visitations). It is time for reexamination of policies, such as cash bail or holding people pretrial (ie, without a conviction), to decrease the jail population [13, 14].\nThoughtful and deliberate planning for COVID-19 mitigation in corrections institutions\u2014especially jails\u2014is imperative. We need action now, starting with engagement of key stakeholders to identify the current and future needs of jails to combat this pandemic. The health of our communities will only be as good, or as poor, as the health of the most disadvantaged among us. Now is the time to prioritize the healthcare of people who are incarcerated.\nNotes\nFinancial support. A. G.

The authors suggest, on an in vitro experiment results basis, an alternative HCQ dose regimen for future clinical trials while several clinical trials on chloroquine (CQ)- and HCQ-based regimens for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are still ongoing [1].\nTaking into account the antiviral in vitro effect, CQ has been considered to be a valuable candidate, alone or in combination with lopinavir, for further testing in animal models or direct off-label use for coronavirus-related diseases [2]. Unfortunately, CQ did not show efficacy in inhibiting viral replication in a mouse SARS-CoV model [3]. Nevertheless, by considering its anti-inflammatory properties, it has been postulated that CQ/HCQ may have some effect on SARS [3, 4]\u2014in particular, by inhibiting the production of proinflammatory cytokines (tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 [TNF-\u03b1], interleukin [IL] 6) and consequently blocking the subsequent cascade of events which leads to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) [4].\nDue to the aforementioned evidence, the negligible cost, its large worldwide use, and the known safety profile, CQ/HCQ has been considered as a potentially useful drug in patients affected by SARS-CoV-2 [1, 5, 6]\nDespite in vitro activity in inhibiting the growth of several viruses, to date no acute virus infection has been successfully treated by CQ/HCQ [7]. Moreover, CQ showed a paradoxical effect when administered in treating Chikungunya virus infection: in a prophylactic study in a nonhuman primate model the infection was enhanced by CQ treatment; in a curative study in a human cohort, CQ did not affect the acute phase of the disease, in term of symptoms and viral clearance, but the chronic complications of Chikungunya were more frequent in the treated group compared with the control group. This paradoxical effect has been explained by a delay in immune adaptive response to the virus provoked by CQ administration that could nullify the antiviral activity shown in vitro [8].\nThe pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 is still unknown; however, preliminary studies have shown differences with respect to SARS pathogenesis. In particular, an initial increase in the secretion of T helper (Th)-2 cytokines (IL-4, IL-10), which suppress inflammation [9], has been shown and which could balance the Th-1 cell hyper-response that is supposed to lead to ARDS in patients affected by SARS [4].\nIt has been demonstrated that CQ inhibits T-cell proliferation by reducing IL-2 production and IL-2 responsiveness [10], and it seems that IL-2 plays a crucial role in \u201cpriming\u201d T cells for Th-2 cell differentiation [11]. Therefore, if Th-2 cell response could play a role in suppressing inflammation in SARS-CoV-2 infection [9], it cannot be excluded that CQ/HCQ negatively impacts the immune response to the virus.\nIn conclusion:\n\u2022\nDespite the in vivo antiviral activity, no acute virus infection has been successfully treated by CQ/HCQ in humans [7];\n\u2022\nCQ/HCQ did not show any anti\u2013SARS-CoV effect in an in vivo model [3]; and\n\u2022\nThe pathogenesis of COVID-19 is still unknown; therefore, the immune effect provoked by CQ/HCQ administration in patients with COVID-19 is unpredictable.\nFor the aforementioned points, CQ/HCQ not only could be useless in treating patients with COVID-19 but may even be harmful, as it was for Chikungunya virus infection. Hence, despite the proven in vitro efficacy, before publication of clinical trial results and/or further clarification about COVID-19 pathogenesis clinicians should use CQ/HCQ cautiously.\nNote\nPotential conflicts of interest.

Here, we report the first case of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)/hepatitis C virus coinfection, who showed a persistently negative SARS-CoV-2 RNA test but delayed antibody response in the plasma. This case highlights the influence of HIV-1\u2013induced immune dysfunction on early SARS-CoV-2 clearance.\nSARS-CoV-2, COVID-19, HIV-1, HCV, antibody\nIssue Section: Brief Report\nIn late December 2019, the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by a novel coronavirus (named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 [SARS-CoV-2]) started in Wuhan, China, and has quickly spread to many countries in the world [1]. Clinical manifestations of COVID-19 have been shown to vary widely, from asymptomatic clinical presentation to acute respiratory distress syndrome [2\u20134]. It remains unknown what host factors may affect the clinical presentation of COVID-19. Our recent studies of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid indicated that monocyte-derived FCN1+ macrophages overwhelmed the severely damaged lungs, while the formation of tissue resident with highly expanded clonal CD8+ T cells in mildly symptomatic patients suggested a robust adaptive immune response associated with better control of COVID-19 (Unpublished data, https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.23.20026690v1). Moreover, a higher titer of antibody in the plasma was independently associated with disease severity in patients with COVID-19 (Unpublished data, https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.28.20028514v2). These data suggest that the host\u2019s immunostatus, to some extent, may affect the outcomes of SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, there is lack of direct evidence for immune influence on the acute infection of SARS-CoV-2. Here, we report a unique case of COVID-19 in a patient with preexisting immune dysfunction from previous coinfection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV), who showed persistently negative SARS-CoV-2 RNA tests but delayed antibody response in the plasma.\nCASE REPORT\nA 38-year-old man was admitted for fever to the Shenzhen Third People\u2019s Hospital in Shenzhen, China, on 25 January 2020. He reported a travel history to Wuhan, China before 16 January 2020, where the outbreak of COVID-19 started. He had repeated fever accompanied by muscle aches since 20 January 2020, without other symptoms such as nasal congestion, runny nose, cough, expectoration, chest tightness, palpitation, or abdominal distension. He was admitted to the hospital with a low fever of 37.2\u00b0C and normal pulse, breath, and blood pressure. Chest computed tomography (CT) showed right lower pneumonia. He was treated with oseltamivir and interferon (IFN)\u2013\u03b1 inhalation. His body temperature rose to 38.3\u00b0C on 26 January 2020. With oral fluid supplementation and physical cooling, his body temperature became normal. On 30 January 2020, he was discharged with the resolution of right lower pneumonia and 3 negative tests for SARS-CoV-2 RNA from nasopharyngeal swabs by the hospital and the Shenzhen Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. During the hospital course, he had normal laboratory tests, including white blood cell counts, lymphocyte counts, and platelets, with the exception of slightly elevated plasma C-reactive protein on 26 January 2020. This study was reviewed and approved by the Medical Ethical Committee of Shenzhen Third People\u2019s Hospital (2020-0110). Written informed consent was obtained from the patient.\nBecause the patient had a history of coinfection with HIV type 1 (HIV-1) and HCV 4 years earlier, on 2 March 2020, 42 days after the onset of his illness, his immune response was evaluated by testing the plasma total antibody (Ab) and immunoglobulin M (IgM) Abs specific for SARS-CoV-2 using chemiluminescence kits supplied by Beijing Wantai Biological Pharmacy Enterprise Co, Ltd, China, according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. The specificity of the assays for total Ab and IgM was determined as 99.1% (211/213) and 98.6% (210/213), respectively, by testing of samples collected from healthy individuals before the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2. This test showed total Ab of 13.2 cut off index (COI) and IgM of 49.5 COI, which were significantly lower and higher, respectively, than those in patients with COVID-19 who had recovered from the illness. At this time, his SARS-CoV-2 RNA test was still negative from nasopharyngeal and anal swabs. Also, RNAs of influenza A and B and respiratory syncytial virus were all negative. One week later, 49 days from the onset of illness, his plasma total Ab rose to 523.8 COI while IgM remained at similar levels with 54 COI (Table 1).\nTable 1.\nEvents and Timeline of the Disease Course in a Patient With COVID-19 and a History of Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type 1/Hepatitis C Virus Coinfection\nEvent/Test Date\n25 Jan 2020 26 Jan 2020 27 Jan 2020 28 Jan 2020 29 Jan 2020 30 Jan 2020 2 Mar 2020 9 Mar 2020\nFever, \u00b0C  37.2  38.3  <37  \u2026  \u2026  \u2026  \u2026  \u2026 \nRight low pneumonia  Yes  Yes  Yes  Yes  Yes  No  \u2026  \u2026 \nOseltamivir  Yes  Yes  Yes  Yes  Yes  No  \u2026  \u2026 \nIFN-\u03b1 inhalation  Yes  Yes  Yes  Yes  Yes  No  \u2026  \u2026 \nNasopharyngeal swabs  \u2026  \u2026  \u2026  \u2026  \u2026  \u2026  \u2026  \u2026 \nAnal swab  \u2026  \u2026  \u2026  \u2026  \u2026  \u2026  \u2026  \u2026 \nWBC counts, \u00d7109/L  2.8  3.1  \u2026  \u2026  \u2026  \u2026  3.77  \u2026 \nLymphocyte, \u00d7109/L  \u2026  1.48  \u2026  \u2026  \u2026  \u2026  1.38  \u2026 \nPlatelet, \u00d71012/L  \u2026  170  \u2026  \u2026  \u2026  \u2026  238  \u2026 \nCRP, mg/L  \u2026  16.6  \u2026  \u2026  \u2026  \u2026  <5  \u2026 \nIgM, COI  \u2026  \u2026  \u2026  \u2026  \u2026  \u2026  49 (4.6 [0.5\u20139.4]a)  54 (1.4 [0.15\u201311.2]b) \nTotal Ab, COI  \u2026  \u2026  \u2026  \u2026  \u2026  \u2026  13.2 (530 [183\u20131190]c)  523.8 (207 [8\u2013812]d) \nCD4 T cells/\u00b5L  \u2026  \u2026  \u2026  \u2026  \u2026  \u2026  216 (250\u2013300e)  250 \nCD8 T cells/\u00b5L  \u2026  \u2026  \u2026  \u2026  \u2026  \u2026  584  701 \nHIV-1 RNA, copies/mL  \u2026  \u2026  \u2026  \u2026  \u2026  \u2026  <500  <500 \nHCV RNA, copies/mL  \u2026  \u2026  \u2026  \u2026  \u2026  \u2026  \u2026  <500 \nAbbreviations: Ab, antibody; COI, cut off index; COVID-19, coronavirus disease 2019; CRP, C-reactive protein; HCV, hepatitis C virus; HIV-1, human immunodeficiency virus type 1; IFN-\u03b1, interferon alpha; IgM, immunoglobulin M; WBC, white blood cell.\naMedian and range of plasma IgM titers in 8 patients who recovered from COVID-19 with similar illness dates.\nbMedian and range of plasma IgM titers in 12 patients who recovered from COVID-19 with similar illness dates.\ncMedian and range of plasma total antibody titers in 8 patients who recovered from COVID-19 with similar illness dates.\ndMedian and range of plasma total antibody titers in 12 patients who recovered from COVID-19 with similar illness dates.\neRange of CD4 T-cell counts in the past 2 years.\nOpen in new tab\nRetrospectively, the patient had been previously coinfected with HIV-1 and HCV through homosexual transmission. Since his diagnosis of HIV-1/HCV coinfection in 2016, when his CD4 T-cell count was 84 cells/\u00b5L, he had been taking lamivudine, tenofovir, and efavirenz until the present time. In 2017, he took antiviral agents against HCV for 3 months, and HCV became persistently negative. During the past 2 years, his CD4 T-cell counts have been fluctuating between 250 and 300 cells/\u00b5L. On 2 March 2020, his CD4 and CD8 T-cell counts in peripheral blood were 216 and 584 cells/\u03bcL, respectively. On 9 March 2020, his CD4 and CD8 T-cell counts were slightly increased, and plasma HIV-1 and HCV both tested negative (Table 1). Since the onset of COVID illness in this patient, his close contact partner, an HIV-1\u2013infected person currently taking lopinavir and ritonavir, tested negative for SARS-CoV-2.\nDISCUSSION\nThis patient had a travel history to Wuhan, the epicenter of COVID-19, and displayed the clinical presentation of COVID-19, such as fever and typical pneumonia on CT. Although the SARS-CoV-2 RNA test was persistently negative on different specimen samplings at various times, plasma anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody was positive, which, together with the typical clinical presentation, confirmed the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The reasons/mechanisms underlying the undetectable RNA of SARS-CoV-2 in this case are unclear. One potential explanation is that he was taking anti-HIV-1 agents that have been reported to have anti-SARS-CoV-2 effects [5]. His close contact partner with HIV-1 infection, who was also taking anti-HIV agents, also tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. These data are consistent with the notion that some anti-HIV-1 agents may have preventive and/or therapeutic effects against SARS-CoV-2. Another possibility is that the activated type I IFN may help suppress SARS-CoV-2. A previous study has shown that HIV-1 infection may induce high levels of type I IFN [6], which may to some extent clear SARS-CoV-2 infection, thus leading to persistently undetectable RNA. Future studies are needed to prove these possibilities.\nNotably, the SARS-CoV-2\u2013specific total antibody titer was low, and IgM was high even after 42 days of illness, which was significantly different from antibody levels in other patients who have recovered from COVID-19 at similar time points of the illness. Importantly, the total Ab level was largely increased, and IgM remained at the peak level 1 week later, suggesting that the antibody responses against SARS-CoV-2 in this HIV-1\u2013infected case were delayed. It is possible that there was early incomplete clearance of the virus that induced the subsequently delayed antibody response. Future studies are needed to address the mechanism underlying this delayed antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 with a history of coinfection of HIV-1 infection and HCV, even with the latter being cleared in this case.\nIn summary, we report for the first time a case of COVID-19 in a patient with a history of coinfection of HIV-1 and HCV who showed delayed antibody response. This case highlights the possible influence of HIV-1\u2013induced immune dysfunction on the immune responses to and clearance of SARS-CoV-2.\nNotes\nAcknowledgments.

A neighbor stops talking with a family next door because they are originally from France. A patient tells me that coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was manufactured as a weapon of bioterrorism. These are real stories that have happened before the massive school closures and the travel restrictions. As the spread of COVID-19 increases, I find myself pausing to think: could stigma, discrimination, and misinformation decrease our ability to have an effective response to this pandemic? What makes this novel virus susceptible to conspiracy theories? And what can we do to collectively to fight against stigma and have a unified response, not only in the United States but globally?\nThe origin of COVID-19 remains unclear. One hypothesis is that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus that causes COVID-19, arose from a cross-species transmission from an animal reservoir (likely bats) and may have involved an intermediary animal host before infecting humans [1, 2]. COVID-19 has a few characteristics that make it particularly attractive to conspiracies: (1) it appeared suddenly and spread rapidly, (2) its origin remains a mystery, (3) it has a relatively high case fatality rate with a rate 5 to 35 times higher than that of influenza, and (4) there are no vaccines and no therapeutics [3]. To make sense of this rapidly evolving pandemic, the Internet is filled with alternative facts that bring social value to a biological mechanism.\nTo date, COVID-19 has spread across all continents and claimed 25\u2005250 lives [4]. Among the sick, we can only offset the biological damage from the virus by using supportive measures with very little control since we currently do not have a cure. However, what we do have control over is our own behavior. Applying social distancing [5] is key, but relying on factual information to guide public health decisions is also important. Learning from the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) epidemic we know that communities can contribute to the reinforcement of stigma or we can work actively to break down barriers and together create solutions that can benefit all. We also learned that stigma can be as fatal as the disease itself [6]. This pandemic will pass, what will stay is the damage created by labeling people who are foreign as dangerous, by putting ourselves first and others last, and by having a very narrow scope of our sense of responsibility in the response to this pandemic. Now is not the time to have this \u201cus against them mentality.\u201d There can be strength in cross-collaboration at all levels to resolve this pandemic. Even in the setting of social distancing, families and communities can remain strong by staying virtually connected and by being creative around problem solving to make provision for food, shelter, and child care. But our sense of duty doesn\u2019t need to stop with us. Globally, there is a need to create an environment for shared learning regardless of ideology. This is necessary to inform public health responses but also to share knowledge and resources for the development of vaccines and therapeutics. As COVID-19 continues to spread to now also affect low-resource countries that, under regular circumstances, have very limited capacity for intensive care, I hope that we will not repeat the mistakes of the past as seen with the HIV epidemic where life-saving drugs were only available in high-resource countries, leaving impoverished nations with limited or no access to life-sustaining therapies. COVID-19 is not an Asian problem, it\u2019s not a European or even an American problem. It\u2019s a global problem that involves each of us and we should all be invested in coming up with solutions for ourselves, our neighbors, and for the world.\nNote\nPotential conflicts of interest.

However, the problem of COVID-19 is that around 70%\u201380% of patients do not have productive cough [1]. To protect healthcare workers during sampling for diagnosis, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends not inducing cough to collect sputum samples, but rather the collection of nasopharyngeal and/or oropharyngeal swabs, or nasopharyngeal wash/aspirate or nasal aspirate. Nasal swabs are reported to have higher viral titers than throat swabs [2]; accordingly, nasopharyngeal swabs are the preferred samples in Japan. However, nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs cause discomfort to patients and can potentially increase the risk of direct exposure of healthcare workers by provoking coughing. Moreover, the sensitivity for virus detection is low with these swabs; viral load is reportedly higher in sputum samples [3].\nHere we report a case in which gargle lavage samples yielded a positive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) result. A 55-year-old man came to our hospital complaining of 5 days of fever (maximum 38.6\u00b0C). He had a mild headache, but no respiratory symptoms. Four days prior to his fever, he had had contact with a COVID-19 infection cluster. On admission, his vital signs were within the normal range and his breathing sounds were normal. His blood tests on admission (day 6) revealed mild lymphocytopenia (720 cells/\u03bcL) and slightly elevated C-reactive protein (0.88 mg/dL). Although his chest radiograph was not remarkable, his computed tomographic scan revealed patchy ground-glass opacities predominantly in the left lower lobe (Supplementary Figures 1 and 2). Samples were taken to test for COVID-19 by real-time reverse-transcription PCR, using primers recommended by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention [4]. Oropharyngeal swabs and gargle lavage (using 10 mL of normal saline) were collected because he did not produce sputum. Additional gargle lavage samples and oropharyngeal swabs were collected and tested on days 8 and 9 and found to be positive, with a slightly higher amount of viral genome in the gargle lavage sample (Supplementary Figure 3). His PCR became negative on day 16 and 19, and he was discharged on day 19.\nFor other respiratory pathogens, gargle lavage samples have been reported to be more sensitive than throat swabs [5]. Gargle lavage can be done by patients themselves without putting healthcare professionals at increased risk, which is reportedly high in this outbreak [1]. Gargle lavage thus offers a safer and possibly more sensitive alternative or additional option for diagnosing COVID-19.\nSupplementary Data\nSupplementary materials are available at Clinical Infectious Diseases online.

There is a critical lack of predictive factors that can guide clinicians in identifying patients at risk for prolonged, and thus potentially more severe, COVID-19 that needs an early and aggressive therapeutic approach. This fact has prompted Mo and colleagues [1] to retrospectively characterize patients with refractory COVID-19 as compared with patients with nonrefractory COVID-19 (termed \u201cgeneral COVID-19\u201d). The authors reported that patients classified as refractory COVID-19 were more likely to be older, of male sex, have underlying comorbidities, be afebrile, have shortness of breath and anorexia, and to have laboratory abnormalities and radiological changes. In addition, patients with refractory COVID-19 were more likely to receive oxygen, mechanical ventilation, expectorant, adjunctive treatment including corticosteroids, antiviral drugs, and immune enhancers when compared with patients with general COVID-19. The authors have further attempted to explore predictive factors for refractory COVID-19 using a multivariate analysis showing that male sex, anorexia on admission, and being afebrile are independent risk factors for the development of a refractory disease. Furthermore, from this analysis the authors have found that patients with refractory COVID-19 were more likely to receive oxygen, expectorant, corticosteroids, lopinavir/ritonavir, and immune enhancers.\nIn their paper, the authors compared categorical and continuous variables between the 2 groups of patients and these variables that differed significantly between the 2 groups were included in the multivariate regression analysis. In addition to comparing the frequencies by \u03c7\u200a2 test and continuous data by nonparametric comparative test, it is well accepted to perform a univariate regression analysis assessing the different variables and their association with the outcome of interest (ie, refractory vs general COVID-19) and report their odds ratio (OR) with a measure of variance (eg, 95% confidence interval). Based on such univariate regression analysis, authors can determine the variables to be included in the multivariate logistic regression model to assess independent variables associated with the outcome and their estimated adjusted ORs [2,3].\nIn their paper, the authors included the treatment introduced at the time of patient admission and/or hospitalization in the multivariate analysis aiming to identify independent risk factors for refractory COVID-19. One potential concern is that patients who are sicker at the time of admission or during hospitalization are more likely to need oxygen and receive expectorant, corticosteroids, and antiviral and immune enhancers and thus are more likely to have refractory COVID-19 as compared with general COVID-19. Including these variables might potentially have affected the results. The authors should have included in their multivariate model only baseline and clinical characteristics and laboratory results at admission to accurately identify independent risk factors associated with refractory COVID-19.\nGiven the unusual and unprecedented circumstances our clinical community is experiencing, integrating the aforementioned information in the article by Mo and colleagues will provide scientific evidence to help physicians and healthcare providers across the world tackle the escalating COVID-19 pandemic as best as they can.\nNotes\nFinancial Disclosure.

The vulnerability that we are experiencing during the current severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 pandemic was eloquently described by Camus while the plague devastated the Algerian town. Similarly, the current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic\u2014the third introduction of a highly pathogenic coronavirus into human populations in the 21st century\u2014has caused an incalculable human toll in many settings and disrupted the global economy. Approximately 185 countries have reported cases, with 1\u2009991\u2009562 confirmed cases and 130\u2009885 deaths worldwide as of 16 April 2020 [2]. In the midst of this pandemic, the commitment, empathy, and human spirit of every single healthcare provider is a major source of inspiration and pride.\nOver the last few weeks, roaming through the intensive care units reveals recurrent and monotonous scenes of sorrow and confusion, recalling the images printed in medical school textbooks of line after line of iron lungs for paralyzed children during poliomyelitis epidemics in the 1950s. Except, now, only adults are part of this large collective wreckage in human history. The relentless determination and compassion of nurses, intensivists, respiratory therapists, and other healthcare workers is only countered by the loneliness of patients without their loved ones at their side.\nPandemics represent the most dramatic presentation of the rapid and effective spread of infectious pathogens such as bacteria or a virus acting as the wildcards of world\u2019s history. The cost in human lives is only rivaled to the resulting social breakdown, disruption of business, and widespread panic. Camus\u2019s narrative reveals our contemporaneous familiarity with the concept of how our lives and our sorrows become instantly meaningless in the face of an epidemic that spreads rapidly and unexpectedly, inconveniently interrupting our daily routines. But more than anything, Camus reminds us that we can never be mentally or fully prepared for pandemics. The gifts of the Enlightenment and the advances of civilization are pointless when a pandemic removes the safety bumpers of our lives. Suffering becomes randomly distributed, causing everyone to aspire escaping the fates of an unfortunate destiny.\nIn Camus\u2019s tale, which is by many considered the best European novel of the postwar period, the narrator, Dr Bernard Rieux, works tirelessly to reduce the suffering of the inhabitants of Oran. In one of the passages, Dr Rieux states, \u201cThe whole thing is not about heroism\u2026. It may seem a ridiculous idea, but the only way to fight the plague is with decency.\u201d For Dr Rieux, decency meant doing his job in relieving human suffering during the health crisis and the piling number of dead bodies caused by the relentless Black Death.\nAlbert Camus\u2019s story reminds us of the enormous respect and admiration of the human spirit when a plague such as COVID-19 befalls us. There are many modern versions of Dr Rieux who have cared with the utmost professionalism and decency for those severely afflicted by this modern plague.\nNote\nPotential conflicts of interest.

We reported the effectiveness of different responses of 4 affected cities in preventing the COVID-19 spread. We expect the Wenzhou anti\u2013COVID-19 measures may provide information for cities around the world that are experiencing this epidemic.\nCOVID19, measures, treatment, outbreak, epidemic\nIssue Section: Brief Report\nAn outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by a novel coronavirus (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 [SARS-CoV-2]) that emerged in Wuhan, China, in December 2019 [1, 2] was declared by the World Health Organization as a \u201cPublic Health Emergency of International Concern\u201d on 30 January 2020. To date (27 March 2020), COVID-19 has spread globally, including China and 200 other countries and territories, with a total of 509 164 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases [3]. As COVID-19 thus poses a great threat to global public health, determining how to prevent the spread is of paramount importance.\nWenzhou, a coastal city in southern China with a resident population of 9.25 million, was the most heavily affected with respect to COVID-19 infections outside of Hubei Province. This is the result of the more than 90\u2005000 people who returned to Wenzhou from Wuhan during this Lunar New Year (around January 25). Here, we compared the effectiveness of the different responses of 4 affected cities in preventing a COVID-19 epidemic.\nThe epidemic data (confirmed and new cases) from 17 January to 13 March 2020 were obtained from the database of Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and Wenzhou municipal CDCs. The cities examined in this study\u2014Wenzhou in Zhejiang Province and Jingzhou, Xiaogan, and Huanggang (neighboring cities of Wuhan) in Hubei Province\u2014are similar in size and population as well as in their number of confirmed and new cases of COVID-19.\nOn 17 January, when the first case of COVID-19 was confirmed, the Wenzhou New Coronavirus Pneumonia Prevention and Control Committee launched emergency epidemic prevention and control measures, which, in general, consisted of 2 phases.\nWenzhou\u2019s first-phase prevention and control measures (first-phase measures) were moderate preventive measures undertaken from 17 to 30 January 2020. The main measures included (1) centralizing the confirmed and suspected patients in designated hospitals for treatment, (2) identifying and investigating all returnees from Wuhan using a big-data network and persuading them to undergo 14-day home quarantine, and (3) centralizing and medically observing individuals who had been exposed to a patient with confirmed COVID-19.\nWenzhou\u2019s second-phase prevention and control measures (second-phase measures, also called \u201cWenzhou anti\u2013COVID-19 measures\u201d) consisted of extremely aggressive social distancing and quarantining measures and were carried out from 31 January to 20 February 2020. The measures were referred to as \u201c25 emergency measures for Wenzhou epidemic prevention and control\u201d and mainly focused on pinpointing the infection source and completely cutting off any transmission routes. The measures are summarized as follows:\nShutdown of the city. All traffic in and around Wenzhou, including airports, high-speed rail stations, and bus stations, was cut off. Only 5 access points to the expressway were open for transportation of prevention and control materials and necessities, and these were under strict monitoring.\nLockdown of communities. All places of public gatherings were shut down, including malls, public entertainment facilities, group meetings, restaurants, and hotels. The committee enforced crowd-grid management using communities and villages as individual units; inspection stations were set up in major locations, and all entrants were interviewed and registered, with body temperature monitoring. In addition, all individuals were required to stay at home, and daily necessities were delivered in real time.\nTracking and inspection. A combination of mobile big data, network searches, screening at city entrances, etc, was used to track and investigate individuals at risk of infection in a timely manner. All COVID-19 contacts and suspected patients were isolated for quarantining. The confirmed cases were rapidly transferred to designated hospitals for treatment.\nIntensive care. All patients with critically severe COVID-19 were transferred to the First Affiliated Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University for intensive care, whereas the mild cases and suspected patients were treated at designated medical centers in the city. The intensive care of patients with COVID-19 was conducted under the guidance of a team of medical experts, which included an epidemiologist. All of the close contacts of each confirmed patient were isolated and underwent medical observation. Meanwhile, a rapid nucleic acid detection kit for COVID-19 was used as soon as possible for the diagnosis and to make quarantine and treatment decisions.\nThe epidemic growth rate was estimated by analyzing number of the confirmed cases from 21 January to 3 March 2020. The COVID-19 transmission model in Wenzhou was established using the data-driven network modeling analysis methods [4]. Statistical analyses were performed using Matlab version R2018a software (The MathWorks, Inc).\nAs of 17 February 2020 (when the last case was confirmed), 504 COVID-19 cases had been reported in Wenzhou. Of these patients, 208 (41.3%) were originally infected outside of the city (imported cases from other cities) and 296 (58.7%) had been infected locally (local cases).\nModerate measures (first-phase measures) were executed from 17 to 30 January in Wenzhou. However, as of 31 January 2020, 246 cases had been reported, of which 180 (73.2%) were imported and 66 (26.8%) were local. The epidemic pattern in Wenzhou showed that COVID-19 mainly spread in the city (social outbreaks). Therefore, the second-phase measures were implemented on 31 January 2020. A total of 258 cases have been reported from 1 February to 3 March, of which 37 (14.3%) were imported and 221 (85.7%) were local. The new cases were predominantly reported in 5 counties (Yueqing, Ruian, Yongjia, Wencheng, and Taishun) in the Wenzhou area. Importantly, two-thirds of these cases were family-type onset. Therefore, the Wenzhou anti\u2013COVID-19 measures changed the epidemic from social outbreaks to family-type onset.\nAfter the implementation of the first-phase measures in Wenzhou, the imported cases from other cities were substantially reduced. However, the outbreak in the city remained, suggesting that the transmission routes were not completely blocked. To prevent further spread, the Wenzhou New Coronavirus Pneumonia Prevention and Control Committee launched \u201cTwenty-Five Emergency Measures\u201d (Wenzhou\u2019s anti\u2013COVID-19 measures) on 31 January. As a result, the number of new cases quickly dropped, and no new and confirmed cases were reported after 17 February. The epidemic was under control in 31 days (from 17 January to 17 February).\nThe implementation of the first-phase measures significantly reduced the incidence of imported cases from other cities, suggesting that these measures were effective for import prevention, but did not block the COVID-19 outbreak in the city. Moderate preventive measures were also implemented in Huanggang, Xiaogan, and Jingzhou, cities in the region surrounding Wuhan. The COVID-19 onset time and populations in these 3 cities were similar to those in Wenzhou, and thus the epidemic was occurring in parallel (Figure 1A). However, after 31 January, the incidence curves in the 4 cities were notably different. Subsequent outbreaks were observed in Huanggang, Xiaogan, and Jingzhou but not in Wenzhou. However, the numbers of new cases in these cities were meaningfully reduced after implementation of very aggressive social distancing and quarantining measures, which were similar to Wenzhou\u2019s second-phase measures on 10 February (Figure 1A). These data suggest that the Wenzhou anti\u2013COVID-19 measures were effective in controlling the spread of COVID-19.\nFigure 1.\nOpen in new tabDownload slide\nThe epidemic pattern after implementation of different anti\u2013COVID-19 responses.

Three basic reproduction numbers (R0) were estimated with 3 stages (first stage: 4\u201323 January; second stage: 23\u201331 January; third stage: 31 January to 3 March) to evaluate the effect of Wenzhou\u2019s first- and second-phase measures on the epidemic. Abbreviation: COVID-19, coronavirus disease 2019.\nOf the 504 patients in Wenzhou, 434 patients had mild disease, and 62 had severe disease, and 8 had critically severe disease; 502 patients had been discharged and 1 patient (0.2% mortality) had died, and 1 patient was still in critical condition. A total of 268 patients (53.2%) were male, and the median patient age was 47 years (range, 2\u201393 years). The average time to diagnosis for the patients was 5.5 days (range, 1\u201321 days). The cure rate of COVID-19 (99.6%; 502/504) in Wenzhou was higher than that nationwide (79.3%; 64\u2005111/80\u2005813), in Wuhan (70.4%; 35\u2005197/49\u2005991), in Huanggang (93.5%; 2720/2907), in Jingzhou (92.6%; 1464/1580), and in Xiaogan (91.1%; 3204/3518). No healthcare workers were infected in Wenzhou. As of 13 March, 80\u2005270 new cases have been diagnosed in China, with a case fatality rate of 3.9% (3176/80\u2005813) [5]. The case fatality rate was 4.5% (3062/67\u2005786) in Hubei, 4.9% (2436/49\u2005991) in Wuhan, 4.2% (125/2907) in Huanggang, 3.1% (49/1580) in Jingzhou, 3.5% (126/3518) in Xiaogan, and 0.87% (114/13\u2005027) in regions outside of Hubei province [5]. The case fatality rate in Wenzhou was 0.2%, which was substantially lower than that in Wuhan and other regions in China [6].\nA comparative analysis was conducted in 4 cities. The incidence curves in these cities were very similar before 31 January. Wenzhou\u2019s first incidence peak appeared on 29 January, and then declined steadily. No second peak was found thereafter. However, Huanggang, Xiaogan, and Jingzhou all had their second and even third incidence peaks after 31 January (Figure 1B). These 3 cities implemented rigorous measures that were similar to the Wenzhou anti\u2013COVID-19 measures on 10, 14, and 15 February, respectively. As a result, the outbreak of COVID-19 in these 3 cities was gradually controlled.\nThe basic reproduction number or R0 value was 2.6193 for the COVID-19 outbreak in Wenzhou during the early stage of the epidemic (Figure 1C), meaning that, on average, each patient has spread the infection to 2.6 other people, which is consistent with the reports in the literature. For example, Wu et al [7] reported an R0 value of 2.68 (95% confidence interval [CI], 2.47\u20132.86), Li et al [2] reported an R0 value of 2.2 (95% CI, 1.4\u20133.9), and Read et al [8] reported an R0 value of 3.11 (95% CI, 2.39\u20134.13), suggesting that COVID-19 is very contagious. In general, an epidemic will increase as long as R0 is greater than 1, and control measures should be developed to make R0 dropped below 1. The R0 of SARS has been estimated to be approximately 3 [9] and SARS outbreaks have been successfully controlled by isolation of patients and careful infection control [10]. Therefore, Wenzhou anti\u2013COVID-19 measures represented an extremely rapid response in the COVID-19 crisis.\nThese data suggest that the very aggressive social distancing and quarantining measures (Wenzhou\u2019s anti\u2013COVID-19 measures) in the second phase were effective in controlling the spread of COVID-19. Wenzhou\u2019s anti\u2013COVID-19 measures may provide valuable guidance for other cities around the world that are experiencing this epidemic.\nNotes\nFinancial support.

It is still unclear how fast the virus evolved and how it interacts with other microorganisms in the lung.\nMethods\nWe have conducted metatranscriptome sequencing for bronchoalveolar lavage fluid samples from 8 patients with SARS\u2013CoV-2, and also analyzed data from 25 patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), and 20 healthy controls for comparison.\nResults\nThe median number of intrahost variants was 1\u20134 in SARS\u2013CoV-2\u2013infected patients, ranged from 0 to 51 in different samples. The distribution of variants on genes was similar to those observed in the population data. However, very few intrahost variants were observed in the population as polymorphisms, implying either a bottleneck or purifying selection involved in the transmission of the virus, or a consequence of the limited diversity represented in the current polymorphism data. Although current evidence did not support the transmission of intrahost variants in a possible person-to-person spread, the risk should not be overlooked. Microbiotas in SARS\u2013CoV-2\u2013infected patients were similar to those in CAP, either dominated by the pathogens or with elevated levels of oral and upper respiratory commensal bacteria.\nConclusion\nSARS\u2013CoV-2 evolves in vivo after infection, which may affect its virulence, infectivity, and transmissibility. Although how the intrahost variant spreads in the population is still elusive, it is necessary to strengthen the surveillance of the viral evolution in the population and associated clinical changes.\nSARS, CoV-2, COVID-19, intrahost variant, microbiota, transmission\nTopic: genome viruses microbiome sars-cov-2 covid-19\nIssue Section: Major Article\nSince the outbreak of a novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)\u2013 coronavirus (CoV) 2, in Wuhan, China, the virus had spread to >20 countries, resulting in >75\u2005000 cases and >2300 deaths (until 22 February 2020) [1, 2]. The basic reproduction number was estimated to range from 2.2 to 3.5 at the early stage [3], making it a severe threat to public health. Recent studies have identified bats as the possible origin of SARS\u2013CoV-2, and the virus likely uses the same cell surface receptor as SARS\u2013CoV [4], namely, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2. These studies have advanced our understanding of SARS\u2013CoV-2. However, our knowledge of this virus is still limited.\nThe virus undergoes a strong immunologic pressure in humans, and it may thus accumulate mutations to outmaneuver the immune system [5]. These mutations could result in changes in viral virulence, infectivity, and transmissibility [6]. Therefore, it is imperative to investigate the pattern and frequency of mutations occurred. Aside from the pathogen, the lung microbiota is associated with disease susceptibility and severity [7]. Alterations in lung microbiota could potentially modify immune response against the viral and secondary bacterial infection [8, 9]. Thus, understanding the microbiota, which comprises bacteria that could cause secondary infection or exert effects on the mucosal immune system, might help predict the outcome and reduce complications.\nIn the current study, we conducted metatranscriptome sequencing on bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) samples from 8 patients with CoV disease 2019 (COVID-19, the disease caused by SARS\u2013CoV-2). We found that the number of intrahost variants ranged from 0 to 51 with a median number of 4, suggesting a high evolution rate of the virus. By investigating a possible person-to-person spread event, we found no evidence for the transmission of intrahost variants. Meanwhile, we found no specific microbiota alteration in BALF samples from patients with COVID-19, compared with patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) with other suspected viral causes.\nMETHODS\nPatients, Controls, and Sample Collection\nEight COVID-19 pneumonia samples were collected from hospitals in Wuhan on January 2020; 25 viruslike CAP samples were collected from Beijing Peking University People\u2019s Hospital, the Shenzhen Third People\u2019s Hospital, Fujian Provincial Hospital, and the First Affiliated Hospital of Xi\u2019an Jiaotong University between 2014 and 2018. CAP was diagnosed following the guidelines of the Infectious Diseases Society of America and the American Thoracic Society [10]. Patients with pneumonia who have chronic pulmonary diseases were excluded. Meanwhile, BALF samples from 20 healthy volunteers were collected and used as healthy controls. Demographic information and clinical information were included in Supplementary Table 1.\nFor each patient, BALF samples were collected using a bronchoscope as part of normal clinical management. The volume of the samples ranged from 5\u2005to 30\u2005mL; most were used for bacterial culture, and the rest were aliquoted and stored at \u201280\u00baC before processing.\nMetatranscriptome Sequencing\nA 200-\u03bcL aliquot of each SARS\u2013CoV-2\u2013infected whole-BALF sample was used to extract RNA, using a Direct-zol RNA Miniprep kit (Zymo Research) and Trizol LS (Thermo Fisher Scientific) in a biosafety level 3 laboratory, and the rest of the samples were treated according to the same protocol in a biosafety level 2 laboratory. The RNA was then reverse-transcribed, amplified using an Ovation Trio RNA-Seq library preparation kit (NuGEN). and was sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq 2500/4000 platform (Illumina).\nData Availability\nThe viral sequencing data reported in this article have been deposited in the Genome Warehouse in the National Genomics Data Center [11] (under project PRJCA002202, publicly accessible at https://bigd.big.ac.cn/gsa). Meanwhile, the data have also been submitted to the National Center for Biotechnology Information Sequence Read Archive database (project PRJNA605907). The data of CAP and healthy controls was kindly shared by our collaborators, the microbiota composition data is available from the corresponding author on request.\nData Processing and Taxonomic Assignments\nQuality control processes included adapter trimming, low-quality reads removal, and short reads removal with fastp software (-l 70, -x, -cut-tail, -cut_tail_mean_quality 20; version 0.20.0) [12], low-complexity reads removal with Komplexity software (-F, -k 8, -t 0.2; version November 2019) [13], host removal with bmtagger software (ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/agarwala/bmtagger) [14], and ribosomal reads removal with SortMeRNA software (version 2.1b) [15].\nThe resultant reads were mapped against the National Center for Biotechnology Information nucleotide database (version 1 July 2019) using BLAST+ software\u2005(version 2.9.0) (-task megablast, -evalue 1 \u00d7 10-10, -max_target_seqs 10, -max_hsps 1, -qcov_hsp_perc 60, -perc_identity 60) [16]. Taxonomic assignment was done with MEGAN software (version 6.11.0), using a lowest-common-ancestor algorithm (-ms 100, -supp 0, -me 0.01, -top 10, -mrc 60) [17]. After an overall principal coordinates analysis and permutational multivariate analysis of variance, samples and microorganisms were filtered for further analyses. Samples with <5000 microbial reads were discarded. Microorganisms satisfying the following criteria were considered in the microbiota analysis: (1) archaea, bacteria, fungi, or virus; (2) relative abundance\u2005\u22651% in the raw data and filtered data; (3) support by \u2265100 reads; (4) abundance >10-fold that in the negative control (NC); (5) no batch effect; (6) abundance not negatively correlated with bacteria titer; and (7) no known contamination.\nDetection of Intraindividual Variants\nClean reads were mapped to the reference genome of SARS\u2013CoV-2 (GenBank MN908947.3), using BWA mem software (version 0.7.12) [18]. Duplicate reads were removed using Picard software (http://broadinstitute.github.io/picard; version 2.18.22). The mpileup file was generated using samtools software (version 1.8) [19], and intrahost variants were identified using VarScan software (version 2.3.9) [20] and in-house scripts.\nAll variants had to satisfy the following requirements: (1) sequencing depth\u2005\u226550, (2) minor allele frequency (MAF)\u2005\u22655%, (3) MAF\u22652% on each strand, (4) minor allele count\u2005\u22655 on each strand, (5) minor allele supported by the inner part of the read (excluding 10\u2005base pairs on each end), and (6) both alleles identified in \u22653 reads that specifically mapped to the genome of Betacoronavirus. For comparison with the polymorphism in the population, we obtained 110 sequences from the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID) (www.gisaid.org) [21, 22]. The accession numbers and acknowledgments are included in Supplementary Table 2.\nStatistical Analysis\nPearson \u00d7\u200a2 or Fisher exact tests were used for categorical variables, and Mann-Whitney U or Kruskal-Wallis rank sum tests for continuous variables that do not follow a normal distribution. Microbiotas were compared using permutational multivariate analysis of variance.\nEthical Approval and Consents\nThis study was approved by the National Health Commission of China and Ethics Commission of the Jin Yin-tan Hospital of Wuhan (No. KY-2020-01.01). The requirement for written informed consent was waived given the context of emerging infectious diseases. The study of the CAP and healthy controls was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the Institute of Pathogen Biology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College (IPB-2018-3). Written informed consent was obtained from all pneumonia patients and healthy controls.\nRESULTS\nData Summary\nBy metatranscriptome sequencing, >20 million reads were generated for each BALF sample from patients with COVID-19 (nCoV) as well as an NC (nuclease-free water). For comparison, the metatranscriptome sequencing data with similar number of reads from 25 patients with viruslike CAP (determined by \u2265100 viral reads and 10-fold higher than those in the NC), 20 healthy controls without any known pulmonary diseases, and 2 extra NCs (2 saline solutions passing through the bronchoscope) were used in this study. Demographic and clinical information was collected and is summarized in Supplementary Table 1.\nAfter quality control, a median number of 55\u2005571 microbial reads was generated for each sample. nCoV samples had the highest proportion of microbial reads (median proportion, 7% for nCoV vs 0.8% for CAP and 0.1% for healthy controls; P\u2005<\u2005.001) (Figure 1A), and 49% of the total number of microbial reads could be mapped to SARS\u2013CoV-2, which did not differ from the viral proportion in CAP (Figure 1B). SARS-CoV-2 was the only Betacoronavirus identified in nCoV samples. Moreover, besides the detection of human coronavirus OC43 (HCoV-OC43) in 1 healthy control and human coronavirus HKU1 (HCoV-HKU1) in 1 patient with CAP, no other samples showed any signal of Betacoronavirus, which proved the authenticity of the data and methods used in our analysis.\nFigure 1.\nOpen in new tabDownload slide\nOverview of sequencing data.

In total, 84 intrahost variants were identified with MAF >5%, and 25 with MAF >20% (Supplementary Table 4 and Figure 2B); the sample from patient nCoV5 was excluded from the analysis owing to large gaps in its genome coverage.\nFigure 2.\nOpen in new tabDownload slide\nIntrahost variants in the severe acute respiratory syndrome\u2013coronavirus 2 (SARS\u2013CoV-2) genome.

C, Distribution of the intrahost variations and polymorphisms on the SARS\u2013CoV-2 genome. The outer ring displays the structure of the genome, followed by the distribution of polymorphisms on the genome. The length of each line represents the number of sequences with this mutation. Owing to a large variation in the number (1\u201327), 5% of the line length was added for each additional sequence. Inner rings represent the distribution of intrahost variants in different patients (rings are labeled with patient numbers). Red bars indicate synonymous mutations; blue bars, nonsynonymous mutations. D, Frequency of the mutant allele at each high-level (frequency\u2005\u226520%) intrahost variant position. Nucleotides at the position (reference allele/alternative allele), mutation type (nonsynonymous, synonymous, noncoding), gene name, amino acid change are shown to the right of the heat map, and the total number of variants (with frequency\u2005\u226520%) in each sample is shown above it. The patient/sample numbers for the 5 samples with >80% of the genome covered by \u226550-fold are highlighted in blue. Open circles represent samples with a sequencing depth <50-fold at this position.\nNotably, the number of variants was not associated with the sequencing depth (Supplementary Figure 1). The overall Ka/Ks ratio (The ratio of the rate of nonsynonymous mutations to the rate of synonymous mutations) was significantly smaller than 1, which was similar for intrahost variants and the polymorphisms observed in the population data, suggesting a purifying selection acting on both types of mutations (Table 1). The numbers of variants observed in the gene were proportional to gene lengths (correlation between the gene length and the number of mutations in the gene,\u20050.950 for the intrahost variant and\u20050.957 for the polymorphisms; both P\u2005< .001). Although only a small fraction of the variants were observed in multiple patients (2 of 84 variants; Figure 2C), some positions were more prone to mutate or variants were transmitting in the population, such as position 10\u2005779, where the mutant allele A was observed in all 7 patients, with frequencies ranging from 15% to 100% (Figure 2D).\nTable 1.\nThe Number of Intrahost Variants and Polymorphisms in the Genome of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome\u2013Coronavirus 2\nGene Gene Length (Base Pairs) Intrahost Variants Polymorphisms\nNS S Ka/Ksa NS S Ka/Ks P Valueb\norf1a  13\u2005203  30  9  0.676  34  14  0.493c  .63 \norf1b  8088  8  5  0.355  10  8  0.277c  >.99 \nS  3822  8  3  0.599  10  6  0.375  .69 \nORF3a  828  2  1  0.561  4  2  0.561  >.99 \nE  228  0  0  NA  0  0  NA  >.99 \nM  669  2  0  NA  1  1  0.318  >.99 \nORF6  186  1  0  NA  0  0  NA  >.99 \nORF7a  366  2  0  NA  3  0  NA  >.99 \nORF8  366  2  2  0.228  2  1  0.456  >.99 \nN  1260  7  2  1.048  5  7  0.214c  .18 \nORF10  117  0  0  NA  1  0  NA  >.99 \nTotal  29\u2005133  62  22  0.578c  70  39  0.368c  .16 \nAbbreviation: NA, not applicable.\naKa/Ks ratios (the ratio of the rate of nonsynonymous mutations to the rate of synonymous mutations) were calculated using KaKs_Calculator2.0 software (MS model) [23].\nbSignificance of difference between Ka/Ks ratios for 2 types of mutation in the gene (Fisher exact test).\ncKa/Ks differs significantly from 1 (P\u2005<\u2005.05).\nOpen in new tab\nThe number of intrahost variants per individual showed a large variation (0\u201351 [median, 4] vs 0\u201319 [median, 1] for variants with MAF\u2005\u22655% vs MAF\u2005\u226520%), which could not be explained by the batch effect, coverage variance, or contamination (Supplementary Figure 1) (samples from patients nCoV1\u20134 were in one batch, with nCoV5\u20138 in another; most mutations were not observed in the population data). We also noted that the number of variations was not relevant to the days after symptom onset or the age of patients (Supplementary Figure 2). Collectively, we did not find any reason for the high level of variants in the sample from patient nCoV6 (51 variants). A larger population size is needed to investigate how frequent such outliers are, and whether they are associated with the level of host immune response or the viral replication rate. We also noted similar outliers for other viruses [24]. Of note, the origin of variants could be either mutation occurring in vivo after infection or multiple transmitted SARS\u2013CoV-2 strains.\nNo Evidence for Transmission of Intrahost Variants Between Samples\nAmong the 8 patients with COVID-19, patients nCoV4 and nCoV7 were from the same household, with dates of symptom onset differing by 5 days; thus, transmission from patient nCoV4 to patient nCoV7 is highly suspected, especially considering that only patient nCoV4 had been to the Huanan seafood market in Wuhan, the starting point of the outbreak and the suspected source. First, the consensus sequence of the virus was the same for 2 samples, and none of the 4 intrahost variants meeting the selection criteria in patient nCoV4 were detected in patient nCoV7 (Table 2). We further expanded the investigation to all variants with MAF\u2005\u22652% and supported by \u22653 reads. By doing so, we detected 7 variants (of 25) shared between the 2 samples. However, the MAF in both patients nCoV4 and nCoV7 were similar to those in other samples, suggesting that these positions were either error prone or mutation prone; hence, they cannot support the transmission of these variants.\nTable 2.\nAllele Frequency Changes in Transmission of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome\u2013Coronavirus 2 From Patient nCoV4 to Patient nCoV7\nPosition Patient nCoV4 Patient nCoV7 P Valuec\nReferencea Alternativeb Frequency Referencea Alternativeb Frequency\n376d  119  177  0.598   9  0  0.000   <.001 \n769  777  17  0.021   16  0  0.000   >.99 \n2037  1496  33  0.022   8  0  0.000   >.99 \n3290  2249  112  0.047   17  0  0.000   >.99 \n3306  1523  137  0.083   17  0  0.000   .39 \n3321  1232  29  0.023   16  0  0.000   >.99 \n4511  685  26  0.037   11  0  0.000   >.99 \n4518  710  16  0.022   8  0  0.000   >.99 \n10\u2005771  1416  185  0.116   24  3  0.111   >.99 \n10\u2005773  1467  48  0.032   24  1  0.040   .56 \n10\u2005779  987  401  0.289   18  8  0.308   .83 \n10\u2005814  581  53  0.084   15  1  0.063   >.99 \n11\u2005387  653  15  0.022   4  0  0.000   >.99 \n13\u2005693  1237  38  0.030   9  0  0.000   >.99 \n15\u2005682  1321  46  0.034   8  1  0.111   .27 \n15\u2005685  1342  47  0.034   8  1  0.111   .27 \n18\u2005499  1783  108  0.057   19  0  0.000   .62 \n18\u2005699  1013  46  0.043   12  0  0.000   >.99 \n21\u2005641  520  24  0.044   5  0  0.000   >.99 \n22\u2005270  2282  55  0.024   27  2  0.069   .15 \n23\u2005127d  1151  176  0.133   19  0  0.000   .16 \n26\u2005177  492  11  0.022   6  0  0.000   >.99 \n27\u2005493d  1535  1554  0.503   40  0  0.000   <.001 \n28\u2005253d  3600  487  0.119   34  0  0.000   .03 \n29\u2005398  4671  127  0.026   47  0  0.000   .64 \nTotal  34\u2005842  3968  0.102   421  17  0.028   <.001 \naNumber of reads supporting reference allele.\nbNumber of reads supporting alternative (mutant) allele.\ncSignificance of difference in allele frequency between patient nCoV4 and patient nCoV7 (Fisher exact test).\ndIntrahost variant positions with minor allele frequency \u22655% and meeting selection criteria.\nOpen in new tab\nMeanwhile, among all 84 intrahost variants, only 3 were found to be polymorphic in the population data (position 7866 G/T, 27\u2005493 C/T, 28\u2005253 C/T). This small number of overlap also suggests that intrahost variants were rarely transmitted to other samples. However, we cannot rule out the possibility that the sequence diversity in the population is underestimated by the current database.\nMissing Microbiota Signature Associated With SARS\u2013CoV-2 Infection\nMetatranscriptome data also enabled us to profile the transcriptionally active microbiota in different types of pneumonia, which is associated with the immunity response in the lung [25, 26]. In general, a significant difference in microbiota composition was observed among the nCoV, CAP, and healthy groups (R2\u2005=\u20050.07; P\u2005=\u2005.001) (Figure 3A). However, the clustering of some samples with the NC indicated a barren microbiota in some samples. After removing the problematic samples and ambiguous components, we still found that nCoV and CAP samples both differed from the healthy control samples (nCoV vs healthy controls, R2\u2005=\u20050.45 and P\u2005=\u2005.001; CAP vs healthy controls, R2\u2005=\u20050.10 and P\u2005=\u2005.002), implying that dysbiosis occurred in their lung microbiota.\nFigure 3.\nOpen in new tabDownload slide\nMicrobiota in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid samples from patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), and healthy controls. A, Principal coordinates analysis of all samples. B, Heat map of microbiota composition after quality control filtering (filters were described in Methods). The CAP samples were labeled as virus names followed by numbers; patients with COVID-19 were represesnted by black rectangles, and 2 co-occurring bacterial clusters, by red rectangles. The names of all viruses are in blue, with contaminant genera reported by Salter and colleagues [27] in red. Abbreviations: EV, enterovirus; Flu, influenza; HAdVs, human adenovirus; HC, healthy control; HRV, human rhinovirus; MeV, measles virus; SARS\u2013CoV-2, severe acute respiratory syndrome\u2013coronavirus 2; PERMANOVA, permutational multivariate analysis of variance; RSV, respiratory syncytial virus.\nMicrobiotas could be classified into 3 types (Figure 3B). In particular, the microbiota in cluster I was dominated by the possible pathogens, whereas the microorganisms in other clusters were more diverse. By further inspecting the species belonging to each cluster (Supplementary Tables 5 and 6), we found that bacteria in type III were mainly commensal species frequently observed in the oral and respiratory tract, whereas bacteria in type II were mostly environmental organisms; contamination was therefore highly suspected. Therefore, the microbiota was either pathogen enriched (type I) or commensal enriched (type III) or undetermined owing to low microbial load (type II).\nThe microbiotas in 6 nCoV samples were pathogen enriched, and the other 2 were commensal enriched (Figure 3B). Moreover, 2 nCoV samples [2, 6] with an excess number of intrahost SARS\u2013CoV-2 variants both had pathogen-enriched microbiotas. The overwhelming proportion of the virus may associate with a higher replication rate and could also potentially stimulate the intense immune response against the virus, under which circumstance, an excess number of intrahost mutations would be expected. However, because only 8 patients with SARS-CoV-2 were included in this analysis, and the absolute microbial load was unknown, more data are needed for further investigation.\nDISCUSSION\nRNA viruses have a high mutation rate owing to the lack of proofreading activity of polymerases. Consequently, RNA viruses are prone to evolve resistance to drugs and escape from immune surveillance. The mutation rate of SARS\u2013CoV-2 is still unclear. However, considering that the median number of pairwise sequence differences was 4 (interquartile range, 3\u20136) for 110 sequences collected between 24 December 2019 and 9 February 2020, the mutation rate should be at the same order of magnitude in SARS-CoV (0.80\u20132.38\u2005\u00d7\u200510-3 nucleotide substitution per site per year) [28]. The high mutation rate also results in a high level of intrahost variants in RNA viruses [24, 29]. The median number of intrahost variant in patients with COVID-19 was 4 for variants with frequency\u2005\u22655%, and this incidence did not differ significantly from that reported in a study on Ebola (655 variants with frequency\u2005\u22655% in 134 samples; P\u2005>\u2005.05) [24].\nAn exoribonuclease has been proposed to provide proofreading activity in SARS\u2013CoV [30, 31], and we noted that all 3 key motifs in the gene were identical in SARS\u2013CoV and SARS\u2013CoV-2 (Supplementary Figure 3). In addition, neither polymorphism nor intrahost variant was detected in these motifs, suggesting that the gene is highly conserved. Although we did not find any mutation hot-spot genes in either polymorphism or intrahost variants, the observation of shared intrahost variants among different individuals implied the possibility of convergent or adaptive evolution of the virus in patients, which could potentially affect the antigenicity, virulence, and infectivity of the virus [6].\nIt is worth noting that the SARS\u2013CoV-2 genome in patients could be highly diverse, which was also observed in other viruses [24]. The high diversity could potentially increase the fitness of the viral population, making it hard to be eliminated [29]. Further studies are needed to explore how this may influence the immune response toward the virus and whether there is a selection acting on different strains in the human body or during the transmission. In a single possible transmission event investigated in this study, we found no evidence for the transmission of multiple strains. However, it is unclear whether these intrahost variants occurred before the transmission or after the transmission, which would result in different conclusions. In addition, a bottleneck may be involved in the transmission, which could also decrease diversity [32]. Nevertheless, the observation of high mutation burden in some patients emphasized the possible rapid evolution of this virus, despite that its biological significance is largely unknown.\nRecent studies have shown that the microbiota in the lung contributed to the immunological homeostasis and potentially altered susceptibility to viral infection. Meanwhile, the lung microbiota could also be regulated by invading viruses [9, 33]. However, besides finding that microbial diversity was significantly lower in patients with pneumonia than that in healthy controls (Figure 3B), we did not identify any specific microbiota pattern shared among patients with COVID-19, nor among patients with CAP. A possible reason for this could be the use of antibiotics in patients with pneumonia. However, this was not true for all pneumonia samples, because some samples had a substantial proportion of bacteria, including 2 samples from patients with COVID-19.\nIt is well known that secondary bacterial infection\u2014a common complication of viral infection, especially for respiratory viruses\u2014often significantly increases morbidity rates [34]. Thus, the elevated level of bacteria in the BALF samples from some patients with COVID-19 might increase the risk of secondary infection. In the clinical data, the secondary infection rate for COVID-19 was between 1% and 10% [2, 35]. However, the quantitative relationship between bacterial relative abundance/titer and infection is unclear.\nOverall, our study has revealed the evolution of SARS\u2013CoV-2 in the patient, a common feature shared by most RNA viruses. How these variants influence the fitness of viruses and genetic diversity in the population awaits further investigation. Currently, only limited sequences are shared in public databases (Supplementary Table 2); hence, there is an urgent need to accumulate more sequences to trace the evolution of the viral genome and associate the changes with clinical symptoms and outcomes.\nSupplementary Data\nSupplementary materials are available at Clinical Infectious Diseases online.

Serial saliva viral load monitoring generally showed a declining trend. Live virus was detected in saliva by viral culture. Saliva is a promising noninvasive specimen for diagnosis, monitoring, and infection control in patients with 2019-nCoV infection.\n2019 novel coronavirus, saliva, diagnostics, viral load, transmission, COVID-19\nTopic: saliva viral load result diagnosis viral culture sars-cov-2\nIssue Section: Brief Report\nIn 2003, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) caused a devastating global outbreak with a case-fatality rate of 10% [1]. In December 2019, a SARS-CoV\u2013like coronavirus, the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), has emerged in Hubei Province of China and has spread rapidly in mainland China and to other parts of the world [2, 3]. The 2019-nCoV belongs to Betacoronavirus genus lineage B, and is phylogenetically closely related to bat SARS-like coronaviruses [2]. However, the spike, ORF8, and ORF3b proteins differ significantly from other known SARS-like coronaviruses, which may confer differences in pathogenicity and transmissibility from SARS-CoV [4]. Similar to SARS-CoV, the 2019-nCoV can be efficiently transmitted between humans. Cases of familial clustering have been reported [2].\nRapid and accurate detection of 2019-nCoV is crucial in controlling the outbreak in the community and in hospitals. Nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs are the recommended upper respiratory tract specimen types for 2019-nCoV diagnostic testing. However, the collection of these specimen types requires close contact between healthcare workers and patients, which poses a risk of transmission of the virus to the healthcare workers. Furthermore, the collection of nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal specimens causes discomfort and may cause bleeding, especially in patients with thrombocytopenia [2]. Hence, nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal swabs are not desirable for serial monitoring of viral load. Sputum is a noninvasive lower respiratory tract specimen, but only 28% of patients with 2019-nCoV in 1 case series could produce sputum for diagnostic evaluation [3].\nSaliva specimens can be provided easily by asking patients to spit into a sterile bottle. Since no invasive procedures are required, the collection of saliva can greatly minimize the chance of exposing healthcare workers to 2019-nCoV. We have previously demonstrated that saliva has a high concordance rate of\u2005greater than 90% with nasopharyngeal specimens in the detection of respiratory viruses, including coronaviruses [5, 6]. In some patients, coronavirus was detected only in saliva but not in nasopharyngeal aspirate [5]. Saliva has also been used in screening respiratory viruses among hospitalized patients without fever or respiratory symptoms [7]. SARS-CoV can be detected in saliva at high titers [8].\nGiven the benefits of saliva testing, we have tested 2019-nCoV in saliva from patients with suspected 2019-nCoV infection based on clinical and epidemiological criteria as outlined by the Centre for Health Protection of Hong Kong. Here, we report the results of the saliva testing.\nMETHODS\nPatient Specimens\nIn Hong Kong, 2019-nCoV testing was performed by Public Health Laboratory Services Branch in Hong Kong for patients who fulfilled the reporting criteria or enhanced surveillance criteria [9]. A patient is considered to have laboratory-confirmed infection if 2019-nCoV was detected in their nasopharyngeal or sputum specimens.\nSaliva was collected by asking the patient to cough out saliva from their throat into a sterile container, and 2 mL of viral transport medium was added as we described previously [5, 6]. This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the University of Hong Kong/Hospital Authority Hong Kong West Cluster (UW 13-372).\nNucleic Acid Extraction and Real-time Reverse Transcription\u2013Quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction for 2019-nCoV\nSaliva specimens were subjected to total nucleic acid extraction by NucliSENS easyMAG (BioMerieux) as we described previously [5]. Each specimen was mixed with lysis buffer. After extraction, the total nucleic acid was recovered using 55 \u03bcL of elution buffer. In-house 1-step real-time reverse transcription\u2013quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) assay targeting the S gene of 2019-nCoV was performed using QuantiNova SYBR Green RT-PCR Kit (Qiagen) in a LightCycler 480 Real-Time PCR System (Roche), as we described previously [2].\nViral Culture\nViral culture of 2019-nCoV was conducted in a biosafety level-3 facility. Vero E6 cells were seeded with 1 mL of minimum essential medium (MEM) at 2 \u00d7 105 cells/mL in culture tubes and incubated at 37\u00b0C in a carbon dioxide incubator for 1\u20132 days until confluence for inoculation. Each saliva specimen was inoculated in duplicate; 1 tube contained tosylsulfonyl phenylalanyl chloromethyl ketone\u2013treated trypsin (0.5 \u03bcg/mL) in serum-free MEM and the other tube contained MEM with 1% fetal calf serum. Each tube was inoculated with 0.2 mL of saliva and was incubated in a slanted position so that the inoculum covered the monolayer for 60 minutes at 37\u00b0C. Then 1 mL of either MEM or trypsin MEM was added and incubated in a roller apparatus at a speed 12 to 15 revolutions per hour. Virus-induced cytopathic effect was examined daily for up to 7 days.\nRESULTS\nA total of 12 patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection in Hong Kong were included. The median age was 62.5 years, ranging from 37 to 75 years. There were 5 female and 7 male patients. At the time of writing, all patients were still hospitalized. Saliva specimens were collected at a median of 2 days after hospitalization (range, 0\u20137 days) (Figure 1). The 2019-nCoV was detected in the initial saliva specimens of 11 patients (91.7%). For patient K, the first saliva specimen collected on the day of hospital admission tested negative. The median viral load of the first available saliva specimens was 3.3 \u00d7 106 copies/mL (range, 9.9 \u00d7 102 to 1.2 \u00d7 108 copies/mL).\nFigure 1.\nOpen in new tabDownload slide\nSaliva viral load in patients with 2019 novel coronavirus infection. For this figure, specimens with undetected viral load were assigned a value of 101.\nSerial saliva specimens were available for 6 patients. The viral load was highest in the earliest available specimens for 5 patients (83.3%). For patient H, the viral load was slightly higher on day 1 after hospitalization (6.8 \u00d7 107 copies/mL) than on the day of hospital admission (5.7 \u00d7 107 copies/mL). For patient B, viral shedding in saliva was still detected on day 11 after hospitalization. In 33 patients whose nasopharyngeal specimens tested negative for 2019-nCoV, all saliva specimens also tested negative. At the time of writing, viral cultures were positive for 3 patients and negative for 2 patients.\nDISCUSSION\nIn this study, we have demonstrated that 2019-nCoV could be detected in the saliva specimens of 11 of the 12 patients studied. Serial saliva specimens showed declines in salivary 2019-nCoV RNA levels after hospitalization. Viral culture demonstrated that live viruses were present in the saliva of 3 patients.\nThere are several advantages in using saliva specimens for the diagnosis of 2019-nCoV. First, saliva specimens can be provided by the patient easily without any invasive procedures. Therefore, the use of saliva specimens could reduce the risk of nosocomial 2019-nCoV transmission. Cases of 2019-nCoV infection among healthcare workers have been found, with at least 1 reported death [10]. Second, the use of saliva will allow specimen collection outside the hospitals where airborne-infection isolation rooms are not available, such as in outpatient clinics or in the community. In the setting where a large number of individuals require screening, saliva would represent a practical noninvasive specimen type. Third, since healthcare workers are not required to collect saliva specimens, the use of saliva specimens will eliminate the waiting time for specimen collection, and hence the results would be available much sooner. This is especially important in busy clinical settings where the number of available staff is limited.\nAmong patients with serial saliva specimens available, there was a general decline in viral load for most patients, but 1 patient had viral shedding in the saliva for at least 11 days after hospitalization. The use of saliva is preferred over nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal specimens for serial viral load monitoring because this would reduce the discomfort to the patient and reduce the health hazards to healthcare workers during repeated sampling. Our experience with SARS in 2003 showed that viral load often peaked at day 10 after symptom onset. Thus, early detection and isolation of cases was strategic for infection control and provides the window of opportunity for antiviral therapy to decrease the peak viral load.\nThe positive viral culture indicates that saliva contains live viruses that may allow transmission. Respiratory viruses are considered to be transmitted from person to person through direct or indirect contact, or via coarse or fine droplets. Saliva can be emitted through cough, and respiratory droplets containing influenza virus can be found even during normal breathing [11]. Therefore, 2019-nCoV may be transmitted via saliva directly or indirectly even among patients without coughing or other respiratory symptoms. Our findings reinforce the use of surgical masks as a control measure.\nSARS-CoV has been shown to infect epithelial cells in salivary gland ducts in rhesus macaques [12]. The presence of 2019-nCoV in patients\u2019 saliva suggests the possibility of salivary gland infection. However, it should be noted that saliva specimens not only contain saliva secreted from major or minor salivary glands but also contain secretions coming down from the nasopharynx or coming up from the lung via the action of cilia lining the airway. Further studies are required to delineate the sources of 2019-nCoV in saliva.\nOur results have demonstrated the potential for saliva to be a noninvasive specimen type for the diagnosis and viral load monitoring of 2019-nCoV. Because saliva can be provided by patients without any invasive procedures, the use of saliva specimens will reduce the risk of nosocomial transmission of 2019-nCoV and is ideal for situations in which nasopharyngeal specimen collection may be contraindicated.\nNotes\nAcknowledgments.

Near the end of 2019, the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) began transmitting among humans. In the first 2 months following its discovery, > 75\u2005000 cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), causing > 2000 deaths, have been confirmed. Researchers rapidly characterized the viral genome [1] and have already identified a closely related virus in bats [2], pointing to these animals as the likely natural reservoir of this virus. The search continues for an intermediate host animal that may have facilitated the zoonosis, like camels do for Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and palm civets did for SARS-CoV.\nFrom a clinical and epidemiological perspective, there is obvious interest in whether SARS-CoV-2 will adapt to become more transmissible and/or virulent in humans. Before we can address this question, it is important to realize that most evolutionary options available to this virus have already been explored in bats, where there is an immense array of genetically distinct coronaviruses. Viruses in the Betacoronavirus genus, to which SARS-CoV-2 belongs, have likely been infecting bats for tens of millions of years, possibly since the origin of bats themselves [3]. Within this natural reservoir, viruses exist that would cause high and low virulence in humans, as well as those viruses that are easily transmissible from human to human. Evolution tinkers with these viruses in bats, and the epidemiological consequences are seen both in pathogenic zoonotic diseases (eg, SARS, MERS, and COVID-19) and in the less virulent circulating coronaviruses causing common colds. Occasionally, however, some evolutionary avenues are not available to a zoonotic pathogen until after arrival in humans [4].\nEvolution requires genetic diversity, and genetic diversity arises from 2 distinct mechanisms: mutation and recombination. Mutation is the replacement of one nucleotide base with another, or the addition/removal of nucleotide(s). Mutations are the only true source of genetic novelty. Recombination, on the other hand, can increase genetic diversity by placing existing mutations into new genetic backgrounds. Two articles in this issue of Clinical Infectious Diseases explore these sources of genetic variation in SARS-CoV-2. Li and colleagues describe the genetic variability within 7 COVID-19 patients from China. Yi explores potential instances of recombination among 84 SARS-CoV-2 genomes from multiple countries.\nMolecular epidemiology can use the genetic variation of SARS-CoV-2 to trace its history and better understand clusters of transmission. When we examine viruses infecting 2 different people, the amount of genetic similarity between these viruses is a proxy for the directness of their epidemiological relationship. Direct transmission partners are more likely to be infected with viruses with identical or nearly identical sequences. Bear in mind that the genetic differences separating these viruses did not arise between these individuals; rather, all mutations arise during intrahost replication.\nIn this issue, Li and colleagues reveal the intrahost genetic variation of SARS-CoV-2. When these researchers examined genomes from a probable transmission pair who resided in the same house, they found the consensus sequences to be identical. However, in deep sequencing of viral genomes from 7 patients (including this probable transmission pair), the authors report substantial variation in the number and frequency of minority variants within different individuals. Remarkably, despite the limited number of individuals included, they found many of the same minority variants in different, epidemiologically unrelated individuals. This pattern suggests that SARS-CoV-2 is predisposed toward particular mutations, which may continue to reappear as the virus continues to spread.\nRecombination is an ongoing process in positive-strand RNA viruses [5], and coronaviruses are no exception. The evolutionary history of MERS-CoV in its intermediate host, camels, is littered with recombination events [6]. The bat coronaviruses from which SARS-CoV-2 descends also betray a history of recombination [1], although there does not appear to have been recombination distinguishing SARS-CoV-2 from its closest described relative in bats [7]. In contrast, the phylogeny for the first SARS-CoV, which emerged in 2002, does not display evidence for recombination; it is unlikely that this virus lacked the capacity for recombination, only the opportunity.\nSARS-CoV-2 is presumably constantly recombining with itself within every infected individual. However, a homogenous population of viruses recombining with nearly identical relatives will not produce any novel genetic combinations. Genetic recombination has biological and evolutionary consequences only when the 2 recombining viruses are sufficiently genetically distinct.\nIn Yi\u2019s article, the prospect of recombination between genetically distinct SARS-CoV-2 strains is investigated. Robust phylogenetic testing for recombination cannot be performed on such closely related viruses, so Yi relies on detecting cycles in haplotype maps. These cycles represent potentially nonlinear evolutionary histories of viral evolution that is consistent with recombination. However, among such closely related strains, the signal for recombination cannot be reliably disentangled from convergent evolution. A scenario for convergent evolution is plausible based the observation of recurrent minority variants reported by Li et al. Nonetheless, as more SARS-CoV-2 genomes are sequenced and analyzed, a clearer picture of the role recombination plays in SARS-CoV-2 will likely emerge.\nThe impact of this increasing genetic diversity on a hypothetical vaccine design is likely minimal. Vaccine efficacy endures against circulating human RNA viruses that have accumulated decades of evolutionary diversity (eg, measles and poliovirus). The obvious exceptions to this endurance are seasonal influenza viruses, where protective immunity extends over only a matter of years of viral evolution. Whether a successful vaccine is developed or SARS-CoV-2 continues to spread remains to be seen.\nAt the beginning of a zoonotic event, viral adaptation is difficult. The viral effective population size (an amalgam of the number of productive infections and the genetic diversity) is low; thus, natural selection will be inefficient and recombination will not result in particularly novel combinations. However, as the number of infections increases and the circulating viruses become more genetically distinct, natural selection will become more efficient, making viral adaptation more of a possibility. Nonetheless, when SARS-CoV-2 arrived in humans, it was already well-suited for person-to-person transmission, with pathogenic consequences. Furthermore, it is worth remembering that the evolutionary landscape that SARS-CoV-2 will explore in humans is dwarfed by its previous exploration in bats. For now, SARS-CoV-2 genetic variation is likely evolutionarily inconsequential and will be more important for facilitating molecular epidemiology in tracing the origins of novel clusters of viral infection.\nNotes\nFinancial support.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 RNA was detected in the nasopharynx, oropharynx, stool, saliva, plasma, and urine. The highest viral RNA copies in nasopharynx decreased over time while viral load in stool remained high.\nSARS-CoV-2, COVID-19, coronavirus, neonate, viral load\nIssue Section: Brief Report\nThe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), started in China and rapidly spread worldwide, resulting in a pandemic [1]. As COVID-19 cases surge, the number of children with COVID-19 is also on the increase. Since the report of the first pediatric case in Korea, 619 cases aged\u2005<\u200520 years (6.46% of the total cases) with COVID-19 have been reported as of 29 March 2020 [2, 3]. Limited reports from China have described the clinical manifestation of children with COVID-19 to be mild, and asymptomatic infections are not uncommon [4, 5].\nHowever, it is difficult to infer whether neonates < 28 days of age with COVID-19 follow a similar clinical course, because the immune system in early life is unique. Currently, only 3 descriptive studies on neonates with COVID-19 have been reported, and to our knowledge, none has investigated viral dynamics in infected neonates [6\u20138]. In this study, we described the clinical manifestation of COVID-19 in a neonate and her mother, and further analyzed the viral load kinetics of SARS-CoV-2 in clinical specimens from different sources.\nMETHODS\nClinical Analysis\nA 27-day-old neonate and her mother were diagnosed with COVID-19 and hospitalized at Seoul Metropolitan Government\u2013Seoul National University (SMG-SNU) Boramae Medical Center on 8 March 2020. Their medical records including symptoms and signs, laboratory examination, results of SARS-CoV-2 tests, radiologic findings, and management were reviewed. The exposure route to SARS-CoV-2 was described based on the report by the local government and the history taken from the mother.\nQuantitation of SARS-CoV-2\nRNA of the clinical specimens was extracted by using the MagNA Pure 96 DNA and Viral NA small volume kit (Roche, Germany) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Viral RNA was detected by using the PowerChek 2019-nCoV real-time polymerase chain reaction kit (Kogene Biotech, Seoul, Korea) for amplification of the E gene and the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase region of the ORF1b gene, and quantified with a standard curve that was constructed using in vitro transcribed RNA provided from the European Virus Archive (https://www.european-virus-archive.com). This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board at SMG-SNU Boramae Medical Center and written consent was waived.\nRESULTS\nDiagnosis of COVID-19\nThe 27-day-old baby girl was born by vaginal delivery on 11 February 2020 at 38 weeks and 6 days\u2019 gestation with a birth weight of 3.73 kg. The neonate lived at her grandparents\u2019 house with her parents and 2 older siblings. She was directly breastfed from birth. On 2 March 2020, both of her grandparents started to cough and noticed sputum. On 4 March 2020, her mother reported sputum production and a sore throat, followed by chills and myalgia on the next day when the neonate developed nasal stuffiness. The baby\u2019s father reported chills and a sore throat on the same day and was confirmed with COVID-19 on 7 March 2020. Accordingly, the remaining family members were all tested for COVID-19, and the neonate and her mother along with her grandparents were confirmed with the diagnosis. The 2 older siblings tested negative. As the neonate and her mother had not left home since her birth, SARS-CoV-2 seemed to be transmitted from one of the family members, the source of whose infection remains unknown.\nClinical Manifestation\nOn 8 March 2020, the neonate was hospitalized for close monitoring, and her mother was admitted in the same isolation room to take care of her. On admission, the neonate had mild fever of 37.6\u00b0C and nasal stuffiness. Blood pressure was 82/53 mm Hg, heart rate 145 beats per minute, respiratory rate 62 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation 95%. Whole body jaundice was observed on physical examination. Lung sounds were clear on auscultation and the abdomen was soft with normoactive bowel sound. Her jaundice was presumed to be breast milk jaundice, which spontaneously resolved within 2\u20133 days. The neonate developed a fever up to 38.4\u00b0C along with tachycardia from the second hospital day, and fever lasted for 2 days. She also had increased frequency of vomiting. From the third hospital day, she started to have a mild cough yet did not show any signs of respiratory difficulty and was stable without requiring oxygen. No lung lesions were observable on her chest radiographs serially taken on the first, third, and fifth hospital days. The neonate\u2019s laboratory examination was unremarkable (Supplementary Table). No organisms grew on blood culture, and urinalysis was normal. As the neonate remained well, no antiviral or antibacterial agents were administered. She fed well and continuously gained weight. The neonate\u2019s mother remained afebrile and her only complaint was a sore throat with mild sputum production. Laboratory findings were normal and serial chest radiographs were unremarkable. As both the neonate and her mother\u2019s viral test results were negative from 2 consecutive nasopharyngeal swab specimens collected\u2005\u2265\u200524 hours apart, they were discharged home on 26 March 2020.\nAnalysis of SARS-CoV-2 RNA\nSARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in the neonate\u2019s clinical specimens from several sources including the nasopharynx, oropharynx, plasma, urine, stool, and saliva (Figure 1A). At the early stage of the infection, the viral load was highest in the nasopharynx (1.2 \u00d7 1010 copies/mL) followed by oropharyngeal swab (1.3 \u00d7 108 copies/mL). The viral load in the respiratory specimens gradually decreased with time and was undetectable after 17 days from the onset of symptoms. Notably, the SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the stool sample remained high (range, 1.7 \u00d7 106\u20134.1 \u00d7 107 copies/mL) until the 18th day since the onset, even though the neonate\u2019s gastrointestinal symptoms improved. The neonate also excreted the virus in urine at relatively low RNA copy numbers for > 10 days. The viral load of the mother\u2019s respiratory and stool specimens was approximately 100-fold lower than that of the neonate\u2019s on the 10th day from symptom onset (Figure 1B). The mother\u2019s plasma and urine specimens tested negative for SARS-CoV-2. The virus was also not detected in her breast milk.\nFigure 1.\nOpen in new tabDownload slide\nThe RNA (E gene) copies of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 over time in different sources of clinical specimens of the neonate (A) and her mother (B) with coronavirus disease 2019. The dashed line indicates the detection limit (5.7 \u00d7 103 copies/mL). Specimens with undetectable viral load are presented below the dashed line.\nDISCUSSION\nThis study described the viral load kinetics of a neonate, the youngest COVID-19 patient in Korea as of 29 March 2020, and her mother. The neonate was febrile and SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in all of her clinical specimens, with high viral loads in the respiratory and stool samples. Her mother had mild symptoms with SARS-CoV-2 RNA detected in the respiratory and stool specimens at low titers. Fortunately, the neonate as well as her mother recovered well without antiviral therapies.\nLimited reports on neonates with COVID-19 have been published, all from Wuhan, China [6\u20138]. A 17-day-old neonate had mild fever, sneezing, intermittent vomiting, and diarrhea [6]. The 4 other neonates were diagnosed with COVID-19 shortly after birth from mothers confirmed with COVID-19, and it remains unclear whether the cases were from intrauterine transmission [7, 8]. The neonates had mild symptoms and their clinical outcomes were favorable.\nAn interesting finding in this study is that SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in all of the neonate\u2019s clinical specimens, including blood, urine, stool, and saliva along with the upper respiratory tract specimens. In comparison, although exposed to the same infection source, only the mother\u2019s respiratory and stool specimens were positive for SARS-CoV-2 and at a much lower viral load. These findings suggest that COVID-19 could be systemic in neonates, affecting multiple organs, including the kidney and the gastrointestinal tract. Only approximately 1%\u201315% of the adult patients with COVID-19 had RNAemia, and no child with RNAemia has been reported so far [5, 9, 10]. To fight off virus infections in the absence of maternally transmitted immunoglobulin (IgG) antibody, neonates must rely exclusively on their immature innate immune system and their own, also immature, T cells [11]. This makes them vulnerable to viral infections, including SARS-CoV-2. Although previously reported neonates with COVID-19 went through favorable clinical courses, careful monitoring on this specific population at high risk is still needed until more data are available.\nRecent studies have reported that SARS-CoV-2 RNA could be detected in different types of clinical specimens other than respiratory tract samples [9]. In particular, stool samples could be positive for SARS-CoV-2, irrespective of the presence of gastrointestinal symptoms, and remain positive even for 1 month [12]. The viral load in this neonate\u2019s stool specimen remained high even after the respiratory specimens became negative. Of note, the neonate also excreted the virus in urine at low levels. Although respiratory transmission is the primary route for SARS-CoV-2, presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in both urine and stool in the baby is an important finding because these specimens could serve as additional vehicles for virus transmission. Whether the virus detected in urine and stool is viable and infective needs further research. Nevertheless, caregivers need to be educated to practice proper handwashing, especially when changing diapers of neonates and young infants, to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2 among household contacts.\nThis report highlights the different clinical manifestations and viral load kinetics of a neonate and her mother with COVID-19. As neonates could have systemic complications and SARS-CoV-2 could be shed for a long time in their urine and stool, close monitoring of neonates with COVID-19 and good hygiene practices by caregivers are essential.\nSupplementary Data\nSupplementary materials are available at Clinical Infectious Diseases online.

The reported epidemic dynamic in Wenzhou was comparable to the country-wide study performed by the national novel coronavirus pneumonia emergency response epidemiology team [2]. However, we believe that some of the implications may need rethinking.\nFirst, we question the level of synchrony of COVID-19 epidemics among Wenzhou and the 3 neighboring cities of the epicenter, Wuhan (Figure 1). The numbers of confirmed COVID-19 cases in cities were positively correlated to the emigration number from Wuhan [3]. Big data analysis revealed that Xiaogan, Huanggang, and Jingzhou were the 3 cities with the largest influx of Wuhan emigrants during 10 January 2020\u201323 January 2020, with approximately 690 000, 650 000, and 330 000 people, respectively (according to online real-time map of migration at http://qianxi.baidu.com/), while Wenzhou had around 90 000 individuals returning from Wuhan. Moreover, although the symptom-onset date of the first confirmed COVID-19 patient was 1 December 2019, the diagnostic polymerase chain reaction method was not established until 10 January 2020 [4]. The epidemic curves included in the article were constructed using the reported dates of diagnosis rather than symptom onset. In fact, the onset time of the outbreak in the 3 cities near Wuhan might be much earlier than that in Wenzhou.\nFigure 1.\nOpen in new tabDownload slide\nNumber of confirmed novel coronavirus disease-2019 cases in cities of Hubei Province and the Yangtze River Delta region, China.\nSecond, the abrupt increases in reported cases in the 3 cities in Hubei Province on 12 February 2020 (\u201csubsequent outbreaks\u201d in the article) were more likely to be attributed to the change in the fifth revision of the clinical diagnosis guideline for COVID-19 [5, 6]. The clinically diagnosed cases in Hubei Province, but not applicable to the rest of the country, were regarded as confirmed cases if they exhibited 1 epidemiologic clue and had positive pneumonia-related computerized tomography scan results. Previously accumulated clinically diagnosed cases that tested negative were reported as new confirmed cases afterward.\nThird, the NPIs implemented in different Chinese cities may vary significantly nationwide [7]. Different cities had different risk factors and epidemic patterns, thus adding to the complexity of evaluating the impact of public health interventions. The Yangtze River Delta region is comprised of Shanghai, Jiangsu Province, and Zhejiang Province (Figure 1). Nantong City, which has similar geographic characteristics, population size (7.3 million), and an influx of Wuhan emigrants (650 000 people according to http://qianxi.baidu.com/), might be a better comparison than cities in Hubei Province. Nantong reported 40 confirmed COVID-19 cases; this is significantly lower than the average level of Jiangsu Province (0.55 vs 0.81 per 100 000 persons, P = .016). Shanghai, the megacity with a population of more than 24 million, reported 531 cases (2.19 per 100 000 persons). Further, the epidemic intensity of Wenzhou was significantly higher than the average level of Zhejiang Province (6.08 vs 2.53 per 100 000 population, P < .001).\nFinally, the overall usage of facial masks in public spaces had increased to almost 100% in Hubei Province during the lockdown (personal written communication, 2 February 2020). However, this essential measure was not mentioned by Ruan et al.\nNotes\nFinancial support.

Besides optimizing sample type to increase yield and ease of collection [2], the challenge in clinical management of suspected cases lies in deciding whether they may be de-isolated or if further isolation and repeat testing are required.\nNo single indicator may be effectively used to decide on de-isolation of a suspected case. In our series of positive cases, samples from 1 suspected case only returned positive on the fifth repeated sample (nasopharyngeal swab), on the seventh day of clinical illness. Current evidence suggests that transmission of COVID-19 may be possible even from asymptomatic contacts [3], and polymerase chain reaction testing may not return positive initially [4]. Our suspected case was kept isolated because of a high index of clinical suspicion, with a clinically compatible illness and history of close contact with a laboratory-proven COVID-19 case. While multiplex respiratory virus panels, in general, may be helpful in the evaluation of other viral acute respiratory infections (ARIs), even the detection of an alternate respiratory pathogen may not definitively exclude COVID-19 infection. Dual infections can occur in 10%\u201320% of viral ARIs, as has been reported with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus [5]. In our case series, 1 patient with confirmed COVID-19 by a nasopharyngeal sample also exhibited clinical symptoms compatible with dengue fever. This was laboratory confirmed by dengue NS1 antigen test. (P. L. Lim, personal communication, February 2020).\nThere were 2 notable operational challenges in the de-isolation of suspected cases. With substantial numbers of suspected cases admitted for isolation and the need to hold patients for repeated testing, there was a need to manage isolation room occupancy. However, for patients who needed ongoing inpatient care for other reasons, we also needed to address the risk of inadvertent nosocomial amplification, to reduce the risk of transmission from patients who had tested negative early in their clinical illness. A rigorous framework was required to help clinicians de-isolate COVID-19 patients safely.\nAt the National Centre for Infectious Diseases, we have used the algorithm shown in Figure 1 as our decision-making matrix to decide on the disposition of our patients.\nFigure 1.\nOpen in new tabDownload slide\nNational Centre for Infectious Diseases de-isolation criteria for coronavirus disease 2019 suspected cases.\nAbbreviations: COVID-19, coronavirus disease 2019; nCoV, novel coronavirus; PCR, XXX.\nAs with other respiratory viruses, factors such as sample type (lower respiratory samples being preferable in patients with pneumonia) and specimen collection technique will contribute to the sensitivity and ease of diagnostic testing. We addressed the challenge of delayed positivity in coronavirus testing in relation to illness onset, by repeating testing for patients who are within the first 7 days of respiratory symptoms, and for whom COVID-19 is still suspected despite initial negative tests. Our algorithm incorporates epidemiological and clinical features needed to decide the disposition of suspected cases, while acknowledging that microbiologic testing might be negative early in the course of illness. With emerging data and further understanding of COVID-19, this algorithm may be refined further and its performance assessed prospectively.\nNote\nPotential conflicts of interest.

Data from China exhibit a Gaussian distribution with peak morbidity in the 50\u201359-year cohort, while the ROK data have a bimodal distribution with the highest morbidity in the 20\u201329-year cohort.\nSARS-CoV-2, age-specific, confirmed cases, China, Korea\nTopic: china korea morbidity mortality health disparity south korea sars-cov-2 coronavirus pandemic\nIssue Section: Brief Report\nThere are many uncertainties regarding the clinical epidemiology of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that is currently spreading worldwide in a global pandemic whose ultimate impacts are still uncertain but which appears, based on observed impacts, to have the potential to overwhelm the medical surveillance and medical treatment infrastructure of even the world\u2019s most affluent countries. There is a need to gain greater understanding of the highest-risk populations for infection and serious disease from SARS-CoV-2 to support the development and implementation of effective public health surveillance and mitigation efforts, and minimize the adverse effects of the current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic in countries worldwide [1].\nMETHODS\nWe used data on age and sex of SARS-CoV-2 cases published by the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [2], and the China Centers for Disease Control [3] to compare the age-specific rates of morbidity and mortality from recent epidemics in China and the Republic of Korea (ROK) and gain insights into the potential for variation in public health impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic in different countries.\nRESULTS\nWe identified major disparities in the age-specific and sex-specific rates of mortality from SARS-CoV-2 in China and the ROK.\nData from China (n\u2005=\u200544\u2005672 as of 11 February 2020) exhibit a symmetrical Gaussian configuration, with peak morbidity among individuals in the 50- to 59-year age cohort (Figure 1). The sex-specific morbidity ratio among confirmed cases was near parity, with a slight male bias (males, 51%; females, 49%). There was a high degree of difference in sex-specific case fatality rates (CFRs), with fatality rates much higher among males (2.8% CFR) than females (1.7% CFR).\nFigure 1.\nOpen in new tabDownload slide\nComparison of age-specific morbidity and mortality rates among reported confirmed cases from China and the Republic of Korea. Abbreviation: SARS-CoV-2, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2.\nData from the ROK (n\u2005=\u20057755 as of 11 March 2020) exhibited a skewed bimodal distribution, with the highest rate of confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections among individuals in the 20- to 29-year age cohort (30%) and a second peak in the 50- to 59-year age cohort (19%) (Figure 1). There is a high degree of difference in the sex-specific rates of infection from SARS-CoV-2 in the ROK, with female cases (62%) outnumbering males by a factor of nearly 2:1 (females, 62%; males, 38%). The data on fatalities from confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections in the ROK exhibit a reversed-bias ratio to that among cases, with the CFR among males more than twice as high as that among females (CFR: males, 1.19%; females, 0.52%).\nDiscussion\nInvestigations of age-specific and sex-related differences in morbidity and mortality from emerging diseases can provide important tools for identifying populations at highest risk for surveillance, monitoring, and intensive medical interventions and provide insights into geographic, genetic, or cultural factors that may influence the spread of pandemic disease viruses such SARS-CoV-2, within and among different countries and continents [4, 5].\nThe age-specific and sex-specific profiles of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in the ROK are quite different from those of the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) epidemic that occurred during May\u2013June 2015, which was the largest outbreak of the MERS-CoV virus outside of the Middle East region, and involved a total of 186 confirmed cases including 38 fatalities (20% CFR). The Korea MERS-COV epidemic lasted for 2 months, and the ROK government quarantined 16\u2005993 individuals for 14 days to control the outbreak. The 2015 MERS-CoV outbreak in the ROK was almost entirely nosocomial, through intrahospital and hospital-to-hospital nosocomial transmission rather than community transmission. Only 1 of the 186 confirmed cases from the 2015 MERS-CoV outbreak occurred through community transmission [6].\nThe age-specific morbidity and mortality rates from the 2015 MERS-CoV epidemic in the ROK are different in certain respects from those of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in China and the ROK. The general shape of the epidemic curve is a standard unimodal Gaussian curve, with peak morbidity in the 50- to 59-year age cohort, similar to that of the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak for China shown in Figure 1. The sex ratio among confirmed cases from the 2015 Korea MERS-CoV epidemic in the ROK was male biased, with a 60:40 ratio of males to females, the reverse of that observed in the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, which has a 40:60 male to female ratio among confirmed cases reported as of 11 March 2020 [6].\nAlthough nosocomial transmission has been an important factor in the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in both China and the ROK, community transmission has been the predominant driving factor for the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic in the ROK. Improvements in hospital-infection-control policies and practices, coupled with the development and implementation of more sophisticated infectious disease surveillance and response training programs, are believed to be important factors in the apparent relatively low rate of nosocomial transmission in the ROK during the current outbreak.\nThe available data indicate that the epidemiological characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 infections appear to be distinctly different from those of typical human coronaviruses and the recently emerged zoonotic coronaviruses (SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV), zoonotic influenza viruses (eg, H5N1, H7N9, H792), seasonal influenza viruses, and recent pandemic influenza viruses [7]. While many patients develop influenza-like illness that progresses to pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) resulting in hospitalization and/or death, a large spectrum of clinical presentations have been documented, including a growing number of reported cases with mild symptoms and asymptomatic infections [8]. Asymptomatic infection has been reported from adults and children, but the proportion of truly asymptomatic infections remains uncertain [9, 10]. A recent report documented reverse transcriptase\u2013polymerase chain reaction detection of SARS-CoV-2 in fecal samples from an asymptomatic child, which persisted for 26 days following the estimated date of exposure [11].\nThe most commonly reported symptoms in order of relative frequency include fever and dry cough (>70%) and fatigue (>35%), dyspnea (<20%), sore throat (<15%), headache (<15%), myalgia or arthralgia (<15%), chills (<15%), nausea or vomiting (5%), nasal congestion (<5%), diarrhea (<4%), and conjunctivitis (<1%). People with symptomatic COVID-19 infections usually become symptomatic within 1\u20132 weeks following infection (mean incubation period, 5\u20136 days; range, 1\u201314 days). The majority of people infected with COVID-19 virus have mild disease and recover. Approximately 15% of patients with laboratory-confirmed disease develop severe disease with pneumonia and/or dyspnea, of whom about 7% progress to respiratory failure, septic shock, or multiple organ failure. Individuals at highest risk of severe disease and death include people aged over 60 years and individuals with chronic disease. Symptomatic disease appears to be relatively rare and typically mild in children and adolescents [7].\nWe hypothesize that differences in public health intervention practices and age-related sociocultural factors may be significant factors mediating the observed marked disparities in the age-specific and sex-specific rates of infection from confirmed cases in China and the ROK. The most striking anomaly in the ROK data appears to be the relatively high proportion of cases among the 20- to 29-year age group (29% of all cases), which may be attributable, in part, to lower rates of compliance among individuals in this age group with social distancing and self-quarantine recommendations issued by Korean health authorities. Religious affiliations and practices have been an important factor for the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic in the ROK, because approximately 61% of all confirmed cases as of 11 March 2020 have epidemiological links to the Shincheonji religious community, a Korean-based sect with satellite churches in China and at least 24 other countries, with some 200\u2005000 members in the ROK (~0.3% of the ROK population of 51.5 million persons) [12]. Lack of adherence to social-distancing and self-quarantine recommendations also appears to be a key factor in the high ratio of confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals associated with the Shincheonji religious community. Observational data collected throughout the course of the epidemic in the ROK indicate much lower rates of compliance with ROK government social-distancing recommendations by the young adults and teenagers in the 15- to 29-year age cohorts, which could help explain the relatively higher rates of infection among the 10- to 19- and 20- to 29-year age cohorts in the ROK data.\nConclusions\nThe reported data on confirmed cases and fatalities from SARS-CoV-2 indicate highly significant differences in the age-specific and sex-specific rates of morbidity and mortality from the COVID-19 pandemic in the ROK and China. Closer study of the factors underlying the initiation and early proliferation of the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in China and the ROK may provide valuable insights into the development of more effective strategies for predicting and mitigating the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic in other countries worldwide.\nImprovements in hospital-infection-control policies and practices, and the development and implementation of cross-sectoral civilian and military infectious disease outbreak surveillance and response training programs by the ROK government in coordination with international partner organizations such as the World Health Organization and US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, are believed to be important factors in the apparent relatively low rate of nosocomial transmission in the ROK during the current outbreak and the effectiveness of disease outbreak surveillance and monitoring programs.\nThe available epidemiological and observational data from the ROK suggest that reduced rates of compliance with social distancing and self-quarantine recommendations among different sectors of the population\u2014especially the younger adult and juvenile age cohorts\u2014may have a significant impact on the age-specific rates of morbidity and mortality within the population as a whole.\nNotes\nAcknowledgments.

Moreover, the authors highlighted that hydroxychloroquine half maximal effective concentration values \u201ctended to decrease with longer incubation times\u201d and that, in the simulation model, the lung trough concentrations were still above the target concentration on day 10 after a 5-day course of hydroxychloroquine.\nBesides household contacts, SARS-CoV-2 can be acquired in hospital settings, with healthcare workers (HCWs) attending at invasive procedures on the respiratory tract (ie, intubation, endotracheal tube aspiration, or bronchoscopy) at the highest risk. Accidently infected HCWs represent an important source of infection during the period that they are asymptomatic or presymptomatic, as they can transmit the virus to household contacts and to patients seeking medical care for reasons unrelated to SARS-CoV-2 infection. For these reasons, we suggest preventive strategies for those accidentally exposed to SARS-CoV-2 such as preexposure or postexposure prophylaxis to avoid viral transmission, as largely accepted for those exposed to other viral agents such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) [2].\nChloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are able to inhibit replication at early stages of viral infection, increasing endosomal pH at the time of virus/cell fusion, as well as impairing the glycosylation of cellular receptors of many viruses including coronavirus [3]. In contrast, no similar effect on early phases of coronavirus infection has been reported for other drugs proposed for SARS-CoV-2 treatment, which are able to interfere only after cell infection, affecting protease cleavage (protease inhibitors) or viral genome replication (remdesivir or ribavirin). These effects of chloroquine on early phases of viral replication permit the attenuation of vertical transmission in an animal model of Zika virus infection, significantly reducing brain viral load, and make cells refractory to SARS-CoV infection in an in vitro model [4, 5].\nHydroxychloroquine, the HIV protease inhibitors (particularly lopinavir), ribavirin, and remdesivir are the most promising drugs proposed for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) treatment, but currently no drug has been proposed for postexposure or preexposure prophylaxis for those accidently exposed to SARS-CoV-2 [6].\nOn the basis of these investigations, we believe that hydroxychloroquine can be effective in preventing respiratory tract invasion in HCWs exposed to SARS-CoV-2 and that hydroxychloroquine administration as a prophylactic agent could be particularly useful for HCWs attending to high-risk procedures on the respiratory tract in COVID-19 patients. Hydroxychloroquine\u2019s effectiveness profile, its ability to inhibit lung viral replication for a 10-day period after only a 5-day cycle of therapy, and the large amounts of knowledge in term of safety deriving from its use for malaria prophylaxis and rheumatologic diseases lead us to recommend its preexposure or postexposure use for those performing procedures at high risk of viral diffusion in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia.\nNote\nPotential conflicts of interest.

The authors provide a detailed description of major signs and symptoms of overt disease [2, 3], but fail to give an account of minor symptoms that may be present at earlier stages of the infection.\nAfter some patients admitted for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) at the Infectious Disease Department of L. Sacco Hospital in Milan, Italy, complained of olfactory and taste disorders (OTDs), we performed a cross-sectional survey of the prevalence of these alterations in the context of SARS-CoV-2 infection. On 19 March 2020, a simple questionnaire including questions about the presence or absence of OTDs, their type and time of onset respective to hospitalization were submitted through verbal interview to all SARS-CoV-2\u2013positive hospitalized patients who were able to give informed consent. Of 88 hospitalized patients, 59 were able to be interviewed (29 were nonrespondents, of whom 4 had dementia, 2 had a linguistic barrier, and 23 were on noninvasive ventilation) (Table 1). Of these, 20 (33.9%) reported at least 1 taste or olfactory disorder and 11 (18.6%) both. Twelve patients (20.3%) presented the symptoms before the hospital admission, whereas 8 (13.5%) experienced the symptoms during the hospital stay. Taste alterations were more frequently (91%) before hospitalization, whereas after hospitalization taste and olfactory alteration appeared with equal frequency. Females reported OTDs more frequently than males (10/19 [52.6%] vs 10/40 [25%]; P = .036). Moreover, patients with at least 1 OTD were younger than those without (median, 56 years [interquartile range {IQR}, 47\u201360] vs 66 [IQR, 52\u201377]; P = .035). All patients reported the persistence of OTDs at the time of the interview.\nTable 1.\nCharacteristics of Patients With Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 Infection Assessed for Taste and Olfactory Disorders (N = 59)\nPatients No. (%)\nAge, y, median (IQR)  60 (50\u201374) \nMale sex  40 (67.8) \nDays from illness onset to hospital admission, median (IQR)  6 (4\u201310) \nDays from illness onset to the interview, median (IQR)  15 (10\u201321) \nPneumonia at hospital admission  43 (72.8) \nSymptoms at hospital admission   \nFever  43 (72.8) \nCough  22 (37.3) \nDyspnea  15 (25.4) \nSore throat  1 (1.7) \nArthralgia  3 (5.1) \nCoryza  1 (1.7) \nHeadache  2 (3.4) \nAsthenia  1 (1.7) \nAbdominal symptoms  5 (8.5) \nNo taste or olfactory disorders  39 (66.1) \nWith olfactory and/or taste disorders  20 (33.9) \nTaste disorders only   \nDysgeusia  5 (8.5) \nAgeusia  1 (1.7) \nOlfactory disorders only   \nHyposmia   3 (5.1) \nAnosmia  0 (0) \nMixed taste and olfactory disorders   \nDysgeusia and hyposmia  2 (3.4) \nDysgeusia and anosmia  2 (3.4) \nAgeusia and hyposmia  2 (3.4) \nAgeusia and anosmia  5 (8.5) \nData are presented as no.

SARS-CoV has demonstrated in a mice model a transneural penetration through the olfactory bulb [6]. Moreover, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor, which is used by SARS-CoV-2 to bind and penetrate into the cell, is widely expressed on the epithelial cells of the mucosa of the oral cavity [7]. These findings could explain the underlying pathogenetic mechanism of taste and olfactory disorders in SARS-CoV-2 infection.\nDue to limitations related to the diffusivity of the disease and emergency contingencies, it was impossible to perform a more structured questionnaire associated with validated tests (ie, Pennsylvania smell identification test) [8]. However, our survey shows that OTDs are fairly frequent in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection and may precede the onset of full-blown clinical disease. In a pandemic context, further investigations on nonhospitalized infected patients are required to ascertain if these symptoms, albeit unspecific, may represent a clinical screening tool to orientate testing of pauci-symptomatic individuals.\nNotes\nAcknowledgments.

Chloroquine has been sporadically used in treating SARS-CoV-2 infection. Hydroxychloroquine shares the same mechanism of action as chloroquine, but its more tolerable safety profile makes it the preferred drug to treat malaria and autoimmune conditions. We propose that the immunomodulatory effect of hydroxychloroquine also may be useful in controlling the cytokine storm that occurs late phase in critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2. Currently, there is no evidence to support the use of hydroxychloroquine in SARS-CoV-2 infection.\nMethods\nThe pharmacological activity of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine was tested using SARS-CoV-2\u2013infected Vero cells. Physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) models were implemented for both drugs separately by integrating their in vitro data. Using the PBPK models, hydroxychloroquine concentrations in lung fluid were simulated under 5 different dosing regimens to explore the most effective regimen while considering the drug\u2019s safety profile.\nResults\nHydroxychloroquine (EC50 = 0.72 \u03bcM) was found to be more potent than chloroquine (EC50 = 5.47 \u03bcM) in vitro. Based on PBPK models results, a loading dose of 400 mg twice daily of hydroxychloroquine sulfate given orally, followed by a maintenance dose of 200 mg given twice daily for 4 days is recommended for SARS-CoV-2 infection, as it reached 3 times the potency of chloroquine phosphate when given 500 mg twice daily 5 days in advance.\nConclusions\nHydroxychloroquine was found to be more potent than chloroquine to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro.\nchloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, SARS-CoV-2\nIssue Section: Major Article\nIn December 2019 the outbreak of a novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2 or COVID-2019), was first reported in Wuhan, China. The outbreak has since rapidly spread to other provinces in mainland China, as well as other countries around the world. Currently, the number of people diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection is increasing by approximately 1000 cases per day. Unfortunately, to date, no drugs have been approved by regulatory agencies for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection.\nChloroquine is a widely used antimalarial with immunomodulatory effects [1\u20135]. In a recent in vitro study chloroquine was found to inhibit the growth of SARS-CoV-2 in vitro [6]. This finding has been supported by clinical studies conducted in approximately 100 patients with SARS-CoV-2 [7, 8].\nHydroxychloroquine is an analog of chloroquine that has fewer concerns about drug\u2013drug interactions. In the previous SARS outbreak, hydroxychloroquine was reported to have anti\u2013SARS-CoV activity in vitro [9]. This suggests that hydroxychloroquine may be a potential pharmacological agent for the treatment of COVID-19 infection. However, to date, there is no clinical evidence to support the use of hydroxychloroquine as a treatment for SARS-CoV-2 infection.\nThe molecular mechanism of action of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine has not been fully elucidated. Findings from previous studies have suggested that chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine may inhibit the coronavirus through a series of steps. First, the drugs can change the pH at the surface of the cell membrane and, thus, inhibit the fusion of the virus to the cell membrane. It can also inhibit nucleic acid replication, glycosylation of viral proteins, virus assembly, new virus particle transport, virus release, and other processes to achieve its antiviral effects [10].\nA reliable estimation of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine concentrations in the lung, the target tissue, may be used for guiding dose recommendations. Physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) models are a mathematical modeling technique that can predict drug concentrations in human tissues in silico by integrating physiological and drug disposition parameters. PBPK models are widely used in drug development to help identify whether a clinical trial is warranted as well as help guide the use of drugs based on predictions from well-validated models [11, 12].\nIn this study we aimed to (1) investigate the antiviral and prophylactic activity of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine in vitro, (2) build a PBPK model for hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine using data from the literature, and (3) predict drug concentrations under different dosing regimens using the developed PBPK models.\nMETHODS\nIn Vitro Antiviral Activity Experiment\nExperiment Materials\nChloroquine phosphate and hydroxychloroquine sulfate were purchased from Beijing Innochem Science & Technology Co, Ltd. The lyophilized powder was diluted in double-distilled water to 10 mM. Hydroxychloroquine sulfate was readily soluble in water. Chloroquine phosphate was dissolved by shaking the solution at room temperature for 2 hours. The chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine solutions were filtered through a 0.22-\u03bcm membrane and were then stored at\u2005\u2212\u200580\u00b0C. The clinically isolated SARS-CoV-2 virus strain, C-Tan-nCoV Wuhan strain 01, was propagated in Vero cells.\nCell Culture\nThe Vero cells were derived from the African green monkey kidney and were grown in Dulbecco\u2019s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM; Sigma Aldrich, Boston, MA) supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum (HyClone, Logan, UT). The cells were maintained in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2 at 37\u00b0C. The culture medium was replaced each day.\nAntiviral Activity Assay\nThe anti\u2013SARS-CoV-2 activity of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine was investigated in vitro. Cells were seeded into 96-well plates at a density of 1 \u00d7 104 cells/well and were grown for 24 hours. The in vitro experiment was divided into 2 sections, as follows: (1) the treatment study and (2) the prophylactic study.\nTreatment Study\nIn the treatment study Vero cells were infected at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.01 (100 plaque-forming units/well) for 2 hours at a temperature of 37\u00b0C.Virus input was washed with DMEM and the cells were then treated with medium containing either chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine at 0.032, 0.16, 0.80, 4, 20, or 100 \u03bcM for 24 or 48 hours.\nProphylactic Study\nVero cells were pretreated with chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine for 2 hours and then were removed from the drug-containing medium and washed by DMEM. The virus was then added to the infected Vero cells (as described for the treatment study) for 2 hours. Following this, the fresh drug-free medium was added and the cells were incubated for 24 or 48 hours.\nThe supernatant was collected, and, the RNA was extracted and analyzed by relative quantification using real-time reverse transcriptase\u2013polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) (methods described in a previously published study) [13, 14].\nViral RNA Extraction and Reverse Transcriptase\u2013Polymerase Chain Reaction\nViral RNA was extracted from 100 \u03bcL of supernatant of infected cells using the automated nucleic acid extraction system (Tianlong, China) and the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Detection of the SARS-CoV-2 virus was performed using the One Step Prime Script RT-PCR kit (TaKaRa, Japan) on the Light Cycler 480 Real-Time PCR system (Roche, Rotkreuz, Switzerland) with primers. The following sequences were used:\nforward primer: 5\u2032-AGAAGATTGGTTAGATGATGATAGT-3\u2032;\nreverse primer:5\u2032-TTCCATCTCTAATTGAGGTTGAACC-3\u2032;\nand probe:5\u2032-FAM-TCCTCACTGCCGTCTTGTTG ACCA- BHQ1\u20133\u2032.\nAll experiments were conducted in triplicates. The relative expression was estimated using the 2-\u25b3\u25b3Ct method.\nStatistical Analysis\nA sigmoidal concentration-response function, Y\u2005=\u2005Bottom + (Top-Bottom)/ [1 + 10^([LogEC50 \u2212 X] \u00d7 HillSlope)], was fit to the data using nonlinear regression. The EC50 values were calculated using PRISM (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA).\nPBPK Model Development, Validation, and Simulation\nThe PBPK models for chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine were developed using the Simcyp simulator (version 18). The chloroquine compound file was provided by Simcyp Limited (a Certara company; Blades Enterprise Centre, Sheffield, UK), and the hydroxychloroquine compound file was self-built. Physical and chemical parameters were obtained from the literature [15]. Pharmacokinetic parameters, such as liver intrinsic clearance, the fraction of dose entering the enterocytes (fa) and first-order absorption rate constant (ka), were determined from clinical data [16]. These data are summarized in Tables 1 and 2 in Supplement File 1. To further predict drug concentrations in lung fluid, we assumed perfusion limited tissue distribution and included an additional tissue compartment (other than default lung organ) in the model to represent lung tissue. This set up allowed us to use the lung to blood concentration ratio for chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine obtained from animal studies [17, 18].\nValidation Data\nPublished chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine clinical trial data were used to validate the developed PBPK models (details summarized in Table 3 in Supplement File 2) [16, 19\u201323]. Data obtained from the literature in graphical form were extracted using Plot Digitizer (version 2.26, GetData). Pharmacokinetic parameters that could not be sourced from the literature were estimated using extracted data in Phoenix (version 8.6; Certara Company).\nValidation Method\nConcentration-time profiles were simulated under different published clinical trial protocols using the developed PBPK models for hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine [16, 19\u201323]. The Simcyp \u201cHealthy volunteer,\u201d \u201cChinese healthy volunteer,\u201d and \u201cPediatric\u201d virtual populations were used in the validation simulations as the reported clinical trials were conducted in Caucasian, Chinese, and children populations, respectively.\nSimulated exposure data were compared with observed data. The criterion to determine model accuracy was based on whether the observed data fell within the 90% confidence interval of the predicted values. The ratio of predicted pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters (eg, the maximum concentration [Cmax] and area under the curve [AUC]) to observed values was used to evaluate model performance. The predicted values were considered reasonable if the ratio of predicted to observed data was within a predefined 2-fold range (0.5\u2005\u2264\u2005ratio\u2005\u2264\u20052.0).\nSimulation Method\nThe exposure of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine in the lung fluid (lung), plasma, and blood was simulated under different dosing regimens (shown in Table 1) using the validated PBPK models. A correction factor for chloroquine base and hydroxychloroquine base was input into the model simulations. Chloroquine phosphate 500 mg is equivalent to 300 mg of chloroquine base, and 200 mg of hydroxychloroquine sulfate is equivalent to 155 mg of hydroxychloroquine base. The \u201cChinese healthy volunteers\u201d virtual population provided in Simcyp was used for the simulations. All simulations were performed with 10 trials and 10 subjects per trial. Virtual subjects were aged between 20 to 50 years of age, and 50% of the subjects were male and 50% female.\nTable 1.\nRatios of Free Lung Tissue Trough Concentration/EC50 (RLTEC) Under Different Dosage Regimens\nRLTEC\nDrug and ID Dosing Regimen Day 1 Day 3 Day 5 Day 10\nChloroquine phosphate           \nA.

The lung trough concentrations on days 1, 3, 5, and 10 were adjusted by the plasma unbound fraction (fu,plasma) to obtain the free lung trough concentration. The ratio of the free lung trough concentration to the in vitro EC50 values (RLTEC) was calculated and the results tabulated. In a recent clinical trial, 500 mg of chloroquine phosphate given twice daily was shown to be effective on study day 5 (RLTEC, day5). This dosing regimen for chloroquine was used as the target for dose optimization for hydroxychloroquine (ie, the RLTEC of hydroxychloroquine should not be lower than the RLTEC, day5 of chloroquine at any time).\nRESULTS\nAntiviral Activity In Vitro\nResults from the in vitro study showed that both chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine have good antiviral activity. Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine were found to decrease the viral replication in a concentration-dependent manner. The EC50 values for chloroquine were 23.90 and 5.47 \u03bcM at 24 and 48 hours, respectively (Figure 1A). EC50 values for hydroxychloroquine were 6.14 and 0.72 \u03bcM at 24 and 48 hours, respectively (Figure 1B).\nFigure 1.\nOpen in new tabDownload slide\nThe antiviral activities of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine for treatment or prophylactic treatment against SARS-CoV-2 in vitro. The antiviral activities of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine for therapeutic and prophylactic use were tested on the Vero cells infected with a SARS-CoV-2 clinically isolated strain. A and B, For the treatment group, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine were added to culture medium after the infection of Vero cells and cells were incubated for 24 or 48 hours. C and D, For the prophylactic treatment group, the Vero cells were pretreated with chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine for 2 hours, and then washed by medium. Virus was added to infect cells. After that, the fresh drug-free medium was added and cells were incubated for 24 or 48 hours. The viral yield in the cell supernatant was quantified by RT-PCR. Abbreviations: RT-PCR, reverse transcriptase\u2013polymerase chain reaction; SARS-CoV-2, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2.\nAntiviral Pretreatment Activity In Vitro\nHydroxychloroquine exhibited a superior in vitro antiviral effect in comparison to chloroquine when the drug was added prior to the viral challenge. The EC50 values for chloroquine were greater than 100 and 18.01 \u03bcM at 24 and 48 hours, respectively. EC50 values for hydroxychloroquine were 6.25 and 5.85 \u03bcM at 24 and 48 hours, respectively. It was noted that, with longer incubation times, the EC50 values for chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine tended to decrease. The inhibitory effect of chloroquine was poor. This was particularly evident at 24 hours whereby, even at the highest concentration of chloroquine used in the study, the inhibition rate did not exceed 50% (Figure 1C, D).\nPBPK Model Development, Validation, and Simulation Validation Results\nThe predicted and observed plasma/blood concentration time profiles for chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are shown in Figure 2. Intravenous data were used to understand the distribution and elimination phase of the 2 drugs, and oral administration data were used to understand the intracorporal absorption process. Most of the observed data fell within the 90% prediction interval. The ratio of predicted to observed PK parameters (Cmax and AUC) were within the range of 0.5 to 2.0 (details summarized in Table 4 in Supplement File 2), indicating that the prediction accuracy of the developed PBPK models was acceptable and could be used to simulate the different dosing scenarios.\nFigure 2.\nOpen in new tabDownload slide\nPredicted and observed mean arithmetic concentration profiles.

It can be seen that the lung, blood, and plasma concentrations of chloroquine increased slowly after the first dose was given and were yet to reach steady state on day 10. The simulated chloroquine concentration in lung tissue was much higher than in plasma, where the lung to plasma ratio increased with time and reached a ratio of approximately 400. The projected lung, blood, and plasma concentrations of hydroxychloroquine rapidly increased and reached steady state following the initial loading dose and subsequent maintenance doses (Figure 3B, C).\nFigure 3.\nOpen in new tabDownload slide\nPredicted plasma (A), blood (B), and lung (C) concentration\u2013time profiles of CQ under the dose regimen A, and HCQ under dose regimen B, regimen C, regimen D, regimen E, and regimen F. Lung tissue concentrations were predicted based on animal data (see Methods). Abbreviations: conc, concentration; CQ, chloroquine; HCQ, hydroxychloroquine.\nSuggested Dosing Regimens for Hydroxychloroquine to Treat SARS-CoV-2 Infection\nThe free lung trough concentrations were also projected from the simulations. The RLTEC under the different dosing regimens is shown in Table 1. The RLTEC values of hydroxychloroquine were found to be higher than the RLTEC values of chloroquine on days 1, 3, 5, and 10. This suggests that hydroxychloroquine may achieve ideal clinical efficacy under the simulated dosing regimens.\nThe RLTEC on day 1 was notably higher for hydroxychloroquine than for chloroquine. This is likely due to the loading dose of hydroxychloroquine given, thus enabling a faster clinical effect. There was no significant difference between the once- and twice-daily maintenance dosing regimens (regimen C and D, respectively) when used from day 2 to day 10; hence, the once-daily dosing regimen may be preferred to improve patient compliance. Despite regimen F being a 5-day treatment regimen, the lung trough concentrations were still above the target concentration on day 10. However, if the treatment duration of regimen F was extended to 10 days (ie, regimen E), it resulted in a higher drug concentration on day 10. Overall, regimen F may be the best regimen while considering both efficacy, safety, and patient compliance. These simulations were used to provide timely support on proper dose selection of CQ and HCQ in a clinical study commenced in February, 2020 in Wuhan City (http://www.chictr.org.cn/showproj.aspx?proj=49482).\nDISCUSSION\nIn this study, hydroxychloroquine exhibited better in vitro anti\u2013SARS-CoV-2 activity than chloroquine. This was demonstrated by the EC50 values for hydroxychloroquine always being smaller than the EC50 values for chloroquine, indicating that hydroxychloroquine has a more potent antiviral activity (shown in Figure 1). In the study by Wang et al [6], chloroquine was shown to have an inhibitory effect on SARS-CoV-2 with an EC50 value of 1.13 \u03bcM after a 48-hour incubation time. These findings are comparable to our in vitro chloroquine results of an EC50 value of 5.47 \u03bcM. In addition, an unpublished clinical trial has demonstrated the therapeutic effect of chloroquine in patients with SARS-CoV-2. On the basis of hydroxychloroquine\u2019s superior antiviral and prophylactic activity, as well as its more tolerable safety profile in comparison to chloroquine, we believe that hydroxychloroquine may be a promising drug for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection [24].\nIn our study we noted that the EC50 values for hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine decreased with longer incubation times. This suggests that incubation time may influence the drug\u2019s antiviral activity. Both hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine have been reported to accumulate in cells [25]. It is possible that a longer incubation time may provide more time for the drug to accumulate to higher intracellular concentrations and ultimately exhibit a better antiviral effect [26]. Another possible explanation is that the drug-induced cytotoxicity may take time to develop, and hence, the drug effect may increase with time [27].\nThe PBPK model for hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine was validated with in vivo PK data from humans, with predictions of lung tissue drug concentrations supported by findings in rats and mice. A high lung to plasma partition coefficient ratio (Kp ratio) reported in animal studies was used to imitate the drugs\u2019 high accumulation in lung tissue. The Kp ratio of both drugs for humans was assumed to be same as the ratio for chloroquine in rats because there were no human data available. This assumption may be reasonable as the transportation of both drugs is completely via passive diffusion (ie, no transporters are involved). Further cell and animal researches are underway to update these PBPK models (manuscripts in preparation).\nIn some patients it has been reported that their immune response to the SARS-CoV-2 virus results in an increase of cytokines interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-10 [13, 28]. This may progress to a cytokine storm, followed by multiorgan failure and potentially death. Both hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine have immunomodulatory effects and can suppress the increase of immune factors [29, 30]. Bearing this in mind, it is possible that early treatment with either of the drugs may help prevent the progression of the disease to a critical, life-threatening state. In critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 the use of corticosteroids may be harmful [31]; however, the use of immunosuppressants (eg, tocilizumab) is not ideal either as they can suppress the immune system and lead to an increased risk of infection [32]. In this setting, hydroxychloroquine may be an ideal drug to treat SARS-CoV-2 infection as it can inhibit the virus via its antiviral effects and help mediate the cytokine storm via its immunomodulatory effects. Based on work conducted in our laboratory, we recommend the concomitant use of low-dose hydroxychloroquine with an anti-inflammatory drug to help mitigate the cytokine storm in critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2.\nSeveral clinical trials are currently investigating the use of hydroxychloroquine to treat SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, it is worth noting that the dosing regimens used in these trials are mainly based on previous clinical experience, raising the concern that adverse effects may occur in study participants (The dose regimen of chloroquine phosphate and hydroxychloroquine sulfate from registered clinical trials were summarized in Supplement File 3). In this study, an optimized dosing regimen was designed for hydroxychloroquine to have a high loading dose and low maintenance dose based on its unique pharmacokinetics (ie, high accumulation in cells and long elimination half-life). Using PBPK modeling and simulation techniques the optimal dosing regimen for hydroxychloroquine was evaluated in silico. The simulation results demonstrated that regimen F was able to achieve treatment efficacy as well as have a good safety profile, even considering possible underestimation of drug efficacy to some extent. However, future clinical trials evaluating this regimen are required before it can be widely used to treat COVID-19. The combination of the in vitro antiviral activity data and predicted drug concentrations in this study is being used to support the design of dosing regimens used in a clinical study in COVID-19 patients (http://www.chictr.org.cn/showproj.aspx?proj=49482).\nSupplementary Data\nSupplementary materials are available at Clinical Infectious Diseases online.

The 2019-nCoV has infected several hundred humans and has caused many fatal cases. Determining the origin and evolution of 2019-nCoV is important for the surveillance, drug discovery, and prevention of the epidemic. With more and more reported pathogenic 2019-nCoV isolates, it is necessary to reexamine their origin and diversification patterns.\nBased on our phylogenomic analysis of the recently released genomic data of 2019-nCoV, we showed that the 2019-nCoV is most closely related to 2 severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like CoV sequences that were isolated in bats during 2015 to 2017 [2], suggesting that the bats\u2019 CoV and the human 2019-nCoV share a recent common ancestor (Figure 1A). Therefore, the 2019-nCoV can be considered as a SARS-like virus and named SARS-CoV-2. The 2 bat viruses were collected in Zhoushan, Zhejiang Province, China, from 2015 to 2017 [2]. There is speculation that the 2019-nCoV may have originated near Zhoushan or elsewhere. The new coronavirus was first isolated from stallholders who worked at the South China Seafood Market in Wuhan. This market also sells wild animals or mammals, which were likely intermediate hosts of 2019-nCoV, which originated from bat hosts (Figure 1B). It has been speculated that the intermediate hosts (wild mammals) may have been sold to the seafood market in Wuhan.\nFigure 1.\nOpen in new tabDownload slide\nThe phylogenomic trees of the coronavirus and the genotypes of 2019-nCoV strains. A, The maximum likelihood (ML) phylogenetic trees of the coronavirus with the approximate ML method by FastTree. This phylogenetic tree is a rooted tree with CoV BM48\u201331/BGR/2008 and BtKY72 as an outgroup. Coronaviruses from different sources are represented on the right side of the tree. The 2019-nCoV is labeled in red. The detailed sequence information used in this figure is shown in Supplementary Figure 1. B, A simple model of the 2019-nCoV origin inferred from the phylogenomic tree. C, The ML phylogenetic tree of 2019-nCoV with bat-SL-CoVZC45 as the root, with the approximate ML method by FastTree. The 27 isolates of 2019-nCoV can be divided into 6 genotypes. The 6 genotypes of 2019-nCoV strains are represented with different symbol shapes. Abbreviations: 2019-nCoV, 2019 novel coronavirus; SARS, severe acute respiratory syndrome.\nThe 2019-nCoVs have long branches (0.09) for the 2 isolated in the phylogenomic tree (Figure 1A), indicating that the 2019-nCoVs likely share bat hosts. Similarly, the 2003 SARS-CoVs (human SARS-CoVs) had short branches (0.03) for the bat hosts (Figure 1A). This indicates that there should be more bat viruses closer to 2019-nCoV.\nAccording to their phylogenetic relationships, the 27 isolates of 2019-nCoV examined in this study can be divided into at least 6 genotypes (I-VI; Figure 1C). The 27 isolates were mainly obtained from 4 different places\u2014Thailand and the 3 Chinese cities of Wuhan, Zhejiang, and Guangdong\u2014and all of them were present in people who visited or had contact with people from Wuhan. The genotypes VI, V, and IV (Guangdong and Shenzhen) are located at the basal branch in the phylogenetic tree of 2019-nCoV, indicating that those patients infected by these genotypes of CoV were among the earliest groups to be infected. There were 3 genotypes present in samples from Guangdong province, indicating that the 6 strains were infected from different places in Wuhan. There were 2 genotypes found in the Zhejiang province, suggesting that the 2 strains were infected from different places in Wuhan. The 2 strains detected in Nonthaburi, Thailand, are from the same genotype and perhaps originated from the same place in Wuhan. The sequence diversification between the 24 strains of 2019-nCoV are small, and it is difficult to separate them in the phylogenomic tree. Compared with the rapid reassortment and mutation of avian influenza (H7N9) [3, 4], the degree of diversification of 2019-nCoV is much smaller. But the 27 isolates can be divided into 6 genotypes, indicating that the 2019-nCoV has mutated in different patients. The magnitude of this variation is worthy of attention in the future, and it is necessary to be vigilant for any noticeable, rapid mutations.\nAs of today, the intermediate host of 2019-nCoV has not been determined (Figure 1B). Considering that intermediate hosts are generally mammals [5], they are likely the living mammals sold in the South China seafood market. Therefore, strengthening the monitoring of wild mammals is an urgent measure needed to prevent similar viruses from infecting humans in the future. More than 1000 confirmed cases have been reported in China. The number of provinces and cities in China, as well as in other countries, with confirmed cases is steadily increasing. It is necessary to further strengthen monitoring to ensure that these virus strains will not cause diseases like the global outbreak of 2003 SARS.\nSupplementary Data\nSupplementary materials are available at Clinical Infectious Diseases online.

We conducted a systematic review to synthesize available evidence regarding measles seroprevalence and measles vaccine immunogenicity, efficacy, and safety in HIV-infected adolescents and adults to provide the evidence base for recommendations on the need for measles vaccination.\nMethods\nWe conducted searches of 8 databases through 26 September 2017. Identified studies were screened independently by 2 reviewers.\nResults\nThe search identified 30 studies meeting inclusion criteria. Across studies, measles seroprevalence among HIV-infected adolescents and adults was high (median, 92%; 27 studies), with no significant difference compared to HIV-uninfected participants (10 studies). In 6 studies that evaluated the immunogenicity of MCVs among seronegative HIV-infected adults, measles seropositivity at end of follow-up ranged from 0% to 56% (median, 39%). No severe adverse events were reported following measles vaccination in HIV-infected patients.\nConclusions\nBased on similar measles seroprevalence between HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected adolescents and adults, and the low response to vaccination, these studies do not support the need for an additional dose of MCV in HIV-infected adolescents and adults. These findings support WHO guidelines that measles vaccine be administered to potentially susceptible, asymptomatic HIV-infected adults, and may be considered for those with symptomatic HIV infection if not severely immunosuppressed. Measles-susceptible adolescents and adults, regardless of HIV status, may require targeted vaccination efforts to reach critical vaccination thresholds and achieve regional elimination goals.\nmeasles vaccine, HIV infection, immunity, safety, immunogenicity\nTopic: hiv adolescent adult measles vaccine safety vaccination vaccines measles hiv infections seroprevalence immunogenicity\nIssue Section: Articles and Commentaries\n\u00a9 The Author(s) 2018.

This systematic review evaluates the diagnostic accuracy of rapid tests for the detection of respiratory viruses. We searched Medline and EMBASE for studies evaluating these tests against polymerase chain reaction as the reference standard. Of 179 studies included, 134 evaluated rapid tests for influenza viruses, 32 for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and 13 for other respiratory viruses. We used the bivariate random effects model for quantitative meta-analysis of the results. Most tests detected only influenza viruses or RSV. Summary sensitivity and specificity estimates of tests for influenza were 61.1% and 98.9%. For RSV, summary sensitivity was 75.3%, and specificity, 98.7%. We assessed the quality of studies using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS-2) checklist. Because of incomplete reporting, the risk of bias was often unclear. Despite their intended use at the point of care, 26.3% of tests were evaluated in a laboratory setting. Although newly developed tests seem more sensitive, high-quality evaluations of these tests are lacking.\nrapid test, meta-analysis, respiratory virus, influenza, respiratory syncytial virus\nTopic: polymerase chain reaction influenza orthomyxoviridae reference standards respiratory syncytial viruses diagnosis viruses healthcare quality assessment\nIssue Section: Review Article\nAcute respiratory tract infections (RTIs) are a leading cause of disease and death worldwide [1]. Recent studies suggest more than half of RTIs are caused by viruses, even in severely ill patients [2\u20134]. Commonly detected viruses include influenza viruses, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), adenovirus, human metapneumovirus (hMPV), human parainfluenza viruses, coronaviruses, and rhinoviruses [5, 6].\nClinical signs and symptoms of viral RTIs overlap with those of bacterial infections. It is challenging to clinically distinguish bacterial from viral infections and different viral pathogens [7]. This diagnostic uncertainty leads to overprescription of antibiotics and extra diagnostic testing (along with costs) to rule out bacterial infections [8, 9]. Rapid detection of viral pathogens could overcome these disadvantages. Besides, prompt viral diagnosis may lead to rapid implementation of infection control measures, early administration of antiviral medication, if available, and shorter hospital stays, resulting in reduced healthcare costs [10\u201312].\nFor this reason, rapid diagnostic or point-of-care tests have been developed. Compared with other diagnostic modalities\u2014culture, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), or immunofluorescence testing\u2014point-of-care tests are often faster, less expensive, easier to use and accessible to staff without laboratory training. They have the potential to be carried out at or near the point of care.\nThere is a clear trend toward point-of-care testing, and the number and quality of rapid diagnostic tests for respiratory viruses has rapidly increased [13]. For clinicians, it is important to be aware of the diagnostic accuracy of the different rapid viral tests, the factors that affect their accuracies, and test performances in daily practice. Previous systematic reviews addressing the diagnostic accuracy of respiratory tests either evaluated only a single respiratory virus (influenza or RSV) or were conducted in specific populations [14\u201316].\nThe aim of our review was to provide a state-of-the-art overview of all available rapid tests for the detection of respiratory viruses in patients of all ages with RTIs. We systematically summarized the available evidence on their diagnostic accuracy for virus detection compared with PCR testing. We assessed the quality of included studies and quantitatively summarized the results in a meta-analysis.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nProtocol\nThis systematic review was built on a protocol based on the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analyses for Protocols 2015 (PRISMA-P 2015), which is registered in the Prospero database (registration No. CRD42015024581).\nSearch Strategy\nA systematic literature review was conducted by searching Medline and EMBASE electronic databases, through the Ovid interface, from inception to 18 January 2016. The reference lists of all articles were hand searched for additional studies.\nThe search strategy was developed in collaboration with a medical information specialist (R. S.) and contained search terms for the most common respiratory viruses (influenza or respiratory syncytial virus or metapneumovirus or parainfluenza virus or human adenovirus or human rhinovirus or human bocavirus or human coronavirus) combined with search terms for rapid diagnostic tests (diagnostic kit or antigen [test or detection] or reagent or immunotest or point-of-care systems or rapid, simple, easy, or quick test), including brand names for the most common commercial rapid tests. The complete search strategy is shown in Appendix A. After removal of duplicates, the search results were imported into Covidence, a Web-based software platform that streamlines the production of systematic reviews (https://www.covidence.org/).\nSelection Criteria\nStudies were considered for inclusion if they were written in English or Dutch and reported original data regarding the accuracy of a rapid test for \u22651 respiratory virus compared with PCR. Although standardization across PCR methods is currently lacking, we selected PCR as the appropriate reference standard because of its current status as the reference standard method for detecting respiratory viruses [17]. Rapid tests were defined (adapted from the World Health Organization simple/rapid tests definition [18]) as any commercially available quick (up to 2 hours) and easy-to-use test requiring little or no additional equipment or technological skills.\nOnly original studies were included. Studies evaluating in-house tests and precommercial versions of rapid tests were excluded, as well as studies using the rapid test result as part of a composite reference standard (to avoid incorporation bias) or performing PCR solely on samples in which rapid test results were negative (to avoid partial verification bias). Case-control studies (use of the rapid test on previously tested known positive or negative samples), case reports, conference abstracts, reviews, and veterinary studies were excluded.\nTwo reviewers (A. H. L. B. and D. P.) independently assessed inclusion eligibility. Initial selection was based on screening of title and abstract. Full-text versions were further assessed for eligibility, and reasons for exclusion were documented.\nData Extraction\nA data-extraction-form was developed with a clinical epidemiologist (M. M. G. L.). Two authors (A. H. L. B. and J. M. B. W. V.) independently extracted data. Information collected included author, year of study and publication, country, study population, specimen type, setting, performance of the test in a laboratory or at the point of care, brand name, and data required to calculate sensitivity and specificity. With these data we constructed 2\u00d72 contingency tables. If 2\u00d72 tables could not be extracted or calculated from the published data, we contacted authors for additional information. In some articles, the same sample sets were tested with different rapid tests. Each test comparison was considered a separate analysis, resulting in a total number of included studies higher than the actual number of included articles.\nQuality Assessment\nThe methodological quality of studies was independently reviewed by 2 authors (A. H. L. B. and J. M. B. W. V) using Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS-2) criteria, as recommended by the Cochrane Collaboration [19]. Disagreement about inclusion, data extraction, and quality assessment was solved by consensus.\nStatistical Analysis\nWith the 2 \u00d7 2 tables, we estimated the sensitivity and specificity of the rapid tests. Each respiratory virus can be regarded as a separate target condition. Therefore, we analyzed the accuracy of the tests for each virus separately. Studies evaluating rapid tests for influenza viruses sometimes reported multiple 2\u00d72 tables for influenza A and B separately. However, most of the included tests detected both influenza subtypes and made no distinction between subtypes. We therefore used \u201cany influenza\u201d as our main analyses and evaluated test accuracy in subtypes in subgroup analyses.\nSensitivity and specificity estimates were pooled into receiver operating characteristic plots. Because sensitivity and specificity were negatively correlated, the meta-analysis should be performed on both outcome measures simultaneously. For this, we used a bivariate random effects meta-regression model [20]. To investigate the effect of potential sources of heterogeneity, we added the following covariates to the model: study population (children vs adults), commercial brand of the rapid test, and whether or not the test was performed at the point of care. We calculated summary sensitivity and specificity estimates for each covariate. To assess the effect of study quality, we performed sensitivity analyses. All analyses were performed using SAS software, version 9.4.\nRESULTS\nSearch Results\nOur literature searches identified 3527 articles. After screening, 383 articles were eligible for full-text review, of which 258 were excluded (Figure 1). The main reasons for exclusion were that the rapid test was evaluated in a case-control study, the test could not be performed rapid, the study did not include original data, a reference test other than PCR was used, or the study was not reported in English or Dutch. Because several reports evaluated >1 test, 179 separate studies were included in the systematic review and meta-analysis. Of these, 134 studies (74.9%) evaluated rapid tests for influenza viruses, 32 (17.9%) for RSV, and the remaining 13 (7.3%) for other respiratory viruses (hMPV, adenovirus, and parainfluenza virus; Table 1).\nFigure 1.\nOpen in new tabDownload slide\nPreferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) flow diagram.\nTable 1.\nCharacteristics of Included Studies\nCharacteristic Studies, No. (%)\nVirus evaluated   \nInfluenza virus (A, B, H1N1, A, and B)  134 (74.9) \nRSV  32 (17.9) \nAdenovirus  6 (3.4) \nHuman metapneumovirus  5 (2.8) \nParainfluenza virus type 1\u20133  2 (1.1) \nPopulation   \nChildren  74 (41.3) \nAdults  14 (7.8) \nMixed/not reported  91 (50.8) \nMost frequently studied tests (company)a   \nInfluenza virus   \nQuickVue Influenza A+B (Quidel)  26 (14.5) \nBinaxNOW Influenza A&B (Alere Scarborough)  19 (10.6) \nDirectigen EZ FluA+B (Directigen-EZ, Becton Dickinson)  16 (8.9) \nSofia Influenza A+B (Quidel)  9 (5.0) \nRSV   \nBinaxNOW RSV (Alere Scarborough)  6 (3.3) \nBD Veritor RSV (BD Diagnostics)  5 (2.8) \nSofia RSV (Quidel)  4 (2.2) \nDirectigen EZ RSV (Becton Dickinson)  3 (1.7) \nMultiplex test   \nmariPOC (ArcDia International)  15 (8.4) \nOther rapid tests  77 (43.0) \nPoint-of-care testing  47 (26.3) \nAbbreviation: RSV, respiratory syncytial virus.\nOpen in new tab\nCharacteristics of Included Studies\nSupplementary Table 1 provides the main characteristics of included studies. Supplementary Figure 1 displays the accompanying forest plots of the estimated sensitivities and specificities. Table 1 shows that a total of 50 different rapid tests were evaluated. The most frequently studied tests for influenza were Alere BinaxNOW Influenza A&B Test, Quidel QuickVue Influenza A+B, BD Directigen EZ Flu A+B, and Quidel Sofia Influenza A+B FIA. For RSV, BD Veritor System, Alere BinaxNOW RSV Card, and Quidel Sofia RSV FIA were evaluated most frequently. Most studies were conducted in either children or populations including both adults and children. Of the studied rapid tests, 26.3% were evaluated at the point of care.\nQuality of Included Studies\nAn overview of the risk of bias and concerns regarding applicability of included articles is presented in Figure 2. Because of our inclusion and exclusion criteria, studies were free of spectrum, incorporation, and partial verification bias, and all included studies used an appropriate reference standard. Nevertheless, several study characteristics might incorporate a risk of bias. Because inclusion and exclusion criteria were often defined unclearly or not at all, the risk of bias regarding patient selection was difficult to assess. In at least 37 articles (29.6%), the index test was performed at the point of care, suggesting that index test results were interpreted without knowledge of reference standard results. In 8 of these articles, additional information was available on the clinical feasibility or logistical organization of the test. Owing to frequent incomplete description of study characteristics that might result in a risk of bias, these items were difficult to assess, resulting in an unclear risk. The concerns regarding applicability were generally low.\nFigure 2.\nOpen in new tabDownload slide\nQuality assessment of included studies using Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS-2) criteria.\nOverall Accuracy of Rapid Tests for Influenza and Respiratory Syncytial Virus\nFor influenza, sensitivity ranged from 4.4% to 100.0%. For all rapid tests that can detect influenza, that summary estimate was 61.1% for sensitivity (95% confidence interval [CI], 53.3%\u201368.3%) and 98.9% for specificity (98.4%\u201399.3%). Operating test characteristics of the studies regarding influenza are shown in Figure 3A.\nFigure 3.\nOpen in new tabDownload slide\nHierarchical summary receiver operating characteristic curve plots of studies evaluating rapid tests for influenza (A) and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) (B). Each circle indicates a single included study, with the size of the circle proportionate to the size of the study.\nFor RSV, sensitivity had more variation than specificity, but sensitivity estimates were higher than for influenza, ranging from 41.2% to 88.6% (Figure 3B). The summary sensitivity and specificity for all studies evaluating RSV were 75.3% (95% CI, 72.6%\u201377.8%) and 98.7% (97.3%\u201399.4%), respectively. Owing to the small number of included studies for adenovirus, hMPV, and parainfluenza virus types 1\u20133, meta-analysis was not performed.\nInvestigation of Heterogeneity\nThe sensitivities of rapid tests for influenza A (68.1%; 95% CI, 58.9%\u201376.0%) and influenza B (71.0%; 56.8%\u201382.1%) were comparable. Several studies (n=58) only evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of rapid tests for detecting H1N1. Most of these rapid tests were not developed to detect H1N1 specifically. The sensitivity for H1N1 was generally lower (54.0%, 95% CI 47.6\u201360.3) than for the other virus subtypes (Table 2).\nTable 2.\nSubgroup Analyses: Accuracy Estimates\nPooled Sensitivity (95% CI) Pooled Specificity (95% CI)\nInfluenza  \nVirus type     \nInfluenza A  68.1 (58.9\u201376.0)  99.2 (98.5\u201399.6) \nH1N1  54.0 (47.6\u201360.3)  99.1 (98.5\u201399.5) \nInfluenza B  71.0 (56.8\u201382.1)  99.6 (99.2\u201399.8) \nInfluenza A+B  61.1 (53.3\u201368.3)  98.9 (98.4\u201399.3) \nPopulation     \nChildren  66.1 (52.9\u201379.3)  98.3 (97.2\u201399.5) \nAdults  34.1 (14.0\u201354.1)  99.2 (98.2\u2013100.0) \nPoint-of-care testing  62.1 (47.6\u201374.7)  98.4 (96.7\u201399.2) \nRapid test     \nQuickVue Influenza A+B  44.6 (29.1\u201360.0)  99.3 (98.8\u201399.9) \nSofia Influenza A+B  75.3 (59.2\u201391.5)  95.3 (91.5\u201399.2) \nBinaxNow Influenza A&B  44.1 (23.3\u201364.9)  99.4 (98.6\u2013100.0) \nDirectigen Flu A+B  35.8 (11.8\u201359.7)  99.2 (98.0\u201399.4) \nmariPOC  76.1 (53.5\u201398.7)  99.4 (98.3\u2013100.0) \nRSV \nPopulation     \nChildren  75.9 (73.1\u201378.5)  98.5 (968\u201399.4) \nMixed  70.9 (63.0\u201377.8)  99.1 (95.9\u201399.8) \nPoint-of-care testing  76.0 (69.8\u201381.2)  99.1 (95.5\u201399.8) \nRapid test \nBD Veritor RSV  76.9 (71.0\u201382.8)  98.9 (97.1\u2013100.0) \nBinaxNOW RSV  72.2 (65.2\u201379.1)  98.6 (96.5\u2013100.0) \nSofia RSV  80.0 (73.0\u201386.9)  97.8 (93.8\u2013100.0) \nAbbreviations: CI, confidence interval; RSV, respiratory syncytial virus.\nOpen in new tab\nThe diagnostic test accuracy for influenza was significantly decreased when tests were performed in adults (sensitivity, 34.1%; 95% CI, 14.0%\u201354.1%), compared with performance in children or a mixed population (P < .01). For RSV, age did not significantly influence performance characteristics (P = .20).\nTo identify the rapid test with the best performance characteristics, we evaluated pooled summary estimates for each test separately. This was only possible for tests with \u22654 studies. For influenza, mariPOC and Sofia Influenza A+B FIA had the best overall performance, with summary sensitivities of 76.1% and 75.3%, respectively, and summary specificities of 99.4% and 95.3%, although in some studies [21] the specificity for Sofia Influenza A+B FIA was lower. For RSV, an estimated sensitivity and specificity per test could be calculated only for BD Veritor RSV, Sofia RSV FIA, and BinaxNOW RSV. Sofia RSV FIA had the best overall performance. For both influenza and RSV, diagnostic test accuracy was not influenced by setting\u2014that is, by whether the test was performed at the point of care or in the laboratory.\nThe risk of bias for studies evaluating influenza was generally low. We assessed the difference between studies with low risk of bias for the patient domain and those with an unclear risk of bias in this domain. Sensitivity was generally lower in studies with a low risk of bias (53.3%; 95% CI, 42.1%\u201364.1%). For RSV, the investigated quality criteria did not have a statistically significant effect on diagnostic test accuracy.\nDISCUSSION\nMain Findings of the Study\nIn this systematic review and meta-analysis we provided an overview of the rapid tests that are available for the detection of respiratory viruses in patients with RTIs. The sensitivity of these tests varied considerably, but specificity was high. With the result of the rapid test it is thus possible to rule in a respiratory viral infection, but false-negative results are common. The performance of rapid tests for RSV was generally superior to the performance for influenza. A major advantage of rapid tests is their potential to be performed in a nonlaboratory setting, but only 26.3% were evaluated at the point of care.\nAlthough diagnosing RTIs requires a syndromic approach because symptoms of respiratory viruses infection overlap, only few rapid tests currently available can simultaneously detect multiple viruses. Most rapid tests solely detect influenza viruses or RSV. This is historically understandable, because these viruses were considered the most important respiratory viruses. Furthermore, availability of antivirals for influenza renders rapid diagnostic testing of influenza of high priority. However, recent studies indicate that other respiratory viruses, such as rhinoviruses and hMPV, can also cause severe respiratory illness and are sometimes detected at higher frequencies than influenza and RSV [22, 23].\nThe results of our heterogeneity investigation show that rapid test performance is comparable for influenza A and influenza B, which is in line with findings of a previous meta-analysis [14]. Most of the included studies were performed in children, especially those evaluating rapid tests for RSV, which at least partly explains the lack of influence of age on the diagnostic accuracy estimates for RSV. For influenza, however, rapid test performance was significantly better in children, as reported elsewhere [24, 25]. Age is inversely associated with viral load, which may explain better test results in children.\nTesting at the point of care did not influence diagnostic test accuracy, although this finding should be interpreted with caution. In many studies, the test was not evaluated at the point of care, nor was the setting or personnel described. Direct head-to-head comparisons between tests performed at the point of care and in the laboratory were limited. Besides, only 8 of the 37 articles describing tests performed at the point of care included information on the clinical feasibility of the test\u2014that is, whether the test was easy to use, how rapid test results were communicated, or how the personnel performing the rapid tests evaluated its usefulness.\nBy estimating the pooled sensitivities of the rapid tests, we aimed to determine which test performed best. The conclusions should be interpreted cautiously. Because of our random-effects model, we could not evaluate all rapid tests separately, and the newly developed molecular testing devices were evaluated only sporadically in prospective cross-sectional studies [26, 27]. In addition, rapid test kits from the same company might undergo manufacturing changes. When we analyzed only high-quality studies (ie, with a low risk of bias), the overall sensitivity decreased, implying an even lower diagnostic accuracy for rapid tests.\nStrengths and Limitations\nDiagnostic accuracy studies are described in different ways, and there is no standard terminology available [28]. To include all available evidence, we constructed our search strategy as broadly as possible. Data were extracted, and the quality of included studies was assessed by 2 independent reviewers, decreasing the risk of subjectivity to a minimum. In the event of methodological shortcomings\u2014for example, incorporation bias or partial verification bias\u2014diagnostic test performance might be underestimated or overestimated, which we tried to avoid by applying strict exclusion criteria.\nWe deliberately chose to include only studies in which PCR was used as the reference standard, because of its status as the reference standard method for detecting respiratory viruses [17]. This important strength of our systematic review provides a more realistic accuracy estimate for rapid tests. In previous studies using viral culture or immunofluorescence as a reference, pooled sensitivities were 9%\u201314% higher than in studies that used PCR, and test accuracy was overestimated [15]. We did not assess publication bias because no accurate reporting methods for diagnostic test accuracy studies exist [28].\nThe accuracy of a systematic review depends on the quality of the studies included. As demonstrated in our quality assessment, many items regarding the risk of bias were unclear. Sensitivity and specificity calculations are extremely sensitive to the design of a study and influenced by many factors, such as virus prevalence, predominant circulating virus strain, time from illness onset to sample collection, type and quality of respiratory specimen, age, and disease severity [11, 29]. In many studies that evaluated specific rapid tests, these items were lacking or unclear. This is a major limitation in diagnostic accuracy studies in general. Comparisons between tests should be ideally performed in the same study, against the same reference standard, and in the same patients.\nFuture Perspectives\nIn the current era of emerging novel respiratory viruses, there is a growing need for rapid, sensitive, and specific identification of viral pathogens to allow effective prompt antimicrobial therapy, decrease extra diagnostic testing, and implement pathogen-specific infection control measures. Rapid tests have the potential to fulfill these needs, but one should be aware of their current limitations in diagnostic performance and range of pathogens identified.\nMore sensitive and specific rapid multiplex molecular assays are in development. They have the potential to rapidly and accurately identify not only respiratory viruses but also bacteria. Fully automated molecular methods are commercially available and presented as designed to be operated at the point of care [30]. Although these newer tests seem to perform comparably to laboratory-operated PCRs, comprehensive state-of-the-art clinical evaluations are lacking. Besides, in addition to high costs and low sample throughput, major drawbacks of these newer diagnostic devices are the technical complexity of the tests and their dependence on electronic devices [31, 32], limiting their opportunities for direct point-of-care use.\nIn the upcoming years, the nonmolecular rapid tests will still have a role in practical patient care. It is important for clinicians to be aware of their availability and performance characteristics. Our systematic review provides a helpful tool in this understanding. Although some studies have already evaluated the impact of rapid diagnostics on patient management [33\u201335], randomized controlled trials are needed to assess the clinical relevance of rapid tests in terms of clinically relevant outcomes, such as antibiotic use, length of hospital stay, and cost efficiency. In addition, point-of-care testing requires novel strategies for logistics and organization [36]. For successful implementation of rapid tests in the clinic, a laboratory test validation is not sufficient and a high-quality evaluation at the point of care is required.\nSupplementary Data\nSupplementary materials are available at Clinical Infectious Diseases online.

However, it is unclear if alerts are effective in reducing inappropriate CDI testing and/or CDI rates. The aim of this systematic review was to determine if alerts related to CDI diagnostic stewardship are effective at reducing inappropriate CDI testing volume and CDI rates among hospitalized adult patients.\nMethods\nWe searched Ovid Medline and 5 other databases for original studies evaluating the association between alerts for CDI diagnosis and CDI testing volume and/or CDI rate. Two investigators independently extracted data on study characteristics, study design, alert triggers, cointerventions, and study outcomes.\nResults\nEleven studies met criteria for inclusion. Studies varied significantly in alert triggers and in study outcomes. Six of 11 studies demonstrated a statistically significant decrease in CDI testing volume, 6 of 6 studies evaluating appropriateness of CDI testing found a significant reduction in the proportion of inappropriate testing, and 4 of 7 studies measuring CDI rate demonstrated a significant decrease in the CDI rate in the postintervention vs preintervention period. The magnitude of the increase in appropriate CDI testing varied, with some studies reporting an increase with minimal clinical significance.\nConclusions\nThe use of electronic alerts for diagnostic stewardship for C. difficile was associated with reductions in CDI testing, the proportion of inappropriate CDI testing, and rates of CDI in most studies. However, broader concerns related to alerts remain understudied, including unintended adverse consequences and alert fatigue.\nClostridioides difficile, diagnostic testing, electronic alerts, clinical decision support, Clostridium difficile\nTopic: clostridium difficile infections adult diagnostic techniques and procedures medline precipitating factors diagnosis appropriateness cointerventions clostridium difficile alarm fatigue clinical decision support\nIssue Section: Major Article\n\u00a9 The Author(s) 2020.

Outbreak, travel-associated, and passive government surveillance reports were excluded. We performed a meta-analysis using a random-effects model to calculate estimates of pooled incidence, stratifying by studies that reported the incidence of typhoid fever and those that estimated incidence by using multipliers.\nResults\nThirty-three studies were included in the analysis. There were 26 study sites from 16 countries reporting typhoid cases from population-based incidence studies, and 17 sites in 9 countries used multipliers to account for underascertainment in sentinel surveillance data. We identified Africa and Asia as regions with studies showing high typhoid incidence while noting considerable variation of typhoid incidence in time and place, including in consecutive years at the same location. Overall, more recent studies reported lower typhoid incidence compared to years prior to 2000. We identified variation in the criteria for collecting a blood culture, and among multiplier studies we identified a lack of a standardization for the types of multipliers being used to estimate incidence.\nConclusions\nTyphoid fever incidence remains high at many sites. Additional and more accurate typhoid incidence studies are needed to support country decisions about typhoid conjugate vaccine adoption. Standardization of multiplier types applied in multiplier studies is recommended.\nincidence studies, meta-analysis, Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi, typhoid fever, systematic review\nTopic: enteric fever surveillance, medical\nIssue Section: supplement articles\nSalmonella enterica subspecies enterica serovar Typhi (Salmonella Typhi) is the cause of typhoid fever. Typhoid fever is a systemic infection that is an important source of illness and death in low-resource areas [1, 2]. Persons living in areas without access to improved sanitation facilities who are exposed to fecally contaminated water and food are at greatest risk for infection [3\u20135]. Timely access to effective antimicrobial therapy is central to preventing complications such as intestinal perforation and death. Consequently, the alarming spread of antimicrobial resistance in Salmonella Typhi is likely to contribute further to poor clinical outcomes [6]. Although there has been considerable progress with expanding coverage of access to improved water and sanitation facilities in most regions except Oceania [7] and typhoid incidence has declined in some countries, typhoid remains a major problem worldwide [8]. The emergence and spread of antimicrobial resistance in Salmonella Typhi and the long-term efforts needed to deliver water and sanitation improvements has focused increasing attention on the use of typhoid vaccines.\nTwo vaccines, Vi polysaccharide (Vi-PS) and live attenuated oral vaccine (Ty21a), have been widely licensed for typhoid prevention [9]. However, their use is restricted to those aged \u22652 years for Vi-PS and \u22656 years for Ty21a [10]. This, combined with waning immunity after 2 years of vaccination [11\u201313], means that Vi-PS and Ty21a are not widely used in typhoid-endemic areas. Typhoid conjugate vaccines (TCVs) overcome a number of limitations of Vi-PS and Ty21a, having been shown to be safe, immunogenic, and effective in infants and young children [14\u201316]. In October 2017, the World Health Organization (WHO) Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization recommended TCV for routine use in children >6 months of age in typhoid-endemic countries. In December 2017, the first TCV was prequalified by WHO [17], enabling typhoid-endemic, low-income countries priority access and funding for the vaccine [18].\nContemporary estimates of the incidence of typhoid fever are helpful in supporting countries\u2019 decision making about typhoid prevention, including vaccine use. While there have been improvements in the sophistication of efforts to model typhoid fever incidence [2, 19, 20], primary data have not always been at the forefront. Recognizing a recent increase in the number of typhoid fever incidence studies [8], we performed a systematic review of the literature and a meta-analysis. Our goal was to describe, summarize, and analyze high-quality primary incidence data on typhoid fever. We focused primarily on prospective studies reporting incidence either through population-based surveillance or studies estimating incidence through sentinel site surveillance with a healthcare utilization survey to establish multipliers to account for underascertainment.\nMETHODS\nSearch Strategy\nWe performed a systematic review of articles published in 3 databases: Ovid, Scopus, and PubMed. We searched Ovid Medline from 1946 to 19 January 2018 with Daily Update, Embase Classic + Embase, and EBM Reviews\u2013Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials. Scopus and PubMed databases were searched from inception to 22 January 2018 (search strategies in Supplementary Appendix A). Additionally, reference lists of any article included after the full-text review were searched.\nDuplicates from the 3 searches were removed and collated using an online systematic review tool [21]. The resulting list of titles and abstracts were independently screened by 2 authors (J. A. C. and C. Y. H.) for relevance. Any article selected by at least 1 reviewer was moved to full-text review. All subsequent processes of the systematic review were performed in parallel by 2 authors (C. S. M. and J. A. C.), with discrepancies resolved by discussion. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) checklist was used to document the search process [22]. Full texts of the articles were screened for inclusion. After the final list of included articles was established, data for study characteristics and incidence were abstracted.\nInclusion and Exclusion Criteria\nEpidemiologic studies of any design reporting the incidence of typhoid fever were included. No restrictions were placed on age of population, country, language, or date. For intervention studies such as controlled field trials, we used only the control and unvaccinated arms. Only cases confirmed through blood or bone marrow culture were included. We excluded studies where we were unable to separate blood or bone marrow culture-confirmed typhoid from the results of serology (eg, Widal test) or other culture sources (eg, stool, urine).\nWe excluded studies that were outbreak-associated, case reports, or of travel-associated typhoid fever. In addition, editorials, commentaries, and conference presentations or abstracts were excluded. While government surveillance reports (eg, US FoodNet) have valuable data and likely provide very accurate estimates, countries with robust national surveillance systems experience low typhoid incidence, and typhoid fever in these countries is often predominantly travel-associated. The combination of low incidence with the problem of distinguishing travel-associated from non-travel-associated disease underpinned the decision to exclude such reports from this systematic review. Finally, we excluded studies reporting typhoid incidence in special subsets of populations such as only human immunodeficiency virus\u2013infected persons, and healthcare-associated or hospital-acquired infections.\nData Abstraction and Analysis\nStudy characteristics that were abstracted included PubMed identifier if available, first author, publication year, study design, city or region and country of study, sample size (total population of surveillance or size of control/unvaccinated group), number of cases of fever, number of blood cultures collected, inclusion age and range, and criteria for blood culture. We subsequently classified study sites by their United Nations geographic areas and regions [23].\nThe currently available tools for assessing the quality and risk of bias did not translate to disease prevalence or incidence reviews [24, 25]. Therefore, we developed criteria specifically for this review, using established quality assessment tools as guidelines (Supplementary Appendix B). Our goal was to evaluate the overall quality of the study in providing an accurate estimate of typhoid incidence in the study setting. We applied greater weight to questions about study design, patient selection, and criteria for collecting a blood culture. Our form evaluated selection and performance and the reference standard, assigning \u201clow,\u201d \u201cmoderate,\u201d \u201chigh,\u201d \u201cuncertain,\u201d \u201cinapplicable,\u201d \u201cyes,\u201d or \u201cno\u201d to each question. We then assigned an overall score of low, moderate, or high quality to the study.\nData for incidence were abstracted in Excel 2016 (Microsoft, Redmond, Washington). We stratified studies into 2 main types. Studies that estimated incidence through sentinel site surveillance with multipliers to account for underascertainment were categorized as multiplier studies [26]. All other studies were categorized as population-based, which included active household or population-based surveillance, prospective observational studies, and randomized vaccine field trials with control arms. We noted the year the observation period began and how many months the surveillance followed participants.\nWe recorded the number of typhoid cases that occurred during the study period and then divided by the number of months the study conducted surveillance and multiplied by 12 to report incidence as a rate of cases per 100 000 per year. For multiplier studies, we recorded the estimated incidence separately and also noted the multipliers that were used.\nPooled incidence estimates were calculated with MetaXL version 5.3 software (Epigear International) using a random-effects model [27]. As a secondary analysis of published data this study was exempt from institutional review board approval.\nRESULTS\nOur search returned 13 673 results; after removing 6859 duplicates, a total of 6814 titles and abstracts were reviewed (Figure 1). We eliminated 6527 studies as irrelevant, 39 as additional duplicates, and 32 that we were unable to locate. Two hundred sixteen full-text articles were reviewed; of those, we included 49. After initial data abstraction of study characteristics, 16 additional studies were excluded: 11 contained duplicate data to other included studies [28\u201338], 2 used an inappropriate reference standard [39, 40], 2 did not have clear criteria for blood culture collection [41, 42], and 1 was conducted during a typhoid outbreak [43]. A total of 33 articles were included in the analysis [11\u201313, 15, 44\u201372].\nFigure 1.\nOpen in new tabDownload slide\nPreferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) flow diagram of search strategy and selection of articles, systematic review and meta-analysis of global typhoid incidence, 1946\u20132018.\nStudy Characteristics and Quality Assessment\nOf the 33 included articles, 17 (51.5%) were vaccine field trials, 7 (21.2%) household or population-based active surveillance studies, 4 (12.1%) sentinel surveillance, 3 (9.1%) prospective observational studies, and 2 (6.1%) of mixed study design (Table 1).

With respect to location, studies were from 21 countries, including 6 (18.2%) from India, 4 (12.1%) from Pakistan, 3 (9.1%) from Egypt, and 3 (9.1%) from Indonesia. United Nations regions lacking any study data were Middle Africa, Central and Western Asia, Northern and Western Europe, the Caribbean, Central America, Northern America, and Oceania. The participant population age ranged down to 2 months. The median (range) size of the total population under surveillance or size of the control or unvaccinated group in vaccine trials by study was 28822 (860\u20132 238 590).\nThrough our quality assessment, we determined that 5 of the included studies were of high quality [44, 45, 55, 57, 64]. These studies did not place any restrictions on inclusion age, gave clear and explicit temperature and duration for collecting blood culture, and actively searched the community for cases. We rated 12 studies as moderate quality [46, 48, 49, 56, 59\u201361, 65\u201368, 71], and the remaining 16 as lower quality. Multiplier studies were discounted compared with population-based surveillance studies on the basis of lack of validation of the \u201cmultiplier method,\u201d and assumed shortcomings of accuracy.\nTyphoid Incidence Among Population-based Studies\nPopulation-based typhoid incidence studies were available in 26 sites from 16 countries (Supplementary Table 1). There were a total of 50 separate estimates of typhoid incidence; 7 studies provided the number of cases for each separate year of surveillance during the study period [12, 13, 50, 51, 53, 69, 72]. The majority of estimates of typhoid incidence at all sites were older; data for 34 (68.0%) were collected prior to the year 2000. The overall pooled estimate of incidence was 154.0 (95% confidence interval [CI], 115.1\u2013198.6) typhoid cases per 100 000 per year.\nEstimates from South America (9 [18.0%]) and Eastern and Southern Europe (9 [18.0%]) had data collection periods from 1982 through 1991 and 1954 through 1967, respectively. The remaining 32 (64.0%) estimates were from the Asia or Africa geographical region. In study sites located only in Asia, the pooled incidence estimate was 267.6 (95% CI, 182.8\u2013368.2) typhoid cases per 100 000 per year (Figure 2). Six (30.0%) of the sites in the Asia region were from India. The pooled incidence among sites located only in India was 497.2 (95% CI, 291.9\u2013754.8) typhoid cases per 100 000 per year. Two of the Indian studies were from 1974 and 1995 [47, 64], and data were collected from the remaining 4 from 2003 through 2012 [15, 59, 66, 67]. For estimates located only in Africa, the pooled incidence estimate was 112.1 (95% CI, 46.7\u2013203.5) typhoid cases per 100 000 per year (Figure 3). All pooled estimates had significant heterogeneity (I2 > 97%; P < .001, Cochran Q test).\nFigure 2.\nOpen in new tabDownload slide\nTyphoid incidence estimates among population-based studies in Asia, 1954\u20132018.

The overall pooled incidence estimate from multiplier studies was 141.8 (95% CI, 85.3\u2013212.2) typhoid cases per 100 000 per year. All but 1 of the multiplier study sites were located in Africa [57]. Removing the site located in Asia, the pooled estimate of multiplier studies located in Africa was 134.1 (95% CI, 77.9\u2013204.8) per 100 000 per year (Figure 4). Typhoid incidence varied between sites and countries, with no cases reported in East Wad Medani, Sudan [56], and 882.0 typhoid cases per 100 000 per year in Kibera, Kenya [45]. One study was excluded from the multiplier pooled estimate calculations because it did not report the population under surveillance, only the incidence by age group [49]. Heterogeneity was significant in each pooled estimate (I2 > 98%; P < .001, Cochran Q test).\nFigure 4.\nOpen in new tabDownload slide\nTyphoid incidence estimates among multiplier studies in Africa, 1954\u20132018.

Abbreviation: CI, confidence interval.\nDISCUSSION\nWe performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of blood culture\u2013confirmed typhoid fever incidence. Although an encouraging number of typhoid incidence studies meeting criteria for inclusion have been published since 2000, a substantial proportion had data collection periods much earlier and as long ago as 1954. When examined by time and region, there appears to be a secular trend of lower incidence in more recent studies. This is consistent with other work suggesting declining typhoid fever incidence worldwide [8].\nA number of studies included in this review collected typhoid incidence data from the same location over multiple years of surveillance. While some locations such as Alexandria, Egypt [69], recorded stable typhoid incidence between years of surveillance, significant changes in incidence were recorded at others such as Eastern Transvaal, South Africa [52, 53], and Kolkata, India [66, 67]. As none of the studies included in our systematic review were done during recognized typhoid fever epidemics, the multiyear studies illustrate the considerable variation in typhoid incidence that may occur between years at the same site considered to have endemic disease.\nIn addition to variation of endemic typhoid fever in time at the same location, our systematic review illustrates the considerable variation in endemic typhoid incidence that may occur between sites within the same country, between countries within a region, and between regions. This serves as a reminder that limited typhoid surveillance data can be misleading and that decisions for typhoid vaccine introduction should be based not only on surveillance data but also be informed by the occurrence of risk factors for typhoid transmission such as unsafe water and unimproved sanitation facilities.\nSites in the Asia area have long been recognized as having high typhoid incidence [73]. However, some considered typhoid fever to be uncommon in the Africa area as recently as 2008 [74]. The substantial number of new typhoid fever incidence estimates from sites in Africa since earlier reviews [2, 8, 19] confirms that some African sites record high typhoid fever incidence [56] and provides evidence that TCV use should be considered beyond Asia.\nWe demonstrate that eligible contemporary typhoid fever incidence studies were not available for some areas and regions. Notably, no eligible studies were identified from Oceania despite the major typhoid fever problem that is recognized in some Pacific islands [75]. Studies were also lacking from high-income countries, that rely on robust national surveillance systems to monitor typhoid fever. However, typhoid fever incidence is almost universally low in high-income countries, is often travel-associated, and likely contributes little to total global cases [76]. While increasingly sophisticated approaches to modeling typhoid fever incidence provide a means of estimating typhoid fever incidence in locations where data are lacking [2, 19, 20], we sought to focus on systematic presentation of primary data and summary values across eligible studies.\nOur quality assessment identified a number of concerns with published typhoid fever incidence studies. We rated 5 studies as high quality, thus classifying the majority as of moderate or low quality. Our data were also limited by the significant heterogeneity, but given the variation in location, inclusion ages, study design, and dates, this was to be expected. Our search strategy may not have identified negative studies from sites with low typhoid incidence.\nA number of factors drove downgrading of study quality. Multiplier studies have been increasingly used to estimate typhoid fever incidence for cost and logistical reasons in recent years [48]. Such studies are less expensive and less logistically complex than population-based active surveillance studies and underpin considerable recent progress in available typhoid fever incidence data. However, the multiplier method has not been validated in the context of population-based surveillance and is associated with greater uncertainty introduced at each stage of correction for underascertainment. Furthermore, we identified considerable variation in the types of multipliers that were used. We recommend that consensus be reached on standardization of multiplier selection for future work to ensure that incidence estimates derived from multiplier studies are directly comparable.\nWe also found that patient selection may have introduced bias in a large number of studies. The control arms of vaccine trials remain an important source of data on typhoid fever incidence. However, it must be recognized that vaccine trials are likely to be preferentially done in areas of high typhoid incidence to increase statistical power. Furthermore, a number of studies were done in specific age groups or communities, and resulting incidence estimates may not reflect disease in all age groups or the wider population. We also identified variation in who received blood or bone marrow cultures in studies, which may have introduced bias, and blood culture volume adequacy and the proportion of blood cultures contaminated were rarely reported.\nWhile there are concerns for bias, we describe an overall pattern of declining incidence among included studies, with variation in typhoid incidence between surveillance years at the same site and also variation in place within countries and regions. These observations support the recognition of heterogeneity in endemic typhoid fever in both time and place. They also underscore the importance of considering both surveillance data and typhoid fever risk factors or \u201creceptivity\u201d when making vaccine introduction decisions.\nWe encourage ongoing efforts to generate more contemporary estimates of typhoid incidence, focusing on areas and regions where data are lacking, including Oceania and many parts of Africa. We also identify the need to develop a consensus standard on the types of adjustments that should be made in multiplier studies. This systematic review serves as a resource for site selection for future incidence studies, as a data source for typhoid fever modeling efforts, and in policy decisions for typhoid fever control.\nSupplementary Data\nSupplementary materials are available at Clinical Infectious Diseases online.

Data on treatment are sparse. We systematically evaluated the literature on botulinum antitoxin and other treatments.\nMethods\nWe conducted a systematic literature review of published articles in PubMed via Medline, Web of Science, Embase, Ovid, and Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, and included all studies that reported on the clinical course and treatment for foodborne botulism. Articles were reviewed by 2 independent reviewers and independently abstracted for treatment type and toxin exposure. We conducted a meta-analysis on the effect of timing of antitoxin administration, antitoxin type, and toxin exposure type.\nResults\nWe identified 235 articles that met the inclusion criteria, published between 1923 and 2016. Study quality was variable. Few (27%) case series reported sufficient data for inclusion in meta-analysis. Reduced mortality was associated with any antitoxin treatment (odds ratio [OR], 0.16; 95% confidence interval [CI], .09\u2013.30) and antitoxin treatment within 48 hours of illness onset (OR, 0.12; 95% CI, .03\u2013.41). Data did not allow assessment of critical care impact, including ventilator support, on survival. Therapeutic agents other than antitoxin offered no clear benefit. Patient characteristics did not predict poor outcomes. We did not identify an interval beyond which antitoxin was not beneficial.\nConclusions\nPublished studies on botulism treatment are relatively sparse and of low quality. Timely administration of antitoxin reduces mortality; despite appropriate treatment with antitoxin, some patients suffer respiratory failure. Prompt antitoxin administration and meticulous intensive care are essential for optimal outcome.\nbotulism, antitoxin, systematic review\nTopic: botulism antitoxins botulinum antitoxin mortality\nIssue Section: supplement articles\nBotulism is a rare neuroparalytic illness characterized by bilateral cranial nerve palsies and descending paralysis, which may lead to respiratory failure. Disease can be fatal, particularly without treatment. Botulinum neurotoxin (BoNT) mediates the effects of disease [1, 2]. Foodborne botulism occurs following ingestion of toxin found in contaminated foods; outbreaks occur periodically, and contamination of a widely consumed food could cause many illnesses. BoNT is the most toxic substance by weight known, and various countries with biologic warfare programs have weaponized it as a biological weapon. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention classifies BoNT as a category A biological agent [3, 4].\nSeven botulism toxin serotypes, A\u2013G, were described between 1919 and 1970. Most human botulism is caused by serotypes A, B, E, and F, but others have pathogenic potential as well. Paralysis induced by BoNT can last weeks to months. In cases in which the respiratory tract or respiratory muscles are impaired, mechanical ventilation is life-saving. Botulinum antitoxins can neutralize circulating botulinum toxin, preventing toxin binding to the neuromuscular junction, but does not reverse existing paralysis. The mainstays of treatment are supportive care and botulinum antitoxin. These measures have been credited with reducing botulism mortality in the United States from >60% in the early 20th century to <5% at present [5]. Additionally, other targeted treatments have been attempted to ameliorate the effects of botulism, such as cathartics and enemas to clear toxin from the gastrointestinal tract, and guanidine and 3,4-diaminopuridine to stimulate acetylcholine release [6].\nEquine-source botulism antitoxins of varying valencies (anti-A, anti-B, anti-AB, etc) and neutralizing capacities have been used over the past century. Currently, the sole botulinum antitoxin product licensed for treatment of noninfant botulism in the United States is equine-source botulism antitoxin heptavalent [7]. A human-source antitoxin, botulism immune globulin intravenous (BIG-IV), is licensed in the United States solely for the treatment for infants with botulism type A or type B.\nBotulism is rare, with <100 noninfant cases and approximately 100 infant cases reported annually in the United States [8]. Consequently, peer-reviewed studies on the efficacy of botulinum antitoxin are sparse. In nearly a century, only 1 study, involving a retrospective cohort, examined the effectiveness of equine-origin botulinum antitoxin, finding reduced mortality and other measures of severity associated with early treatment [9]. For infant botulism, 1 randomized controlled trial found that use of BIG-IV was associated with reduced duration of mechanical ventilation and hospitalization without reported adverse events [10\u201313].\nA large botulism outbreak, either naturally occurring or intentionally created, may strain resources, and at present, no evidence-based guidance exists to prioritize antitoxin administration. Data-based treatment recommendations are needed to ensure an effective and efficient public health response. We sought to systematically review all published reports and studies on the treatment of foodborne botulism. The questions that guided our systematic review were (1) what benefit should be expected from botulinum antitoxin? (2) Is there a window of time beyond which administration of antitoxin is no longer beneficial? (3) Do any patient demographic or clinical characteristics predict greater benefit from antitoxin administration?\nMETHODS\nThis study was registered on the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO; CRD42015024327). Our systematic review was conducted in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines [14].\nSearch Strategy\nWith the assistance of an expert research librarian, we queried PubMed via Medline, Web of Science, Embase, Ovid, and Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) using keywords such as botulism, Clostridium botulinum, botulinum antitoxin, botulism, botulinum, BoNT, antibacterial agents, antitoxins, botulinum antitoxin, respiration artificial, activated charcoal, cholinergic antagonists, drugs investigational, disaster planning, immunoglobulins, cholinergic, guanidine, anticholinergic, ventilation, antitoxin, antisera, antiserum, antibody, antibiotic, charcoal, pharmaceutical, germine, immunoglobulin, intubation, experimental animal, and nonhuman; the search strategy is detailed in Supplementary Appendix 1. Embase, Scopus, Medline, CINAHL contain conference proceedings and dissertations). Additionally we searched National Technical Information Service, Defense Technical Information Center, and Google Scholar for government documents, and manually included article references for additional studies.\nInclusion and Exclusion Criteria\nWe included any article in the English language including case report, series, cohort, controlled trial, and animal study that reported patient-level data on the natural history of foodborne botulism or the effect of a directed treatment such as antitoxin. Botulism was defined by clinical diagnosis, epidemiologically (reported exposure known source with neurologic symptoms of botulism), or based on laboratory assays. Because of different pathophysiology, human cases of iatrogenic, infant, and wound botulism were excluded. Animal cases were excluded if they did not describe both controlled toxin exposure and antitoxin treatment. Case reports and series of <3 cases were abstracted for descriptive analysis, including specific rare treatments and outcomes, and excluded from meta-analysis and formal statistical analyses.\nArticle Screening and Abstraction\nArticles were screened independently by 2 investigators (J. C. O. and P. K. T.) using Covidence (www.covidence.org), an online tool for systematic reviews. Initial screening entailed abstract review, followed by review of all potentially relevant full text articles. Reviewers determined if cases reported a case of foodborne botulism with discussion of both treatment strategies and clinical outcomes; if these criteria were met, the study was included. In both phases, disagreements were resolved by discussion and consensus was reached on all articles.\nArticles were abstracted using a standardized form developed on Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap) (Supplementary Appendix 2). Study data were collected and managed using REDCap electronic data capture tools hosted at Mayo Clinic. REDCap is a secure, web-based application designed to support data capture for research studies, providing (1) an intuitive interface for validated data entry; (2) audit trails for tracking data manipulation and export procedures; (3) automated export procedures for seamless data downloads to common statistical packages; and (4) procedures for importing data from external sources [15]. Primary abstraction was completed by 1 of 8 reviewers (E. H., A. G. E. L., R. A., D. D., A. S., O. A., J. M., or E. T.) trained in use of the abstraction tool and definitions by 1 investigator (J. C. O.). All articles were independently abstracted and reviewed by a second reviewer (J. C. O. or P. K. T.). Disagreements were resolved through discussion at weekly meetings.\nData Abstraction\nArticles were reviewed for outcomes including mortality, hospital length of stay, duration of mechanical ventilation, and long-term neurologic sequelae. Articles were grouped first by the article type (case series, cohorts and trials, animal studies) and then by the intervention (eg, monovalent, bivalent, heptavalent antitoxin).\nMeta-analysis\nFor meta-analytic purposes, we combined cohort studies, outbreak reports, or case series with N \u22653 to estimate the effect of antitoxin on mortality, ventilation, and hospital length of stay. In studies in which both the toxin type and antitoxin type were reported, only patients who received antitoxin which matched identified toxin exposures were considered \u201ctreated.\u201d\nFor mortality analysis, the odds of death were calculated as a proportion of the total number of treated vs not-treated patients in a given report. Because in smaller studies the binomial distribution may not approximate the normal distribution, we performed a double arcsine Freeman-Tukey transformation to stabilize the variance and restore assumptions of normalcy. We calculated estimated variance by adding a proportionality constant to the observed number of deaths to adjust for zero values; this was equal to the reciprocal of the total number of subjects in the study. Resultant data were combined using the random-effects model prescribed by DerSimonian and Laird [16]. Subgroup analyses were performed by antitoxin type and toxin types. The odds of death for each type was calculated and compared. Heterogeneity was assessed using I2, where 0% indicates low heterogeneity and 100% high heterogeneity. Publication bias was assessed using visual inspection of a funnel plot using the method prescribed by Egger et al [17]. Statistical analysis was performed using Stata (StataCorp, College Station, Texas) and Review Manager 5 (Nordic Cochrane Center, Copenhagen, Denmark) software.\nDuration of hospitalization and ventilation were modeled using mean and standard deviation data from cohorts and case series providing sufficient data to determine patients\u2019 duration of treatment. On meta-analysis, only studies including both treated and untreated patients were analyzed, as interhospital ventilation and extubation practices were too great for indirect comparison.\nEarly vs late administration of antitoxin, defined by report authors, was analyzed relative to mortality, duration of ventilation, and duration of hospitalization using the methods described above. Subgroups were defined by (1) definitions given in the study for early vs late (Supplementary Appendix 8) or (2) patients who received antitoxin within 24 hours of presenting for medical care vs all others. Additional sensitivity analyses were performed on studies with sufficient patient-level data to exclude those who died when calculating length of stay and duration of hospitalization. This was performed to determine the effect of any survivor bias on these time-dependent variables. Finally, using study evidence ratings, we conducted an additional sensitivity analysis excluding the 50% lowest-scoring studies as rated by the evidence-rating tool described below. Results from these sensitivity analyses were compared to the main outcomes to identify confounding by reporting and publication bias.\nMeta-regression was performed on all studies by year of publication to determine the role that evolving supportive care techniques have played over time in each of these domains.\nIndividual Study Evidence Rating\nEach publication was assessed by both reviewers for quality of evidence using a tool developed by the authors (Supplementary Appendix 3). This tool evaluates articles for design quality, level of certainty, and completeness of reporting. Study design and evidence were modified from the criteria used by the US Preventive Services Task Force. The risk-of-bias tool was modified from the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. Completeness was assessed based on the presence of 15 pieces of information deemed pertinent to a botulism treatment article (Supplementary Appendix 3).\nRESULTS\nThe search strategy yielded 13 055 distinct abstracts for screening. One abstract could not be obtained; 13069 were screened, of which 12455 studies were excluded. Full text evaluation was performed on 599 articles, of which 223 met inclusion criteria (Figure 1). Characteristics of the comparative studies included are described in Supplementary Appendix 7. Outcomes are summarized in Table 1. Additional details on the method of diagnosis are shown in Supplementary Appendix 8. Individual studies and case reports unsuitable for quantitative analysis are summarized in Table 2.\nFigure 1.\nOpen in new tabDownload slide\nPreferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) selection flow diagram for studies addressing botulism antitoxin therapy outcomes, 1948\u20132016.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 1.\nStudy Outcomes\nStudy Mortality Ventilation Hospitalization Long term deficits Adverse effects of antitoxin\nDolman et al, 1948[56]  100%  0%  0%  N/A  N/A \nGray et al, 1948 [57]\nbNorthern Queensland  27%  NR  NR  NR  NR \nGray et al, 1948[57] b Northern Territories  20%  NR  NR  NR  NR \nJohnson and Style, 1949[39]  25%  0%  100%  NR  NR \nDolman et al, 1954[58]  60% mortality  NR  NR  NR  NR \nDolman et al., 1963[18]  19.1% overall\n28.9% without antitoxin\n3.5% with antitoxin  NR  NR  NR  NR \nEadie et al., 1964[37]  66% mortality; 50% with antitoxin  1 patient ventilated for three days before death  Mean 2.3 days hospitalization  NR  1 patient developed shock and vomiting after antitoxin, but recovered \nMinter et al, 1964[42]  0%  66% required ventilation for a mean of 11 (1.4)days  Mean of 14.7 (3.1) days  None (duration of followup unspecified)  NR \nRoger, 1964[49]  60% mortality among those not receiving antitoxin\n0% with dose who did  2 out of 8 required mech ventilation  NR  NR  NR \nKoenig et al., 1967[41]  0% mortality  1 ventilated for 4 days  Mean 9.8 (6.9) days  No residual effects at 6 weeks  NR \nArmstrong et al, 1968[50]  33%; the single case given antitoxin died  1; the case receiving antitoxin was ventilated for 3 days before expiring  Two cases were hospitalized for four days  NR; notably one untreated case was pregnant and gave birth to a healthy child 2 months after recovery  NR \nFukuda et al, 1970[38]  14.3%; two received type E antitoxin, one no antitoxin  NR  NR  NR  1 receiving bivalent AB had a strong skin reaction \nFaich et al, 1971[24]  0%  100%, ventilated from 3\u201312 weeks  Hospitalized for 3\u201315 weeks  NR  NR \nDolman et al., 1974[55]  46% overall  NR  NR  NR  NR \nCherington et al., 1975[59]  14% mortality  6 patients required ventilation (duration unspecified)  NR  Survivors were largely symptom free at 90 days; one patient had constipation  Fever following antitoxin administration (1 patient)\nSkin rash due to guanidine (1 patient) \nHorwitz et al, 1975[27]  66% mortality (1 treated with antitoxin, one untreated)  2 required mechanical ventilation until death  NR  NR  Serum sickness due to trivalent antitoxin in survivor \nKoenig et al., 1975[60]  0% mortality  NR  NR  NR  NR \nBarrett et al., 1977[22] b Chefornak  0% mortality  NR  NR  NR  NR \nBarrett et al., 1977[27] b New Stuyahok  66% mortality  1 patient required MV  NR  NR  NR \nPuggiari and Cherington, 1978[61]  0% mortality  1 required six weeks of respiratory assistance  Hospitalized for 8 weeks weesk and 57 days  Recovery at 3 months  NR \nBall et al. 1979[62]  50% mortality  NR  47.5 (31.8) days  At 3 months, one had recovered completely and the other had residual weakness attributed to muscle wasting.

While we cannot exclude that some populations may receive greater benefit from antitoxin treatment, we could not identify such a subpopulation on the basis of the highly limited data set.\nSupportive Care\nAll articles that described survival alluded to the importance of high-quality supportive care, particularly respiratory critical care. However, insufficient detail (eg, modes of mechanical ventilation and nutritional support) in these publications precluded evaluation of specific intensive care components on clinical outcomes.\nRelationship Between Type of Toxin and Clinical Outcome\nMortality among patients treated and not treated with antitoxin, by toxin type, is presented in Figures 2\u20135. Overall, antitoxin reduced mortality (odds ratio [OR], 0.22; 95% confidence interval [CI], .17\u2013.29); a high degree of heterogeneity was observed (I2 = 69.3%). Heterogeneity was largely due to studies not reporting toxin type (Figure 2). Subset analyses by toxin type were significantly less heterogeneous as described below. On meta-regression modeling, study year, design, selection, comparability, and completeness variables were not substantial contributors to heterogeneity (P = 0.86). Egger test identified no evidence of publication bias (P = 0.26).\nFigure 2.\nOpen in new tabDownload slide\nDeaths among botulism patients, antitoxin treatment vs no antitoxin treatment, unspecified toxin type, 1948\u20132016.

Overall effect estimates provided by diamonds, centered on the odds ratio with points extending to the 95% CI.\nThe greatest reduction in botulism-related mortality was associated with the use of type E antitoxin (OR, 0.13; 95% CI, .06\u2013.30; I2 = 10%; Figure 5), followed by type A antitoxin (OR, 0.57; 95% CI, .39\u2013.84; I2 = 81.2%; Figure 3); reduction in mortality was not statistically significant for type B antitoxin (OR, 0.74; 95% CI, .27\u20131.97; Figure 4). Key data on the impact of type E antitoxin come from Dolman and Iida, who examined Canadian mortality rates of botulism type E before (baseline) and after introduction of type E antitoxin therapy [18]. Baseline mortality in this study was derived from secondary data and was thus excluded from the meta-analysis. Dolman and Iida\u2019s baseline was derived from 75 outbreaks with 374 patients in 6 countries; case fatality rate was 30%. In Canada, in 28 outbreaks, 85 of 220 patients were treated with anti-E antitoxin. Among patients not treated with antitoxin, 28.9% died, compared with 3.5% of those treated [18].\nUse of Different Antitoxin Formulations\nStudies that reported both toxin type and administered antitoxin type were less heterogeneous overall and demonstrated a survival benefit to antitoxin (OR, 0.16; .09\u2013.30; I2 = 0%; Figure 6). Fifteen studies reported use of trivalent antitoxin, 10 bivalent antitoxin, and 2 heptavalent antitoxin.\nFigure 6.\nOpen in new tabDownload slide\nSurvival of botulism-exposed patients by antitoxin valence, 1948\u20132015.\nOnly studies reporting specific antitoxin type included. Odds ratio and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) demonstrated by point and lines extending to either side. Effect size (ES) and weighting illustrated by gray squares. Subgroup and overall effect estimates provided by diamonds, centered on the odds ratio with points extending to the 95% CI.\nUse of anti-ABE trivalent antitoxin was most commonly reported [19\u201334]. Trivalent antitoxin, when administered in cases of botulism types A, B, or E, reduced mortality (OR, 0.13; 95% CI, .04\u2013.38; I2 = 0%). Side effects from this formulation were less commonly reported than all other antitoxins with side effects reported. Anti-ABE antitoxin was generally reported as effective and well tolerated. Case series reported occasional residual neuromuscular deficits persisting up to several months after therapy (Table 2).\nBivalent AB antitoxin was the second most commonly reported formulation [25, 35\u201343]; its use was not significantly associated with reduction in mortality (OR, 0.37; 95% CI, .10\u20131.31; I2 = 0%). Information on heptavalent antitoxin includes 2 reports of foodborne botulism outbreaks. One was caused by toxin type A\u2013contaminated canned bamboo in Thailand [43\u201345] and affected 137 patients, of whom 20 were treated with heptavalent antitoxin, and the others with bivalent AB or quadrivalent ABEF antitoxin. No deaths were reported. The second outbreak, caused by type A toxin, affected 8 prison inmates in Utah [46]. All received heptavalent antitoxin; none died. Low mortality in both outbreaks was attributed to excellent critical and supportive care of the patients [45].\nThe largest available data source on heptavalent antitoxin was the unpublished Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s expanded-access Investigational New Drug application. Data included mostly foodborne botulism cases and several cases of wound botulism, infant botulism, and other syndromes. Of 249 patients treated under this protocol, 105 were confirmed as having botulism. One child experienced hemodynamic instability after administration, comprising the only serious adverse event seen with heptavalent antitoxin. Allergic reactions, typically rash, were noted in 6 patients, all of whom recovered without sequelae. Seven deaths were observed in confirmed botulism cases treated with heptavalent antitoxin; none were attributed to the antitoxin [47].\nA variety of other antitoxin combinations are reported in Figure 6, including quadrivalent ABEF [43], monovalent A [48], monovalent E [18, 49], and a combination of bivalent AB formulation and monovalent E formulation [50, 51]. The small number of deaths from botulism reported in patients treated with these agents precludes a statistical assessment of their impact on clinical outcomes.\nEffect of Timing of Antitoxin Administration\nKongsaengdao et al [44] reported on a subset of 18 severely ill patients during a type A outbreak associated with bamboo shoots in Thailand examined in Wongtanate et al [43] and Wintoonpanich et al [45]. In this subset, patients who received antitoxin on day 4 had significantly shorter duration of ventilator dependence compared with those receiving it on day 6 [44].\nSheth et al reported on 6 patients in a botulism type B outbreak associated with bottled carrot juice. Five patients received antitoxin: 3 within 24 hours, 1 on day 13, and 1 on day 45. At the time of publication, 2 patients had been ventilator dependent for >1 year [52]. We treated these patients as having 365 ventilator-days, demonstrating some reduction in ventilator time in those who had early treatment.\nYu et al also reported a benefit from heptavalent antitoxin given within 48 hours compared with later administration [47]. In patients treated early, the proportion of patients requiring mechanical ventilation was significantly reduced and there were no deaths, compared with 7 deaths among patients treated later. Overall, earlier antitoxin administration reduced mortality, compared with later administration (OR, 0.12; 95% CI, .03\u2013.41; I2 = 0%; Figure 7).\nFigure 7.\nOpen in new tabDownload slide\nSurvival for botulinum neurotoxin\u2013exposed patients with early vs late exposure to antitoxin, 1984\u20132016. Four studies which reported \u201cearly\u201d vs \u201clate\u201d groups included. Definitions varied between studies; Sheth et al and Tacket et al defined \u201cearly\u201d as within administration within 24 hours of presentation and late as all others. Yu et al and Oriot et al reported outcomes for before and after 48 hours postpresentation to care. Abbreviations: CI, confidence interval; ES, effect size.\nAnimal Studies\nIn general, animal studies showed some benefit to antitoxin treatment (Supplementary Appendices 5 and 9).\nTherapeutic Agents Other Than Antitoxin\nWe identified no improvement with several agents reported in the literature (Supplementary Appendix 6).\nStudy Quality Assessments\nMost studies were rated as level III evidence (case reports and series, opinions of expert authorities) (Supplementary Appendix 4). Outcome assessments were not consistently high quality, with a mean of 5/12 on our scoring rubric. Completeness of reporting was generally good, with an average score of 11/16.\nStudy design was not a major contributor to interobserver variability (P = .50). Study outcome assessments were similarly not a major contributor (P = .54). Completeness was also not significantly associated on meta-regression (P = .31).\nDISCUSSION\nIn this systematic, comprehensive literature review of botulism treatment, we examined all relevant publications since the early 20th century. Our findings support the routine administration of botulinum antitoxin to botulism patients. Antitoxin treatment reduces mortality, and the available data show that earlier antitoxin administration reduces both mortality and ventilation time, compared with later administration. However, there are reports of benefit even with late antitoxin administration, defined by the authors as anywhere from >24 hours after illness onset to 48 hours after presentation. We found no clear indication of a point in the course of illness at which antitoxin administration was no longer beneficial. Although the nature of the data did not allow for quantitative analysis of the benefits of supportive care, this modality is doubtless essential to survival of patients with severe botulism, as evidenced by decreased mortality since the introduction of ventilator care in the 1960s. Despite some early promising studies for guanidine, we did not identify clear or sustained benefit to any alternative treatment modalities applied to botulism patients.\nQualitative studies and case reports broadly supported treatment with botulinum antitoxin. Several older studies dating to the first half of the 20th century reported dramatic clinical resolution following antitoxin administration with all types (Table 2); the significance of these observations is unclear. It is worth noting that while mortality in patients not treated with antitoxin was high, often these patients did not have access to advanced life support. Therefore, these poor outcomes were likely influenced by the lack of supportive care.\nAvailable data do not suggest any patient characteristics that predict a response to therapy. Because the data do not provide evidence of demographic or clinical indicators for predictors of better outcome, we cannot recommend any specific criteria for prioritizing antitoxin treatment when its availability is limited. Further study is needed to risk-stratify patients and identify patients likeliest to benefit from antitoxin treatment.\nCorrespondence between toxin types and antitoxin serotype corresponded with clinical outcome. The currently licensed heptavalent antitoxin provides appropriate treatment for botulism caused by serotypes A\u2013G. Data available to us were limited to unpublished prelicensure surveillance. Therefore, treatment outcomes should be monitored and analyzed on an ongoing basis.\nRecently, reports of new toxin types have been published, including a novel toxin subsequently shown to be a hybrid type A/F fully neutralized by HBAT [53, 54] and a novel toxin identified and assembled from the published gene sequence of a C. botulinum isolate [55]. These reports illustrate important challenges in the field of botulism. New botulinum toxins of clinical significance may be discovered. The routine analysis and dissemination of clostridial gene sequences can accelerate such discoveries, and likely facilitate assembly of toxins, for purposes hopefully benign but possibly nefarious. Preparedness requires careful laboratory investigation of all suspected botulism cases and ongoing research and development of new countermeasures.\nAppropriate supportive care is considered a cornerstone in survival and recovery from botulism [56, 57]. It must be borne in mind that a substantial proportion of botulism patients suffer respiratory compromise, some despite prompt diagnosis and early antitoxin treatment; therefore, survival of some botulism patients, treated or untreated with antitoxin, depends on high-quality intensive care. Longstanding experience shows that deaths from botulism can be averted by providing meticulous intensive care, including ventilator care when required [52]. Antitoxin should be given as soon as possible along with meticulous intensive care. Likewise, mortality in case series and reports was highest in patients remote from hospital or emergency care facilities. Early recognition and best intensive care unit practices are an important part of the comprehensive care of the botulism patient. In a situation of limited antitoxin availability, the availability of critical supportive care will determine survival for patients experiencing respiratory compromise. Critical care is an essential component of emergency preparedness for botulism events, both naturally occurring and intentionally created.\nOur study has several limitations. We did not include reports of wound botulism in the review, so our findings may not fully apply to that syndrome. Although we made every effort to separate outbreaks and case reports to avoid analyzing the same individual twice, the way that outbreaks are reported and analyzed, particularly in older literature, makes this nearly impossible. For example, several patients are likely reported in each of 2 case series reported by Dolman [18, 58] likely, but it is impossible to determine which. We attempted to account for this with several sensitivity analyses serially excluding these and other high overlap studies; we did not see a substantial change in our overall results.\nOur review includes publications spanning 8 decades. Aside from improvements in antitoxin manufacture, types, and valence, this period encompasses dramatic improvements in supportive care technology and techniques and the rise of critical care as a specialty. The effect of these on outcomes is profound, but we could not methodologically account for it in our results. We must therefore accept that some of the benefit attributed to antitoxin may in fact be due to some of these advances. Thus, we cautiously interpret our results to suggest that appropriate antitoxin therapy in conjunction with high-quality supportive care produce the best outcomes in botulism patients.\nA final limitation is our inability to adjust for the effect of disease progression and timing. Although we did observe some benefit from early antitoxin administration as defined by the report authors, several confounders are inherent in this finding. First, early administration may have been a marker for early recognition and initiation of other interventions. Second, early administration in several studies may have reflected early treatment of clinically milder cases that presented after delayed diagnosis of a severely ill outbreak index case. However, a beneficial effect of early antitoxin administration was reported in nearly all studies examining this measure. Overall, this would support a benefit of earlier administration, but we may have overestimated the degree of benefit.\nAnother significant limitation is our focus on foodborne botulism. This was done primarily because of the different physiology involved in foodborne, infant, and iatrogenic botulism, and allowed us to focus on a less heterogenous population experiencing the most common form of botulism. We do not know how these findings may apply to other forms of botulism.\nIn conclusion, we found that early administration of antitoxin of serotype-appropriate antitoxin, along with high-quality supportive care, was consistently associated with reduced mortality in botulism patients. No demographic or clinical predictors of the response to antitoxin were identified.\nNotes\nAcknowledgments.\u2003We gratefully acknowledge the contribution of Joanne Taliano, CDC librarian, for her role in developing and executing the systematic review literature search; and Elliott Churchill, for expert editorial advice.\nDisclaimer.\u2003The contents of this work are solely the responsibility of the authors and do not necessarily represent the official views of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) or the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).
