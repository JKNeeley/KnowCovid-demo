The drug, APN01, is a soluble, recombinant version of the surface receptor the virus uses to enter human cells, angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). By flooding a culture of monkey-derived Vero cells with the drug, viral replication was reduced by a factor of 1000\u20135000. The researchers then showed that APN01 could inhibit viral replication in human blood vessel and kidney organoids (three-dimensional cell cultures derived from stem cells). By binding to and mopping up virus that would otherwise infect cells, the researchers think APN01 has promise in treating early-stage COVID-19 disease.As well as the surface receptor ACE2, SARS-CoV-2 needs co-factors to successfully infect cells. Findings from a small study of lung tissue cells from 16 people (initially collected as part of a lung cancer study) suggest that both ACE2 and the cofactor TMPRSS2 are highly expressed in progenitor cells that go on to form respiratory tract cells. The abundance of ACE2 proteins in these cells increased with age and seemed to be greater in men than women, reflecting the epidemiology of the disease, which seems to more seriously affect older people and more often men than women.In experiments in mice engineered to be susceptible to Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), researchers have identified a vaccine against the virus, noting that the vaccine strategy also holds promise against other dangerous coronaviruses. As a vector, the vaccine uses parainfluenza virus (PIV5) expressing the MERS-CoV envelope spike protein. One intranasal dose gave mice full protection against an otherwise lethal dose of MERS-CoV given 4 weeks after vaccination, mainly through T-cell-based immunity. The technology holds promise as an effective immunisation strategy because PIV5 can infect people without causing disease. A version of the vaccine to prevent disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 is being tested now.Like tiny football hooligans chanting at mounted police, mice infected with Toxoplasma gondii can be seen taunting cats. The parasite, which must pass back to the cat's gut to complete its lifecycle, interferes with the mouse's brain signaling to remove inhibition and normal survival instincts. People infected with T gondii have similar neuropsychiatric symptoms, as well as seizures. An electron microscopy study in brain tissue samples from people who had been infected showed that the chronic infection causes a loss of inhibitory synapses and an unsheathing of other neurons by microglia, with similar histological patterns seen in other psychiatric disorders.To preserve energy under stress\u2014be it from antibiotics or host immunity \u2014Staphylococcus aureus halts its production of proteins. To do this, it expresses a protein called ribosome silencing factor S (RSfS). However, due to the inherent difficulties in biologically producing a protein that itself halts protein production, researchers have not been able to to find out exactly how RSfS works. Using cryoelectron microscopy and X-ray diffraction methods, European researchers isolated and captured the protein in complex with the large subunit of the bacterial ribosome. The protein, it seems, stops the smaller ribosomal subunit from joining and forming functional ribosomes. Further understanding of this mechanism might lead to the development of new antibiotics.Findings from a new study have added weight to previous suggestions that people with sickle-cell anaemia have a lower risk of HIV infection than otherwise healthy people\u2014but it was unable to pin down the mechanistic explanation as to why. Researchers retrospectively reviewed data from an HIV transfusion risk study done in 1985\u201393 and confirmed that individuals with sickle-cell anaemia were indeed at lower risk of HIV infection. In further laboratory studies, they showed that CD4+ cells from people with sickle cell disease had less CCR5 (a key protein in HIV infection) and more CD4 protein than did cells form otherwise healthy people, but no increased susceptibility to HIV.A team of US mathematicians and computer scientists have proposed a new model to predict the spread of future infectious diseases. The model, based on how misinformation spreads and changes as it travels through populations, accounts for mutations in the pathogen as it passes from person to person and group to group\u2014and how it evolves in response to environmental conditions (eg, social distancing) and medical interventions. By contrast, say the scientists, traditional models do not account for such evolution and thus fall short of real-time usefulness. They say their model would allow public health practitioners dynamism when selecting interventions during an ongoing outbreak.", "S1473-30992030367-4": "Studies have shown that some patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and acute hypoxaemic respiratory failure have preserved lung compliance, suggesting that processes other than alveolar damage might be involved in hypoxaemia related to COVID-19 pneumonia.1\nThe typical imaging features of COVID-19 pneumonia, including peripheral ground-glass opacities with or without consolidation, are also non-specific and can be seen in many other diseases.2\nThere has been increasing attention on microvascular thrombi as a possible explanation for the severe hypoxaemia related to COVID-19.3\n,  4Dual-energy CT imaging can be used to characterise lung perfusion and is done as part of the standard protocol for imaging pulmonary embolism at our institution. Three patients with COVID-19, as confirmed by nasopharyngeal RT-PCR at our hospital, who did not have a history of smoking, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or other pulmonary conditions, underwent dual-energy CT imaging for elevated concentrations of D-dimer (>1000 ng/mL) and clinical suspicion of pulmonary emboli. Although no pulmonary emboli were observed in these individuals, we noted striking perfusion abnormalities that have not been previously described; in retrospect, at least nine other COVID-19 cases also shared these findings. In addition to the typical CT features of COVID-19 pneumonia,2\nwe observed considerable proximal and distal pulmonary vessel dilatation and tortuosity, predominately within, or surrounding, areas of lung opacities. Here, we present the first published images from dual-energy CT imaging of COVID-19 pneumonia that show profound vascular and perfusion abnormalities (figure; appendix).\nFigureDual-energy CT in a patient with COVID-19 pneumonia without evidence of pulmonary emboli\nShow full caption\nView Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Three major findings from dual-energy CT were observed on the images of pulmonary blood volume perfusion: preferentially increased perfusion of the lungs proximal to areas of lung opacity, decreased areas of peripheral perfusion corresponding to peripheral lung opacities, and a halo of increased perfusion surrounding peripheral areas of consolidation. The observed pulmonary vascular dilation might be due to relative failure of normal, physiological hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction in the setting of overactivation of a regional vasodilatation cascade as part of a dysfunctional and diffuse inflammatory process. Additionally, the mosaic perfusion pattern did not correspond to findings of bronchial wall thickening or secretions, making airway disease as the main underlying cause of hypoxaemia unlikely. Therefore, these perfusion abnormalities, combined with the pulmonary vascular dilation we observed, are suggestive of intrapulmonary shunting toward areas where gas exchange is impaired, resulting in a worsening ventilation\u2013perfusion mismatch and clinical hypoxia. Although peripheral opacities with hypoperfusion can be seen in pulmonary infarction, no pulmonary emboli were observed in any of the studies, and segmental increased perfusion to areas of infarction would be very atypical. Furthermore, a peripheral halo of increased perfusion has not been described in pulmonary infarction, but has been described once previously in a case of bacterial pneumonia.5\nHowever, blood and sputum cultures were negative in the three patients with COVID-19 at our hospital and did not suggest bacterial coinfection. It might be possible that the inflammatory response to COVID-19 resembles more of a bacterial infection than a viral infection. Overall, the combination of these imaging findings is novel for COVID-19 pneumonia.Treatment for acute respiratory failure in patients with COVID-19 is challenging in part because of little understanding of the underlying pathophysiology. Our findings are atypical for acute respiratory distress syndrome or thrombotic vascular disease and point to a possible central role for previously underappreciated pulmonary vascular shunting. More detailed assessments of vascular and perfusion changes in patients with COVID-19 are urgently needed.BPL reports royalties from Elsevier as a textbook author and editor, outside the submitted work.

The first case of COVID-19 in the Netherlands was confirmed on Feb 27, 2020, and the patient was put on mechanical ventilation in our ICU department at Erasmus Medical Center (Rotterdam, Netherlands). Currently, our department is the largest COVID-19 ICU in the Netherlands. We would like to share our findings regarding a possible mechanism of progressive respiratory failure.From the date of the first confirmed case up to April 5, a total of 90 patients were admitted to our ICU, most of whom were male (n=68 [76%]), of older age (mean age 62 years [SD 14]), and obese (mean body-mass index 29 kg/m2 [SD 5]). Treatment consisted of prone positioning, low tidal volumes, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) titration according to the higher PEEP, lower fraction of inspired oxygen table,1\nand restrictive fluid management. These methods resulted in low driving pressures, no pneumothoraxes, low vasopressor doses, and weaning from mechanical ventilation approximately 2 weeks after ICU admission. However, some patients (n=17 [19%]) deteriorated within 2 weeks and no longer responded to prone positioning. All of these patients had major pulmonary embolism established by lung CT or cardiac ultrasound.\u2022 View related content for this articleInitially, patients with COVID-19 on our ICU developed increased alveolar capillary permeability and subsequent interstitial oedema. The presence of oedema is illustrated by ground-glass opacities of the lung parenchyma on lung CT.2\nIf patients require mechanical ventilation, oxygenation improves following prone positioning, higher PEEP, and restrictive fluid management. Subsequently, their condition might deteriorate suddenly, and pulmonary embolism can occur, detected by contrast-enhanced lung CT scan.3\nOn our ICU, five further patients had progressive respiratory failure, in whom we did lung CT and found pulmonary embolism, either located centrally or segmentally, in all cases. In addition, we were confronted with these patients developing deep venous thrombosis, and frequent coagulation of renal replacement therapy filters. We hypothesise that the patients with COVID-19 with pulmonary embolism entered a hypercoagulable state with endothelial activation following an increase in proinflammatory cytokines.An association between increased coagulation status and increased capillary permeability might exist. A plasma D-dimer concentration greater than 4 \u03bcg/mL, combined with increasing inflammatory markers such as interleukin-6 (IL-6), and loss of response to prone positioning might be useful parameters to identify patients at risk of pulmonary embolism. Based on our early findings in our first 90 patients with COVID-19, we now include D-dimer and IL-6 in our routine laboratory tests in patients with COVID-19, and increase the prophylactic dose of low-molecular-weight heparin(nadroparin 5700 IU subcutaneously, from once a day to twice a day).4\nIn addition, we do a lung CT even at a low level of suspicion of pulmonary embolism, and we encourage others to do the same.In summary, COVID-19 might be associated with hypercoagulability, and clinicians should consider a pulmonary embolism in cases of progressive respiratory failure.DG has received speakers fees and travel expenses from Dr\u00e4ger, GE Healthcare (medical advisory board 2009\u201312), Maquet, and Novalung (medical advisory board 2015\u201318).

RT-PCR-based diagnostic confirmation of infected individuals is crucial to contain viral spread because infection can be asymptomatic despite high viral loads. Sufficient molecular diagnostic capacity is important for public health interventions such as case detection and isolation, including for health-care professionals.1Protocols for RNA RT-PCR testing of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) became available early in the pandemic, yet the infrastructure of testing laboratories is stretched and in some areas it is overwhelmed.2\nWe propose a testing strategy that is easy to implement and can expand the capacity of the available laboratory infrastructure and test kits when large numbers of asymptomatic people need to be screened. We introduced the pooling of samples before RT-PCR amplification, and only in the case of positive pool test results is work-up of individual samples initiated, thus potentially substantially reducing the number of tests needed.\u2022 View related content for this articleViral load during symptomatic infection with SARS-CoV-2 was investigated by Zou and colleagues.3\nTo analyse the effect of pooling samples on the sensitivity of RT-PCR, we compared cycle threshold (Ct) values of pools that tested positive with Ct values of individual samples that tested positive.We isolated RNA from eSwabs (Copan Italia, Brescia, Italy) using the NucliSens easy MAG Instrument (bioMeri\u00e9ux Deutschland, N\u00fcrtingen, Germany) following the manufacturers' instructions. PCR amplification used the RealStar SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR Kit 1.0 RUO (Altona Diagnostics, Hamburg, Germany) on a Light Cycler 480 II Real-Time PCR Instrument (Roche Diagnostics Deutschland, Mannheim, Germany) according to the manufacturers' instructions.Our results show that over a range of pool sizes, from four to 30 samples per pool, Ct values of positive pools were between 22 and 29 for the envelope protein gene (E-gene) assay and between 21 and 29 for the spike protein gene (S-gene) assay. Ct values were lower in retested positive individual samples (figure A, B). The Ct values for both E-gene and S-gene assays in pools and individual positive samples were below 30 and easily categorised as positive. Ct value differences between pooled tests and individual positive samples (Ctpool\u2013\u2008Ctpositive sample) were in the range of up to five. Even if Ct values of single samples were up to 34, positive pools could still be confidently identified (figure C, D). Sub-pools can further optimise resource use when infection prevalence is low. Generating a pool of 30 samples from three sub-pools of ten samples can reduce retestings. If the large pool is positive, the three sub-pools are reanalysed, and then the individual samples of the positive sub-pool. In our analyses during March 13\u201321, 2020, testing of 1191 samples required only 267 tests to detect 23 positive individuals (prevalence 1\u00b793%).

Although both viruses cause respiratory diseases and spread by contact and nose droplets, influenza has a shorter median incubation period than does severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Also, by contrast with influenza transmission, initial data for COVID-19 indicate that children are less affected than adults and that clinical attack rates in the 0\u201319 years age group are low. Fraser and colleagues used detailed H1N1 incidence data; by May 4, 2009, 11\u2008356 suspected and 822 laboratory-confirmed cases had been reported in Mexico.2\n,  3\n\n,  4\n\nBy contrast, Tuite and colleagues based their conclusion on three reported cases in Egypt by March 6.1\nThe scarcity of data available to the authors, as stated in their Correspondence, does not allow for the use of an appropriate modelling technique to estimate the burden of an epidemic.\u2022 View related content for this articleAlternatively, Tuite and colleagues should have considered potential reasons for the low number of COVID-19 cases in Egypt, such as the considerable effort the Egyptian government has made to effectively control the outbreak. On March 25, a team of experts from WHO concluded a COVID-19 technical mission in Egypt. Yvan Hutin, director for communicable diseases in WHO's regional office and mission team lead, stated that \u201cafter several days of intensive meetings and field visits both inside and outside Cairo, we see that Egypt is making substantial efforts to control COVID-19 outbreak. Significant work is being done, especially in the areas of early detection, laboratory testing, isolation, contact tracing and referral of patients.\u201d Hutin referred to the existing pattern of transmission as local rather than community and agreed with local authorities on additional measures to further slowdown COVID-19 spread.5\n\nThe report listed the various steps that have been made by the Egyptian Government\u2014namely, allocating additional dedicated human and financial resources needed to contain the outbreak, expanding the number of peripheral laboratories that are able to test for SARS-CoV-2, and with support from WHO and other partners, increasing testing capacity (Egypt now has the capacity to do up to 200\u2008000 tests).5\n\nThe report also commended Egypt's strong disease surveillance system and contact-tracing efforts as the main reasons behind the successful management of sporadic and clusters of cases before they spread.5Another potential explanation for the low number of COVID-19 cases in Egypt is the mandatory\u2014and free of charge\u2014vaccination against tuberculosis with the BCG vaccine. The immune response-boosting effect of this vaccine has been postulated to potentially protect against SARS-CoV-2 infection, given that it has been shown to be effective against similar viruses. In March, a multicentre, phase 3, randomised clinical trial in Australia endorsed by WHO was fast tracked to investigate whether the BCG vaccine can protect against SARS-CoV-2.6\n\nThis trial aims to enrol 4000 health-care workers from hospitals in Australia in the next few weeks and should allow assessment of whether BCG vaccine can lessen the severity of COVID-19 symptoms.6Finally, evolving data continue to support the slow spread of COVID-19 in Egypt.

RT-PCR was done in nasopharyngeal swabs from symptomatic patients and contacts of confirmed cases traced in the preceding 2 weeks. In patients with a high rate of suspicion, the test was repeated after 48 h.

However, when attempting to estimate Egypt's burden of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) by studying exported cases, Ashleigh Tuite and colleagues1\nestablished neither independence nor absence of bias for the cases used in their study. This approach is especially problematic in the light of widespread news of a tourist cruise ship in Egypt exporting COVID-19 across the world through hundreds of tourists who were onboard during the timeframe used by Tuite and colleagues in their Correspondence.Regarding sample independence, the authors used two scenarios to estimate the number of COVID-19 cases in Egypt: one with 14 cases and another assuming dependence between some of these cases and hence reducing the number of cases used to five. For the more conservative scenario, Tuite and colleagues estimated Egypt to have 19\u2008310 cases (95% CI 6270\u201345\u2008070) at the time. However, they acknowledged the cruise ship situation and revised their estimate to \u201cnear 6000 cases\u201d. However, no analytical basis for this revision was given. For example, if all five cases considered were related to the cruise ship, this would amount to one single case and lead to a different model with a different estimate and different error margins.\u2022 View related content for this articleRegarding sample bias, if all cases in Tuite and colleagues' analysis were indeed related to the cruise ship, then the sample used would be very biased and thus invalid. Egypt has US$2549 of GDP per capita. Therefore, most Egyptians do not have the disposable income to spend on an upscale Nile cruise. Finally, Tuite and colleagues' most conservative estimate is close to 6000 cases by the end of their analysis (March 6, 2020). From March 6 to the date of publication (March 26), 20 days passed. COVID-19's case-count growth rate has been roughly doubling every 3 days in many countries that have lower population density and are more developed than Egypt.2\n\nAssuming that the number of cases grows at the same rate of doubling every 3 days, Egypt would have had about 640\u2008000 cases by March 26, a time when the whole world had just 593\u2008300 cases reported.3\n\nThat is an extraordinary claim.

We would like to reiterate that the number of confirmed cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in every country worldwide (Egypt included) is an underestimate of the true burden of illness, regardless of the screening programmes in place. Although we are aware that all modelling studies have limitations, we believe that it is important to rely on multiple sources of information to have a more accurate reflection of the so-called ground truth. For example, as of April 12, 2020, Egypt has reported 146 COVID-19-related deaths,1\n\nand as with reported cases, reported deaths are also an underestimate of the true value. By use of mortality data (both retrospectively and in real-time), other models2\n\nhave corroborated our findings and still predict a much larger outbreak than that currently reported in Egypt.

First, the authors used data from the UN World Tourism Organization (UNWTO) on the average length of stay in Egypt by tourists (11\u00b76 days), which is not accurate for the following reasons: we contacted UNWTO to verify the most recent estimates, and the average length of stay by tourists in Egypt was 11\u00b76 days in 2018, 7\u00b778 days in 2017, 6\u00b71 days in 2016, 9 days in 2015, and 10 days in 2014, with no estimates available for February, 2020; the UNWTO estimates combine the length of stays of domestic and international tourists, including visitors from several countries other than the USA, Canada, France, and Taiwan; and for Egypt, a country with rapid changes in the political, economic, and tourism fields, it would be inaccurate to confidently consider these incomplete statistical data for the present model of February, 2020. Second, Tuite and colleagues' model assumes that the population mixing in Egypt is equally likely between Egyptian residents and tourists and that tourists and Egyptian residents are at equal risk of infection, which is not correct for the following reasons: Egyptian population demographics are different from those of the USA, Canada, France, and Taiwan, particularly regarding life expectancy and population age groups, a well known risk factor for symptomatic COVID-19 infections; and Egypt is an agricultural country, with tourism destinations in Egypt, as reported on the official website of the ministry of tourism, being related to either Ancient Egypt or the coastal areas.3\n\nMost tourism destinations are in special locations far away from residential places and have low population densities. Therefore, we cannot assume that population mixing in Egypt is equally likely between Egyptian residents and tourists because several high-density residential cities do not have tourists.Third, Tuite and colleagues' model focused on 1 month, from Feb 6 to March 6, 2020. By Feb 6, the four countries (USA, Canada, France, and Taiwan) had officially reported a total of 36 confirmed COVID-19 cases (table). Therefore, we cannot rule out the opposite possibility that some of these COVID-19 cases were infected before arriving in Egypt. What makes this scenario possible is that Egyptian authorities applied COVID-19 airport screening for travellers from China alone but not from other countries, owing to insufficient resources (as reported by the WHO office in Egypt). Another observation is that most of the early confirmed Egyptian cases were reported in Luxor and Aswan, two major tourism destinations in Egypt.\nTableDate and travel history of the first confirmed COVID-19 case in the USA, Canada, France, and Taiwan\nDate Travel history Total number of confirmed COVID-19 cases until Feb 6, 2020\nUSA Jan 20, 2020 Returned from Wuhan, China 12\nCanada Jan 27, 2020 Returned from Wuhan, China 5\nFrance Jan 24, 2020 Returned from China 6\nTaiwan Jan 21, 2020 Returned from China 13\nTotal .. .. 36\nCOVID-19=coronavirus disease 2019.\nOpen table in a new tabCOVID-19=coronavirus disease 2019.\u2022 View related content for this articleOn the basis of these points, I argue that Tuite and colleagues' model is not accurate and might not be suitable to estimate the burden of COVID-19 in Egypt.

To dissect the drivers of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) transmission, the authors modelled PCR-confirmed infections in 391 cases and 1286 of their close contacts from Jan 14 to Feb 12, 2020.1Shenzhen is an interesting location to study the dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 because it was affected early in the pandemic and reacted quickly.2\nStrict case isolation, contact tracing, and social distancing measures kept the transmission rate near the epidemic threshold throughout the study period.2\nBi and colleagues report that most secondary infections occurred in the household (77 of 81), with a secondary attack rate estimated at 11\u00b72% (95% CI 9\u00b71\u201313\u00b78) among household contacts.1\nThis figure should be considered an underestimate of the unmitigated household attack rate of SARS-CoV-2, since transmission chains were cut short in Shenzhen because of strict control measures. Index cases detected by symptom-based surveillance were isolated outside of the home on average 4\u00b76 days (95% CI 4\u00b71\u20135\u00b70) after symptom onset. Furthermore, individuals identified via contact tracing were isolated or quarantined outside of the home on average 2\u00b77 days (95% CI 2\u00b71\u20133\u00b73) after symptom onset.1\nConsequently, the serial interval of SARS-CoV-2 in Shenzhen (mean estimate 6\u00b73 days; 95% CI 5\u00b72\u20137\u00b76) should be considered a lower bound and would probably increase in less successfully controlled outbreaks.\u2022 View related content for this articleThe age profile of PCR-confirmed infections in Shenzhen indicates that children are as susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection as adults, although they are less likely to display symptoms.1\nThe distinctive age profile of COVID-19 severity has been noted very early on in the pandemic,3\nalthough the biological mechanisms at play remain unclear. In the Shenzhen data, the authors noted no difference in the transmission potential of SARS-CoV-2 from children or adults.1\nThis is in contrast to pandemic influenza virus, which is more easily transmitted by children. It will be useful to confirm the age profile of SARS-CoV-2 transmissibility with data from other locations and serological surveys, which capture more infections than PCR. Age-specific susceptibility, infectivity, and severity are important factors to get right to project the impact of school closures on SARS-CoV-2 dynamics and disease burden. School closures exert a substantial economic toll on societies and maintaining these interventions for long periods of time requires robust supportive evidence.As would be expected from a well controlled outbreak, the mean R in Shenzhen was very low, at 0\u00b74,1\nsubstantially reduced from a baseline non-intervention value of 2\u00b70\u20134\u00b70.4\nThis aligns with the strict interventions implemented in this city. However, the mean R does not tell the full story. There is evidence of transmission heterogeneity with SARS-CoV-2, with 10% of cases accounting for 90% of transmission.1\nSuch a high level of heterogeneity is consistent with, if a little more extreme than, that of SARS-coronavirus (SARS-CoV), and more pronounced than for other directly transmitted respiratory viruses such as measles or influenza.5\nBeyond the intensity of contacts, there is no clear factor in the Shenzhen data that could explain the high transmission potential of some infections. Further research into the biological (eg, shedding and symptoms) and social factors (eg, type of contacts and environment) that drive transmission heterogeneity is warranted to guide more targeted interventions against SARS-CoV-2.Armed with their descriptive findings, Bi and colleagues go on to simulate the impact of case isolation and contact tracing on SARS-CoV-2 dynamics.1\nThey consider a range of possible durations for the infectious period of SARS-CoV-2, which is reasonable given the scarcity of data on this figure. They show that for a given R, the longer the infectious period, the more easily the epidemic can be brought under control with case-based interventions. This is because case isolation reduces the full transmission potential of each case, particularly if the infectious period is long and cases can be isolated 2\u20135 days after symptom onset. Furthermore, Bi and colleagues show that contact-based interventions are more efficient than case-based interventions to reduce transmission, since infected contacts are typically isolated earlier in their infection history than index cases. This worthwhile modelling exercise highlights the urgent need for more information about the infectious period of SARS-CoV-2.However, there is an important caveat in this modelling work: the potential for pre-symptomatic and asymptomatic transmission is not considered. As a result, the conclusion that case-based or contact-based interventions alone could bring the epidemic under control for longer durations of the infectious period is optimistic, and contrasts with previous simulation studies.6\nViral shedding studies and epidemiological investigations suggest that in the household, around 40% of transmission occurs before symptom onset, the live virus is shed for at least 1 week after symptom onset, and there is high shedding in asymptomatic individuals.7\n,  8\n,  9\nCrucially, the effectiveness of case isolation and contact tracing will depend on the fraction of transmission originating from asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic individuals.9As we look towards post-lockdown strategies, we should examine the experience of countries that have successfully controlled SARS-CoV2 transmission or have low mortality (eg, China, Singapore, Taiwan, South Korea, Germany, and Iceland). Successful strategies include ample testing and contact tracing, supplemented by moderate forms of social distancing.10\nContact tracing on the scale that is needed for the SARS-CoV-2 response is labour intensive, and imperfect if done manually. Hence new technology-based approaches are greatly needed to assist in identification of contacts, especially if case detection is aggressive.9\nBuilding on the SARS-CoV-2 experience in Shenzhen and other settings, we contend that enhanced case finding and contact tracing should be part of the long-term response to this pandemic\u2014this can get us most of the way towards control.9View Large Image\nCopyright \u00a9 2020 Flickr - Jay Sterling AustinWe declare no competing interests.

COVID-19 is characterised by fever, cough, fatigue, shortness of breath, pneumonia, and other respiratory tract symptoms,2\n,  3\n,  4\nand in many cases progresses to death. As of April 15, 2020, there have been 1\u2008914\u2008916 confirmed cases and 123\u2008010 deaths reported worldwide.5\n\nMost cases were initially confined to Hubei province in China, but there has since been substantial spread not only elsewhere in China but worldwide. A rapid and robust response by the global scientific community has described many important aspects of SARS-CoV-2 transmission and natural history,1\n,  2\n,  6\n,  7\n,  8\nbut key questions remain.If well tracked, early introductions of an emerging pathogen provide a unique opportunity to characterise its transmission, natural history, and the effectiveness of screening. Careful monitoring of cases and low probability of infection from the general community enables inferences, important to modelling the course of the outbreak, that are difficult to make during a widely disseminated epidemic. In particular, we can make assumptions about when and where cases were likely to have been infected that are impossible when the pathogen is widespread. Furthermore, during these early phases, uninfected and asymptomatic contacts are often closely tracked, providing important information about transmission and natural history. Combined, these data on early introductions can be used to give insights into the natural history of the disease,9\ntransmission characteristics,10\nand the unseen burden of infection.11Research in context\nEvidence before this study\nThe emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been accompanied by a substantial increase in research and publications ranging from transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 to clinical characteristics of the infection. As of March 23, 2020, our search of PubMed using keywords (\u201cCOVID-19\u201d OR \u201cSARS-nCoV-2\u201d OR \u201cnovel coronavirus\u201d) AND (\u201cserial interval\u201d OR \u201cincubation period\u201d OR \u201cattack rate\u201d) yielded 14 articles that have estimated either the serial interval or incubation period of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and one that investigated the secondary attack rate. However, most of these estimates have come from either Wuhan or publicly available case data; in both instances, incomplete capture of infections and cases might have produced biased estimates.\nAdded value of this study\nThis study is, to our knowledge, the first analysis of SARS-CoV-2 transmission and COVID-19 natural history based on a large primary dataset of cases and close contacts, for which the mode of surveillance (ie, symptom-based versus contact-based) was sufficiently documented and RT-PCR testing was nearly universal. We present one of the first estimates of the serial interval, secondary household attack rate, and dispersion (ie, tendency towards super spreading) for SARS-CoV-2 based on active surveillance data. We found that the attack rate does not differ significantly by age, with on average 7% of close contacts becoming infected, around 80% of these contacts showing any symptoms, and 3% of infections manifesting severe disease at initial assessment. We also found that contact-based surveillance in Shenzhen reduced the duration an infected individual transmits in the community by 2 days. These findings are important for understanding the burden of COVID-19 and for strategic planning across the world.\nImplications of all the available evidence\nThese results shed further light on how SARS-CoV-2 is transmitting, how severe it is, and how effective control measures can be in specific contexts. We provide a key piece of evidence supporting intensive contact tracing and highlighting that children might be an important target for interventions aimed at reducing transmission, even if they do not get sick.Evidence before this studyThe emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been accompanied by a substantial increase in research and publications ranging from transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 to clinical characteristics of the infection.

We provide a key piece of evidence supporting intensive contact tracing and highlighting that children might be an important target for interventions aimed at reducing transmission, even if they do not get sick.Here, we use data collected by the Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention (Shenzhen CDC) on 391 cases of COVID-19 and 1286 of their close contacts to characterise key aspects of its epidemiology outside of Hubei province. We characterise differences in demographics and severity between cases identified through symptom-based surveillance and monitoring of close case contacts, and estimate the time to key events, such as confirmation, isolation, and recovery. Using data from contact tracing, we characterise SARS-CoV-2 transmission by estimating key values, such as the household secondary attack rate, serial interval, and observed reproductive number (R).On Jan 8, 2020, Shenzhen CDC identified the first case of pneumonia with unknown cause and began monitoring travellers from Hubei province for symptoms of COVID-19. Over the next 2 weeks this surveillance programme expanded to include travellers from Hubei regardless of symptoms, patients at local hospitals, and individuals detected by fever screening in neighbourhoods and at local clinics. Suspected cases and close contacts were tested for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR of nasal swabs at 28 qualified local hospitals, ten district-level CDCs, and two third-party testing organisations, with final confirmation done at the Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention (Guangdong CDC) or Shenzhen CDC (appendix 2 p 11). Close contacts were identified through contact tracing of a confirmed case and were defined as those who lived in the same apartment, shared a meal, travelled, or socially interacted with an index case 2 days before symptom onset. Casual contacts (eg, other clinic patients) and some close contacts (eg, nurses) who wore a mask during exposure were not included in this group.Symptomatic cases were isolated and treated at designated hospitals regardless of RT-PCR test results. Asymptomatic individuals who tested positive were quarantined at centralised facilities. Close contacts and travellers from Hubei who tested negative were quarantined at home or a central facility, and monitored for 14 days. RT-PCR testing was required for all close contacts at the beginning of isolation, and release was conditional on a negative RT-PCR result. Basic demographics, signs and symptoms, clinical severity, and exposure history were recorded for all confirmed cases.Here, we analyse confirmed cases identified by the Shenzhen CDC between Jan 14 and Feb 12, 2020, and close contacts of cases confirmed before Feb 9, 2020.This work was done in support of an ongoing public health response, and hence was determined not to be human subjects research after consultation with the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health institutional review board. Data collection is part of the continuing public health investigation of an emerging outbreak and therefore the individual informed consent was waived. The study was approved by the ethics committees of Shenzhen CDC. Analytical datasets were constructed in an anonymised manner, and all analysis of personally identifiable data took place onsite at the Shenzhen CDC.We defined symptom-based surveillance to include symptomatic screening at airport and train stations, community fever monitoring, home observation of recent travellers to Hubei, and testing of patients admitted to hospital. Contact-based surveillance is the identification of cases through monitoring and testing of close contacts of confirmed cases, independently of their symptom presentation. By protocol, those in the contact-based group were tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection regardless of symptoms, whereas those in the other categories were tested only if they showed signs or symptoms of disease.At the first clinical assessment, data were recorded on 21 signs and symptoms (appendix 2 p 1), and disease severity was assessed. Cases with fever, respiratory symptoms, and radiographic evidence of pneumonia were classified as having moderate symptoms. Cases were classified as having severe symptoms if they had any of the following: breathing rate 30 breaths per min or higher; oxygen saturation level 93% or lower at rest; oxygen concentration level PaO2/FiO2 (ratio of arterial oxygen partial pressure to fractional inspired oxygen) 300 mm Hg (1 mm Hg=0\u00b7133 kPa) or lower; lung infiltrates higher than 50% within 24\u201348 h; respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation; septic shock; or multiple organ dysfunction or failure. All other symptomatic cases were classified as mild.Relationships between demographics, mode of detection, and symptom severity were assessed and characterised with \u03c72 tests, and simple and multiple logistic regression.Distributions were fit to the timing of key events in each confirmed case's course of infection and treatment. The time from infection to symptom onset (incubation period) was assumed to be log-normally distributed and estimated as previously described.12\n,  13\n,  14\nWe determined the left and right boundaries on the possible exposure and symptom onset times. Cases who recently travelled to Hubei were assumed to have been exposed while there. Cases without a recent travel history but with exposure to a confirmed case were assumed to be exposed from the time of earliest to latest possible contact with that case. Only cases for whom we could identify the earliest and latest possible time of exposure and who had a date of symptom onset were included in the analysis.Time between symptom onset and recovery was estimated by use of parametric survival methods. Patients who had not recovered were considered to be censored on Feb 22, 2020, or at the time of death. All other delay distributions were estimated by directly fitting parametric distributions to time between symptom onset or arrival in Shenzhen, and confirmation, isolation, or admission to hospital. Confidence intervals were calculated with bootstrapping or standard parametric estimators.15Transmission was characterised by examining the relationship between confirmed cases and their infected and uninfected close contacts. The household secondary attack rate was calculated as the percentage of household contacts (those sharing a room, apartment, or other sleeping arrangement) who were later confirmed to have SARS-CoV-2 infection. The distribution of serial intervals (the time between symptom onset in the confirmed case and their infected contacts) was calculated by fitting parametric distributions to the time of symptom onset in clear case\u2013contact pairs. The mean R and distribution of individual reproductive numbers (ie, the number of secondary infections caused by each case) were calculated from the number of secondary infections observed among close contacts of each index case, with ambiguities resolved through multiple imputation (appendix 2 p 11). The relative odds of transmission among contacts of various types were estimated by use of conditional logistic regression and random-effects models, to account for differing numbers of possible infected individuals in each risk group. When assessing the impact of characteristics of infected individuals, we only included risk sets where a single potential infected individual was clearly identifiable. Confidence intervals were estimated by use of bootstrapping or standard parametric approaches.The sponsor of the study had no role in study design, data collection, data analysis, data interpretation, or writing of the report. Shenzhen CDC had full access to all the data in the study, and all corresponding authors share the final responsibility for the decision to submit for publication.Between Jan 14 and Feb 12, 2020, the Shenzhen CDC confirmed 391 cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection (table 1). Of 379 with a known mode of detection, 292 (77%) were detected through symptom-based surveillance. Overall, there were approximately equal numbers of male and female cases (187 vs 204). The mean age of the population was 45 years, and 307 (79%) of 391 cases were adults aged 30\u201369 years. At the time of first clinical assessment, most cases were mild (102 [26%] of 391) or moderate (254 [65%] of 391), and only 35 (9%) were severe. 330 (84%) of 391 cases had fever at the time of initial assessment, while 25 (6%) of 391 had no signs or symptoms. As of Feb 22, 2020, final clinical outcomes were known for 228 of 391 cases in our data, with three who had died (all captured through symptom-based surveillance) and 225 who had recovered.\nTable 1Demographic and clinical characteristics of cases by contact-based versus symptom-based surveillance\nContact-based surveillance (n=87) Symptom-based surveillance (n=292) Unknown or other (n=12) Total (n=391) p value\nSex\nFemale 63 (72%) 131 (45%) 10 (83%) 204 (52%) <0\u00b70001\nMale 24 (28%) 161 (55%) 2 (17%) 187 (48%) ..\nAge\n0\u20139 years 13 (15%) 6 (2%) 1 (8%) 20 (5%) <0\u00b70001\n10\u201319 years 5 (6%) 6 (2%) 1 (8%) 12 (3%) ..\n20\u201329 years 11 (13%) 23 (8%) 0 (0%) 34 (9%) ..\n30\u201339 years 15 (17%) 71 (24%) 1 (8%) 87 (22%) ..\n40\u201349 years 9 (10%) 49 (17%) 2 (17%) 60 (15%) ..\n50\u201359 years 10 (12%) 63 (22%) 1 (8%) 74 (19%) ..\n60\u201369 years 20 (23%) 60 (21%) 6 (50%) 86 (22%) ..\n\u226570 years 4 (5%) 14 (5%) 0 (0%) 18 (5%) ..\nSeverity\nMild 18 (21%) 82 (28%) 2 (17%) 102 (26%) 0\u00b703\nModerate 66 (76%) 180 (62%) 8 (67%) 254 (65%) ..\nSevere 3 (3%) 30 (10%) 2 (17%) 35 (9%) ..\nSymptomatic\nNo 17 (20%) 8 (3%) 0 (0%) 25 (6%) <0\u00b70001\nYes 70 (80%) 284 (97%) 12 (100%) 366 (94%) ..\nFever\nNo 25 (29%) 34 (12%) 2 (17%) 61 (16%) 0\u00b70002\nYes 62 (71%) 258 (88%) 10 (83%) 330 (84%) ..\nOpen table in a new tabA larger proportion of cases detected through symptom-based surveillance were male (161 [55%] of 292 vs 24 [28%] of 87) and aged 20\u201369 years (266 [91%] of 292 vs 65 [75%] of 87) than were those detected through contact-based surveillance (Table 1, Table 2).

The probability of severe symptoms increased slightly with age, although only individuals aged 60\u201369 years had a significantly increased risk compared with the reference category, individuals aged 50\u201359 years (OR 3\u00b74 [95% 1\u00b74\u20139\u00b75]).Based on 183 cases with a well defined period of exposure and symptom onset (appendix 2 p 8), we estimated the median incubation period for COVID-19 to be 4\u00b78 days (95% CI 4\u00b72\u20135\u00b74; figure 1, appendix 2 p 2), and estimated that 95% of those who develop symptoms will do so within 14\u00b70 days (95% CI 12\u00b72\u201315\u00b79) of infection. We estimated that about 5\u00b70% of cases who develop symptoms would not show symptoms until 14 days after infection.\nFigure 1Incubation period and serial interval of COVID-19\nShow full caption\nView Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Based on 228 cases with known outcomes, we estimated that median time to recovery was 20\u00b78 days (95% CI 20\u00b71\u201321\u00b75). We estimated that the median time to recovery was 22\u00b74 days (95% CI 20\u00b78\u201324\u00b71) in individuals aged 50\u201359 years, and was estimated to be significantly shorter in younger adults (eg, 19\u00b72 days in individuals aged 20\u201329 years; appendix 2 pp 3, 10). In multiple regression models including sex, age, baseline severity, and method of detection, in addition to age, baseline severity was associated with time to recovery (appendix 2 p 3). Compared to cases with mild symptoms, those with severe symptoms had a 41% (95% CI 24\u201360) longer time to recovery (appendix 2 p 3). As of Feb 22, 2020, three cases had died. These deaths occurred 35\u201344 days from symptom onset and 27\u201333 days from confirmation.Cases detected through symptom-based surveillance were confirmed on average 5\u00b75 days (95% CI 5\u00b70\u20135\u00b79) after symptom onset (figure 2, appendix 2 p 2), whereas those detected by contact-based surveillance were confirmed on average 3\u00b72 days (95% CI 2\u00b77\u20133\u00b78) after symptom onset. 17 (5%) of 342 cases with a known onset date and start date of quarantine were isolated before developing symptoms. Among those isolated after developing symptoms, the symptom-based surveillance group was, on average, isolated 4\u00b76 days (95% CI 4\u00b71\u20135\u00b70) after symptom onset, whereas the contact-based surveillance group was isolated 2\u00b77 days (2\u00b71\u20133\u00b73) after symptom onset. Hence, contact-based surveillance was associated with a 2\u00b73-day (95% CI 1\u00b75\u20133\u00b70) decrease in time to confirmation and a 1\u00b79-day (1\u00b71\u20132\u00b77) decrease in time to isolation. The mean time between symptom onset and admission to hospital was similar to time between symptom onset and isolation in both the symptom-based and contact-based surveillance groups (figure 2, appendix 2 p 2).\nFigure 2Time between symptom onset and SARS-CoV-2 confirmation (A), admission to hospital (B), and isolation among cases (C) detected by contact-based and symptom-based surveillance\nShow full caption\nView Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)191 (64%) of 298 travellers developed symptoms after arriving in Shenzhen, with a mean time from arrival to symptom onset of 4\u00b79 days (95% CI 4\u00b72\u20135\u00b75; appendix 2 p 2). Those developing symptoms before arrival or on the day of arrival were confirmed as cases on average 4\u00b75 days (95% CI 3\u00b78\u20135\u00b71) after arrival, and isolated on average 3\u00b71 days (2\u00b75\u20133\u00b77) after arrival.Overall, 1286 close contacts were identified for index cases testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 between Jan 14 and Feb 9, 2020, with 244 (84%) of 292 cases having at least one close contact. 622 (95%) of 653 close contacts with known dates for the period when they were under quarantine were followed up for 12 days or longer. 98 of the close contacts tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection by RT-PCR, and one had presumptive infection. Assuming those with a missing test result were uninfected, we found that the secondary attack rate was 11\u00b72% (95% CI 9\u00b71\u201313\u00b78) among household contacts and 6\u00b76% (5\u00b74\u20138\u00b71) overall (the secondary attack rate increased to 14\u00b79% [12\u00b71\u201318\u00b72] among household contacts and 9\u00b77% [7\u00b79\u201311\u00b78] overall if those with missing results were removed from the denominator). In multiple conditional logistic regression analysis of contact types, household contact (OR 6\u00b73; 95% CI 1\u00b75\u201326\u00b73) and travelling together (OR 7\u00b71; 1\u00b74\u201334\u00b79) were significantly associated with infection (table 3). Reporting contact that occurred often was also associated with increased risk of infection compared with moderate-frequency contact (OR 8\u00b78; 95% CI 2\u00b76\u201330\u00b71; table 3).\nTable 3Group-specific attack rates and risk factors for SAR-CoV-2 infection among close contacts\nNumber of cases*\nNumber infected Attack rate (95% CI) Univariate regression Multivariate regression\nOdds ratio 2\u00b75% 97\u00b75% Odds ratio 2\u00b75% 97\u00b75%\nSex\nFemale 558 58 10\u00b74% (8\u00b71\u201313\u00b72) Ref .. .. .. .. ..\nMale 486 26 5\u00b73% (3\u00b77\u20137\u00b77) 0\u00b743 0\u00b721 0\u00b786 .. .. ..\nAge\n0\u20139 years 148 11 7\u00b74% (4\u00b72\u201312\u00b78) 2\u00b733 0\u00b738 14\u00b705 .. .. ..\n10\u201319 years 85 6 7\u00b71% (3\u00b73\u201314\u00b76) 3\u00b750 0\u00b753 23\u00b724 .. .. ..\n20\u201329 years 114 7 6\u00b71% (3\u00b70\u201312\u00b71) 4\u00b791 0\u00b774 32\u00b764 .. .. ..\n30\u201339 years 268 16 6\u00b70% (3\u00b77\u20139\u00b75) 1\u00b784 0\u00b734 9\u00b780 .. .. ..\n40\u201349 years 143 7 4\u00b79% (2\u00b74\u20139\u00b78) 3\u00b746 0\u00b755 21\u00b792 .. .. ..\n50\u201359 years 110 10 9\u00b71% (5\u00b70\u201315\u00b79) Ref .. .. .. .. ..\n60\u201369 years 130 20 15\u00b74% (10\u00b72\u201322\u00b76) 5\u00b768 1\u00b701 32\u00b709 .. .. ..\n\u226570 years 72 7 9\u00b77% (4\u00b78\u201318\u00b77) 4\u00b726 0\u00b764 28\u00b744 .. .. ..\nContact type: household\nNo 456 4 0\u00b79% (0\u00b73\u20132\u00b72) Ref .. ..

Inf=infinity.Attack rates were similar across all age categories of infected contacts (table 3), although we observed some indication of elevated attack rates in older age groups (figure 3). Notably, the rate of infection in children younger than 10 years (7\u00b74%) was similar to the population average (6\u00b76%). There was no significant association between probability of infection and age of the index case. Surprisingly, in univariate analysis a longer time in the community before isolation was associated with a reduced risk of causing infections (data not shown). However, this association was no longer significant after adjusting for contact frequency and type.\nFigure 3Attack rate among close contacts, baseline severity, and proportion of cases without fever at initial assessment by age group\nShow full caption\nView Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Based on 48 pairs of cases with a clear relationship between the index case and secondary case and time of symptom onset, we estimated that the serial interval is gamma distributed with a mean of 6\u00b73 days (95% CI 5\u00b72\u20137\u00b76) and an SD of 4\u00b72 days (95% CI 3\u00b71\u20135\u00b73; figure 1B, appendix 2 p 2). Hence, 95% of secondary cases were expected to develop symptoms within 14\u00b73 days (95% CI 11\u00b71\u201317\u00b76) of their infector. This estimate includes the effect of isolation on truncating the serial interval. Stratified results show that if the infected individual was isolated less than 3 days after infection the average serial interval was 3\u00b76 days, increasing to 8\u00b71 days if the infected individual was isolated on the third day after symptom onset or later (appendix 2 p 3).The mean number of secondary cases caused by each index case (ie, the observed reproductive number, R), was 0\u00b74 (95% CI 0\u00b73\u20130\u00b75). The distribution of individual R values was highly over-dispersed, with 80% of infections being caused by 8\u00b79% (95% CI 3\u00b75\u201310\u00b78) of cases (negative binomial dispersion parameter 0\u00b758; 95% CI 0\u00b735\u20131\u00b718).We examined the potential impact of surveillance and isolation through truncating the infectious period. Because of the scarce understanding of infectious periods following SARS-CoV-2 infection, we considered a range of possible infectious periods where infectiousness varies over time and follows a gamma distribution (appendix 2 p 11). We defined the mean infectious day (ie, the average number of days after symptom onset that an infected individual is expected to infect a secondary case) as the weighted mean of the infectious period, where each day is weighted by relative infectiousness. We considered periods where the mean infectious day is less than 15 days after symptom onset (roughly the period of SARS and early SARS-CoV-2 reports),16\n,  17\nand assumed that R0=2\u00b76 and that isolation effectively ends the infectious period. Under these assumptions we found that if the mean infectious day is greater than 5 days, then it might be possible to bring R below one in cases detected by symptom-based surveillance, and the same can be accomplished by contact-based surveillance if the mean infectious day is greater than 3 days (appendix 2 p 9). For the impact of passive surveillance alone to achieve our observed R of 0\u00b74, we projected that the mean infectious day must be at least 5\u00b75 days (and likely greater) after symptom onset.Even if transmission is completely eliminated in the group captured by surveillance (eg, if we could get perfect surveillance on the day of symptom onset), assuming R0=2\u00b76, the cases captured by surveillance must, if not isolated, be expected to cause 61% of onward transmission to achieve local elimination by surveillance and isolation alone (appendix 2 p 9).This analysis of early SARS-CoV-2 cases and their close contacts in Shenzhen, China, provides insight into the natural history, transmission, and control of this disease. The values estimated provide the evidentiary foundation for predicting the impact of this virus, evaluating control measures, and guiding the global response. Analyses of how cases are detected, and use of data on individuals exposed but not infected, indicate that infection rates in young children are not lower than the population average (even if rates of clinical disease are). We were able to directly estimate important transmission parameters, and show that, at least among observed contacts, transmission rates are low. Estimates of the distribution of time between symptom onset and case isolation by surveillance type reveal that heightened surveillance combined with case isolation could plausibly account for these low rates of transmission. These results paint a positive picture of the impact of heightened surveillance and isolation in Shenzhen. However, uncertainty in the number of asymptomatic cases missed by surveillance and their ability to transmit SARS-CoV-2 must temper any hopes of stopping the COVID-19 pandemic by these measures.This work further supports the understanding of COVID-19 as a disease with a fairly short incubation period (mean 4\u20136 days) but a long clinical course,2\n,  7\n,  18\nwith patients taking many weeks to die or recover. Notably, however, we estimate a higher proportion of cases taking 14 days or more to develop symptoms (5%) than estimated in the study by Lauer and colleagues (1%).6Focusing on cases detected through contact-based surveillance adds nuance to previous characterisations of COVID-19. Since RT-PCR testing of contacts is near universal, we can assume these cases are more reflective of the average SARS-CoV-2 infection than cases detected through symptomatic surveillance. In the contact-based surveillance group, any tendency for cases to be male or older (beyond the underlying population distribution) disappears. Furthermore, in this group, 20% of cases were asymptomatic at the time of first clinical assessment and nearly 30% did not have a fever. This observation is consistent with a reasonably high rate of asymptomatic carriage, but lower than that suggested by some modelling studies,19\nalthough RT-PCR has imperfect sensitivity.20In Shenzhen, SARS-CoV-2 transmission most probably occurred between very close contacts, such as individuals sharing a household. However, even in this group fewer than one in six contacts (ie, secondary attack rate 11\u201315%) were infected, and overall we observed far fewer than one (0\u00b74) onward transmission per primary case. As noted above, low transmission levels might in part be due to the impact of isolation and surveillance, but it is equally likely that unobserved transmission has some role. We also estimated reasonably high rates of overdispersion in the number of cases caused by each infected individual, leaving open the possibility that large COVID-19 clusters can occur even if surveillance and isolation are forcing R below one\u2014events that could potentially overwhelm the surveillance system.This work has numerous limitations. As in any active outbreak response, the data were collected by multiple teams under protocols that, by necessity, changed as the situation developed. Hence, there might be noise and inconsistency in definitions. Notably, the definition of a confirmed case changed to require symptoms near the end of our analysis period (Feb 7), but sensitivity analyses show that truncating the data at this point does not qualitatively influence results (appendix 2 pp 5\u20136). It is, likewise, impossible to identify every potential contact an individual has, so contact tracing focuses on those close contacts who are most likely to be infected; hence our R is assuredly lower than the true reproductive number in the population. Asymptomatic travellers will be missed by symptom-based surveillance and, even if they are tested, some asymptomatic contacts might be missed because of the imperfect sensitivity of the RT-PCR test.20\nRecovery time in Shenzhen is likely to be inflated because cases are required to be isolated for 2 weeks and release is conditional on a negative RT-PCR test. Although guidelines for contact tracing and case detection are supposed to be implemented across the country, whether the impact of contact tracing can be generalised to other parts of China depends on a range of factors, including local testing capacity and surveillance resources.As SARS-CoV-2 continues to spread, it is important that we continue to expand our knowledge about its transmission and natural history. Data from the early phase of local outbreaks, when detailed contact tracing is possible and sources of infection can still be reliably inferred, are particularly powerful for estimating critical values pertinent to describing transmission and the natural history of a disease. This is especially true when information about uninfected contacts and mode of detection is used, as we have done here. The resulting estimates provide important inputs for interpreting surveillance data, evaluating interventions, and setting public health policy.This online publication has been corrected.

In their study, Su and colleagues used modelling techniques from the Global Burden of Diseases study to generate comprehensive estimates of total tuberculosis spending from all sources across 135 low-income and middle-income countries between 2000 and 2017, allowing for comparisons across countries and over time. The authors estimate total spending for both notified and non-notified cases. These data can be helpful in understanding financial contributions from different sources including government, pre-paid private spending, out-of-pocket medical expenses, and development assistance for health funding, and in capturing the burden experienced by households and communities not typically captured by more traditional reports focused only on notified cases and government and donor spending. They also disaggregated spending estimates by function (eg, outpatient visits, pre-diagnosis visits, private drug spending).Su and colleagues found that total tuberculosis spending increased for 2000\u201317, driven primarily by government and national tuberculosis programme spending on notified cases, and that spending on non-notified cases also increased. Total out-of-pocket spending decreased over the same period; however, although the authors captured direct out-of-pocket spending on medical expenses, they did not include non-medical costs including loss of income, transport, and indirect economic costs due to tuberculosis (many of which are now being collected through WHO patient cost surveys) in their analysis. The authors' findings show that three countries with strong private sectors\u2014Democratic Republic of the Congo, Nigeria, and Pakistan\u2014have out-of-pocket medical expenses as the primary source of tuberculosis spending.Prepaid private and out-of-pocket spending contributions were found to be relatively small and that many governments in low-income and middle-income countries finance most national spending on tuberculosis. Several, but not all, high tuberculosis burden countries were middle-income countries and cost data is often skewed, driven by increased costs in these countries\u2014eg, average outpatient visits were estimated to cost US$35\u00b792 per visit, while the median cost was only $4\u00b724 per visit, meaning that in half of the countries the cost per visit was lower than $4\u00b724.Conversely many high tuberculosis burden low-income countries are still heavily reliant on development assistance for health spending. Notably, the authors present mean values weighted by population size or number of incident cases for the region, which is in line with the larger global burden of disease approach; however, such presentation requires careful interpretation. For instance, when looking at data for a specific country, the average total spend per incident case might be driven up by a few key countries in that region with large populations or numbers of incident cases, or both.Although the results might be an overestimation or underestimation of specific estimates, extensive sensitivity analyses done by the authors show that the qualitative results are robust. Therefore, trends over time and across countries can be used to monitor fluctuations in total tuberculosis spending and assess needs across regions. This work also raises many important questions around reasons for changes in tuberculosis spending trends. Future work in this area should investigate reasons why tuberculosis spending levels have changed over time, with a particular focus on understanding decreasing costs in specific countries.View Large Image\nCopyright \u00a9 2020 Flickr - CDC GlobaI declare no competing interests.", "S1473-30992030320-0": "Controversy exists regarding whether severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) can be transmitted in utero from an infected mother to her infant.1\nTo date, studies have mainly focused on women in late pregnancy.2\n,  3\n,  4\nWe report SARS-CoV-2 negativity in amniotic fluid from two pregnant women who were diagnosed with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in the early stage of pregnancy.

On Feb 12, she tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in a nasopharyngeal swab, and her chest CT scan showed typical signs of viral infection of both lungs on Feb 14. After isolating at home, the patient was admitted to hospital on Feb 18 due to persistent fever. On Feb 28, the patient was discharged from the hospital following two consecutive negative nucleic acid tests and observation that she was in the recovery phase on CT; she went into isolation at home.On March 23, the patients\u2014both of whom were in the second trimester of pregnancy\u2014tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 total antibodies in serum and were negative for SARS-CoV-2 RNA in throat swabs (appendix). On March 26, amniotic fluid samples were collected from the patients via percutaneous, ultrasound-monitored amniocentesis. The results of RT-PCR tests of the patients' amniotic fluid on March 26 were negative, and tests for SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG in amniotic fluid were also negative (normal IgM and IgG <10 AU/mL; figure; appendix). The patients' IgM and IgG concentrations in serum were also tested on March 26, with positive results for IgG in both cases; by contrast, only case 1 tested positive for IgM (appendix).Although SARS-CoV-2 was not detected in the amniotic fluid of these two patients, the possibility of vertical transmission in early and middle pregnancy could not be ruled out for several reasons. First, RNA is much less stable in amniotic fluid than is DNA.5\nSecond, the number of patients was insufficient to make a definite conclusion. Third, only transient positive results in amniocentesis have been reported for pregnant women infected with Zika virus, another RNA virus.5\nFinally, the virus might have been undetectable in amniotic fluid because of insufficient gestational age\u2014the best time for amniocentesis is after 18\u201321 weeks' gestation.6The study was limited by a small sample size and a lack of cord blood.

However, establishing the source of infection to ascertain the possible extent of spread can be difficult, because scant epidemiological data might be available. Even when possible nodes of transmission are retrospectively identified through epidemiological investigations, nucleic acid-based tests would not be diagnostically useful if these infected individuals have recovered and no longer shed the virus. Hence, serological tests are needed to identify convalescent cases and aid investigations and containment efforts.We present findings of investigations from Jan 29 to Feb 24, 2020, that linked two people with COVID-19 from Wuhan, China, to three clusters of COVID-19 cases in Singapore. Serological testing had a crucial role in establishing a link between clusters, showing its use in identifying convalescent COVID-19 cases and supporting epidemiological investigations.In Singapore, several surveillance methods are used to identify people with COVID-19. On Jan 2, 2020, a suspect case-definition of COVID-19 was circulated to all doctors in Singapore;4\n\ndoctors are legally required to notify the Ministry of Health of cases of COVID-19.5\n\nFrom Jan 31, 2020, Singapore began testing all patients with pneumonia in hospital for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2); this testing was later expanded to include people with pneumonia in primary care. The diagnosis of COVID-19 is confirmed either by a respiratory sample testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 using a laboratory-based RT-PCR6\nor by a serum sample testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 on serological analysis.7Research in context\nEvidence before this study\nWe searched PubMed on March 3, 2020, for reports on serological testing in individuals with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

Contact tracing before symptom onset was done to identify the source of exposure that led to the case being infected, allowing for further active case-finding around the source. Contact tracing after symptom onset until isolation was done to identify exposed individuals for quarantine to break the transmission chain. Both these approaches were part of the containment strategy. A close contact was defined as anyone who had prolonged contact within 2 m of the case. All close contacts with active or recent symptoms were tested, whereas those who were asymptomatic and exposed while the case was symptomatic were quarantined. Activity maps were reviewed and cross-checked to establish potential exposures and identify possible epidemiological links between cases and clusters.All epidemiological investigations and outbreak containment measures were implemented under the Infectious Diseases Act,5\n\nwhich allows use of data for analysis to control outbreaks.For laboratory confirmation of COVID-19, we did RT-PCR testing for SARS-CoV-2, using previously published methods.6\nTwo serological platforms were developed for confirmation of specific antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 in people with suspected infection or individuals with PCR-confirmed disease. A virus neutralisation test (VNT) was established at the Duke-National University of Singapore Medical School ABSL3 facility using a SARS-CoV-2 virus isolate (BetaCoV/Singapore/2/2020; GISAID accession number EPI_ISL_407987) cultured from a patient in Singapore; VNT was done using protocols previously published for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV).7\nFor ELISA assays, we used recombinant nucleocapsid protein from SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 expressed in mammalian cell culture using the pcDNA3.1 vector (ThermoFisher Scientific, Carlsbad, CA, USA), according to previously published methods,8\nand a recombinant receptor binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein custom-produced by a commercial provider (GenScript, Piscataway, NJ, USA). ELISA wells were coated with 100 ng of the respective protein per well and serum samples were used at dilutions from 1/50 to 1/400, followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-human IgG (Santa Cruz, Dallas, TX, USA) used at a dilution of 1/2000.The funders had no role in study design, data collection, data analysis, data interpretation, or writing of the report.

Three clusters were identified that involved two churches (Church A and Church B) and one family gathering. These clusters comprised 28 locally transmitted cases. The clusters were linked to two travellers (W1 and W2) from Wuhan, China, who attended a church service at Church A on Jan 19, 2020 (figure 1). The clusters at Church A and Church B were linked by one individual from Church A (A2), who probably transmitted the infection to the primary case of the Church B cluster (F1) at a family gathering on Jan 25, 2020. All cases were confirmed by RT-PCR testing, except for A2, who was diagnosed by serological testing.\nFigure 1Transmission map of COVID-19\nShow full caption\nView Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The clusters at Church A and Church B were detected in early February and mid-February, respectively. Although W1 and W2 were diagnosed with COVID-19 at the end of January, their possible link to Church A was only discovered after the Church A cluster was identified, through investigation and repeat interviews.5\n\nBy that time, A2 had recovered from COVID-19 and was not immediately linked to either cluster. Family members who had been infected at the family gathering on Jan 25, 2020, were first linked to F1 and were initially regarded as part of the cluster at Church B. However, subsequent investigations into case histories indicated that the family cluster was a distinct cluster and that A2 was most probably the missing link between the two church clusters; this idea was substantiated when A2's serological results were confirmed to be positive.Five locally transmitted cases of COVID-19 (A1\u2013A5) were linked to Church A. These people attended a church service on Jan 19, 2020, the same day W1 and W2 visited the church. Although all five people had developed symptoms by Feb 2, 2020 (figure 2), only A1, A4, and A5 were diagnosed (between Feb 6 and Feb 8, 2020), because they had been hospitalised for pneumonia and tested for SARS-CoV-2 as part of enhanced surveillance measures to test all patients admitted to hospital with pneumonia. A2 and A3 were not diagnosed when symptomatic in late January because their symptoms were mild and they did not meet the suspect case-definition at that time. A2 and A3 were tested only after mapping of activities and movements of other cases suggested that A2 could be the missing link between the clusters at Church A and Church B. An RT-PCR test of a nasopharyngeal specimen taken from A3 on Feb 18, 2020, was positive, although this individual had clinically recovered from the illness, which persisted from Jan 28 to Feb 10, 2020. Serological analysis of a serum sample obtained on the same day as the nasopharyngeal specimen was also positive. Although A2 had two negative RT-PCR tests, the serological result was positive, indicating past infection.\nFigure 2Incubation period, duration of symptoms, and length of admission, from Jan 14 to Feb 26, 2020\nShow full caption\nView Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)A2 and A3 attended a Chinese New Year family gathering on Jan 25, 2020, at the home of F1. Nine cases (A2, A3, and F1\u2013F7) were linked to this family gathering. A2, whose symptoms started on Jan 23, 2020, was unwell at this event and most probably was the primary source of transmission. A3 developed symptoms later, on Jan 28, 2020, and was, therefore, unlikely to be the source of infection at this gathering.17 locally transmitted cases were linked to Church B (B1\u2013B16 and F1). Thorough review of activity maps ascertained that F1, who had developed symptoms on Jan 29, 2020, and continued to work at Church B while ill, was the primary case of the Church B cluster.In mid-February, epidemiological and clinical evidence strongly suggested that A2 was the missing link between the clusters at Church A and Church B through attendance at the family gathering on Jan 25, 2020, while symptomatic. However, by the time this link was ascertained, more than 3 weeks had passed from symptom onset on Jan 23, 2020, and symptoms had resolved completely a week previously, on Feb 8\u201310, 2020. A2 had two negative RT-PCR test results from samples taken from the nasopharynx, with testing done 1 day apart on Feb 18 and Feb 19, 2020. The sample for serological testing was taken on Feb 18, 2020, and a positive result was confirmed on Feb 22, 2020.ELISA results for A2 and A3 on Feb 20, 2020 (figure 3A) showed a strong antibody response to the SARS-CoV-2 RBD protein, which was not seen in serum samples from SARS-CoV patients. The results were further confirmed by VNT on Feb 22, 2020 (figure 3B).\nFigure 3Serological testing of two patients\nShow full caption\nView Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)This investigation shows how SARS-CoV-2 serological analysis (ELISA detecting IgG and VNT detecting neutralising antibodies), in addition to use of traditional epidemiological methods, was important in establishing links among locally transmitted COVID-19 cases and tracing the transmission chain to an imported source. Detection of COVID-19 can be difficult because of the non-specific mild respiratory symptoms in many affected individuals and because some people might recover without being diagnosed.9\n\nAlthough PCR tests offer a rapid diagnostic solution, they can only detect SARS-CoV-2 during the period of viral shedding, which is the acute phase of infection. The duration of viral shedding for COVID-19 is not certain,10\nbut SARS-CoV data indicate that 21 days after symptom onset, 53% of cases achieved viral clearance in nasopharyngeal aspirate samples.11\nAs such, PCR testing alone is limited by its ability to detect convalescent cases.Serological testing can be especially useful in detecting a previous suspected infection in people who have recovered. For seroconversion kinetics, past coronavirus studies indicate that all patients with Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) seroconverted 3 weeks after symptoms started,12\nand 93% of patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) seroconverted at an average of 20 days from symptom onset.11\nThe first preliminary analysis of SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG indicated that the antibody response in COVID-19 patients is similar to, if not earlier than, these times.13\nCross-reactivity of immunoglobulins to closely related viruses such as SARS-CoV is a potential issue,14\nbut our RBD-based ELISA showed sufficient differentiation power, a finding further supported by VNT results.IgM serological testing might hold promise as a diagnostic method, although for SARS and MERS, limitations for its use have been noted.12\n,  13\nFor MERS, IgM was not detected earlier than IgG, and IgM against prevalent human coronaviruses showed cross-reactivity.12\nPreliminary data for SARS-CoV-2 IgM are promising,13\nbut more work is needed to assess the feasibility of IgM serological analysis as a rapid diagnostic method to enhance COVID-19 detection capabilities.For most people in the three clusters we report here, transmission of infection was accounted for by close contact with a symptomatic case. Our findings suggest that COVID-19 is largely transmitted by close contact, particularly when contact occurs over a prolonged period and in close congregation. Two churches were the setting for COVID-19 transmission in our report. A church cluster has also been reported in South Korea.15\n\nChurches host prolonged repeated activities, during which close contact occurs, thus providing the opportunity for disease spread through droplets or fomites. Singing (a common practice in churches) can generate droplets in a similar quantity to coughing.16\n,  17\nRepeated social interactions of church groups has also facilitated discovery of transmission, compared with other settings in which people might not know each other. The interactions are similar in nature to large family gatherings, which other cases in our report were linked to. Other similar settings include school and workplaces, in which respiratory disease transmission is not uncommon and should be the focus for preparedness, surveillance, and containment measures.Risk of transmission could be reduced if symptomatic people do not attend events in which prolonged social interactions take place (eg, at the family gathering when A2 was unwell, and F1 who continued to work at Church B while unwell). Other risk reduction measures could include having smaller group activities and prevention of interactions across these groups. Moreover, there may be common touchpoints within each setting that could result in contact transmission. To prevent transmission, people should practice increased personal hygiene and reduce physical contact to minimise indirect transmission risks.Linking disease transmission to an imported source and contact tracing for each identified case has facilitated a high capture of cases in Singapore. This successful linking of a large proportion of cases to imported sources provides encouraging evidence that the intense containment measures undertaken in Singapore have been effective. The three clusters we report here occurred relatively early in the emergence of COVID-19 in Singapore, within 4 weeks of the first imported case. As the epidemic continues, it might be progressively difficult to establish linkages by relying on traditional epidemiological methods alone. Challenges include difficulty in obtaining information from cases and contacts, which could be inaccurate because of recall and other biases. In our investigation, information for symptom onset of W1 and W2 was based on case history alone and could not be independently corroborated.5\n\nIn such instances, determining the transmission chain would have to account for possible inconsistencies in case history and rely on triangulation with other methods. The development and adoption of additional laboratory techniques, such as serological tests and phylogenetic analysis by whole-genome sequencing, could help identify possible links between cases.Serological testing is a key method in the response to the COVID-19 epidemic. As shown in our study, it enabled detection of a convalescent case, which could be key in initial containment efforts to discover transmission links to support containment efforts. Serological testing also detects people with mild or asymptomatic disease who have recovered, allowing for more accurate determination of the number of people probably infected in a cluster or the population. Identifying people who were probably infected in household or school clusters could help ascertain attack rates by age, particularly among children who mostly manifest less severe disease.18\nCalculating population-level attack rates is also important to estimate disease incidence and the case-fatality rate (CFR). Thus far, the CFR for COVID-19 has been based on PCR-diagnosed symptomatic cases. Serological surveys would be important to estimate CFR more accurately and would better inform calibrated responses to COVID-19. As the pandemic progresses, monitoring seroprevalence would enable countries to track transmission dynamics and population immunity levels and to inform disease control policies. Such monitoring would necessitate the development of ready serological testing solutions that are cost-effective and the establishment of population-level surveillance programmes to obtain blood samples.Development and application of serological assays has helped to unravel connections between three clusters of COVID-19 in Singapore, linking the disease to two travellers from China. Serological assays should be considered to identify mild or subclinical infections in the community.ContributorsVJML and YLT had the idea for the study and contributed to study design.

An urgent coordinated effort is now needed to align these populations with national and global COVID-19 responses.Migrants\u2014including the internally displaced, asylum seekers and refugees, undocumented migrants, and low-waged labour migrants\u2014can be neglected and marginalised, live in precarious conditions, and face barriers to accessing public health and social services in the countries in which they reside. These factors considerably complicate the control of the COVID-19 pandemic. This is exemplified by the situation facing low-waged labour migrants in the Middle East working in the construction sector, where living quarters are completely sealed off after cases of COVID-19 are detected. Movement in and out of compounds is being prohibited, with workers left living in suboptimal and overcrowded conditions with limited access to health care, and substantial knock-on effects from foregone salaries for both themselves and their families back home.2\nElsewhere, there have been reports of tens of thousands of labour migrants being expelled overnight back to their country of origin with no clear arrangements or provision of basic needs, such as food or shelter. In other countries, the mass movement of now unemployed labour migrants, who are evacuating cities to return home to rural communities, highlights that labour migrants\u2014the biggest global migrant group\u2014have not been well considered since public health measures have been introduced.3\nDespite a strong public health rationale to extend COVID-19 strategies to everyone to prevent ongoing transmission, governments might prioritise their own citizens, with migrants facing devastating consequences.\u2022 View related content for this articleIn an attempt to provide targeted advice to governments and agencies dealing with large populations of migrants, the Inter-Agency Standing Committee (IASC) has released interim technical guidance on strategies to support outbreak readiness and response among migrants in high-risk camp and slum settings.4\n\nLiving conditions in these contexts are highly conducive to outbreaks of communicable diseases. Migrants in these settings are susceptible to COVID-19 because of the health risks associated with overcrowding, poor sanitation, exposure to the elements due to substandard shelter, and prevailing malnutrition and ill health in some cases. The guidance calls on countries to ensure that migrants are not scapegoated, stigmatised, or otherwise targeted with specific or discriminatory measures. Additionally, the recommendations highlight key interventions that will have a positive effect, including maximising site planning for improved distancing among residents and crowd management, and practical interventions to promote infection prevention and control standards.An important component will be strong risk communication and community engagement, such as timely and accurate information in appropriate forms and accessible languages, and community involvement in the design of readiness and response plans. Lessons learned from past outbreaks in these contexts highlight that meaningful community engagement is a key element in ensuring that public health strategies are effective, including rapid uptake of vaccinations once available. Urgently strengthening surveillance systems to detect initial cases early can greatly reduce the propensity for COVID-19 to spread, and appropriate case management can reduce mortality among people infected with the virus. The declaration of temporary amnesties (eg, overturning restrictions on access to mainstream health systems) will also be crucial and is occurring in some countries. In Cox's Bazar, Bangladesh, which is home to 1 million Rohingya refugees, the Government of Bangladesh's national plan to respond to COVID-19 makes specific provision for Rohingya refugees,5\nwith preparedness efforts underway, including rapid production of cloth masks for frontline workers. Furthermore, food distribution agencies are implementing new ways of distributing food that minimise close person-to-person contact and volunteers are mobilising to spread hygiene and prevention messages.5\nIn Kenya, which hosts 500\u2008000 refugees from Somalia and South Sudan, the UN High Commissioner for Refugees is using text messaging to encourage migrants to report COVID-19 symptoms. Social distancing and other such measures are unlikely to be feasible in these settings. Instead of lockdowns and movement restrictions, emphasis should be placed on improving surveillance and testing; implementing feasible infection control measures, such as cohorting of cases; and ensuring prompt access to health care. These measures will be vitally important as the pandemic advances into these regions of the world because it seems probable that the virus' impact could well be severe on people living in low-income countries, specifically migrants and those affected by humanitarian crises.6\nIn these contexts there could be high transmissibility due to large household sizes, intense social mixing between older and younger age groups, and high infection-to-case ratios and progression to severe disease due to the virus' interaction with highly prevalent comorbidities (eg, non-communicable diseases, undernutrition, tuberculosis and HIV).6\nMaintaining the continuity of other important health programmes will also be crucial. Humanitarian stakeholders are rightly seizing opportunities now to maximise the simplification of care and treatment of diseases including tuberculosis and HIV, and delivery of vaccination programmes, to ensure that the global health gains made in recent years are not lost.The fragile health systems in many of these countries see major challenges in addressing the case load and it is conceivable that governments hosting many refugees and migrants could face difficult decisions around the allocation of scarce resources, how to deal with migrants within their borders, and the strategies and approaches needed to incorporate them effectively into their COVID-19 response. Therefore, action is now required to advocate for migrants globally and to guarantee their protection. 40 years of responding to the HIV epidemic has clearly taught us the benefits of a rights-based approach to ensuring an effective and proportionate response to outbreaks.7\n\nAdvocating for equal prevention and treatment opportunities should be highlighted as a central pillar in reducing global transmission of COVID-19.8\nThese migrant populations need support now, alongside early access to tests, drugs, and vaccines once available.We declare no competing interests.SH is funded by the National Institute for Health Research ( Advanced Fellowship NIHR300072 ).", "S1473-30992030310-8": "CT has a leading place in the management of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Mediastinal lymph node enlargement is not considered a typical CT feature of COVID-19, and only 6% of patients admitted to hospital for COVID-19 had lymphadenopathy.1\nThis observation is concordant with previous studies in Chinese populations.2\n,  3\nHowever, our experience in critically ill patients with COVID-19 in France seems to be different.15 patients with positive RT-PCR for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) were admitted to our intensive care unit (ICU) for acute respiratory failure on March 27, 2020. Among them, nine patients were under invasive mechanical ventilation and one patient was also under extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, whereas two patients were under high-flow nasal canula oxygenation. CT examination was performed in nine patients, with typical ground-glass opacities, reticulation, or consolidation features observed in all patients, as described in a recent expert consensus statement on chest CT findings related to COVID-19.4\nThe median number of days between onset of symptoms and CT scans was 7 days (IQR 6\u20138). Lymphadenopathies greater than 10 mm in the short axis were observed in six (66%) of the nine patients. Notably, several patients had voluminous lymphadenopathies, particularly in the subcarinal location, measuring up to 30 mm in the short axis (appendix). Invasive microbiological samples were assessed to rule out bacterial or fungal coinfection in all patients. Similarly, no patient had any haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, neoplasia, or systemic disease.\u2022 View related content for this articleThus, lymphadenopathy was more common in our French cohort of ICU patients than previously reported. To our knowledge, highly enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes have not been described in patients with COVID-19. Most reports were not specifically concerning critically ill patients, so disease severity could probably explain this discrepancy, as suggested by Li and colleagues.5\nFurther studies are needed to better characterise the CT features of patients with COVID-19, in order to establish a possible link between the presence of specific radiological signs and the severity of the disease. Pending such studies, lymphadenopathy should not be considered an atypical feature of COVID-19, especially when we have seen that mediastinal lymph nodes are very large in our critically ill patients.We declare no competing interests.", "S1473-30992030322-4": "As of April 14, 2020, just under 2 million cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have been reported worldwide.1\nWith the pandemic growing at an alarming rate and national governments struggling to control local epidemics because of scant diagnostics and impermanent non-pharmaceutical interventions, we should look to additional epidemiological solutions. Locations such as Singapore and Taiwan have been successful in slowing epidemic growth by using intensive surveillance with broader testing strategies to identify and contain cases.2\n,  3In The Lancet Infectious Diseases, Sarah Ee Fang Yong and colleagues4\nreport three clusters of COVID-19 cases identified in Singapore in early 2020 by active case-finding and contact tracing and confirmed with RT-PCR. One cluster from a church (Church A) was previously identified5\nand linked to two imported cases from Wuhan, China. The two additional clusters (Church B and a family gathering) were attributable to community transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) by one individual interacting with both clusters. Serological platforms were developed and assessed for confirmation of SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody responses to capture past infections. By serological analysis, Yong and colleagues identified the missing link between the Church A cluster and the other two clusters\u2014an individual who had twice tested negative by RT-PCR. By linking all three clusters, Yong and colleagues highlight the success of such surveillance measures to capture many cases and effectively slow the spread of COVID-19 in Singapore.\u2022 View related content for this articleThis investigation exemplifies the failings of RT-PCR as a sole diagnostic method in surveillance, because of its inability to detect past infection, and the added value of serological testing, which if captured within the correct timeframe after disease onset can detect both active and past infections.6\n,  7\nIn public health practice, serological analysis can be useful for rapid case-identification and the subsequent chain of events to actively identify close contacts, recommend quarantine, and define clusters of cases. Contact tracing, which is a necessary but insufficient means of disease control, needs careful effort and is sensitive to timing to be effective, particularly in highly dense populations. As shown in Singapore, serological analysis can be useful for contact tracing in urban environments and linking clusters of cases retrospectively to delineate transmission chains and ascertain how long transmission has been ongoing or to estimate the proportion of asymptomatic individuals in the population.Beyond the immediate use of serological data to identify and contain cases, these data can also be used to set control policies. Population serological testing (specifically measuring SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG antibody titres) can estimate the total number of infections by assessing the number of individuals who have mounted an immune response, regardless of whether an infection was subclinical or happened in the recent past (current data suggest antibodies persist for at least 4 weeks).8\nBy providing estimates of who is and is not immune to SARS-CoV-2, serological data can be used in at least four ways. First, to estimate epidemiological variables, such as the attack rate or case-fatality rate, which are necessary to assess how much community transmission has occurred and its burden. Second, to strategically deploy immune health-care workers to reduce exposure of the virus to susceptible individuals. Third, to assess the effect of non-pharmaceutical interventions at the population-level and inform policy changes to release such measures, Fourth, to identify individuals who mounted a strong immunological response to the virus and whose antibody isolates can be used to treat patients via plasma therapy.9Although the potential for serological assays to help control the COVID-19 pandemic is substantial, the complexity of developing and validating a diagnostic test is not fully elucidated by Yong and colleagues.4\nSerological assays are currently being developed for widespread use.10\nYet, several challenges remain: first, assessing the sensitivity and specificity of tests, particularly for determining disease during the acute phase of infection; second, verifying the test is not detecting cross-reactivity with other viral pathogens that result in false-positive results; third, understanding antibody kinetics over time to distinguish thresholds of immunity, because we do not know how long immunity to this novel coronavirus might last; and finally, ensuring the test is reliable for distribution and is cost-efficient. Although RT-PCR diagnostics will still be vital for identifying acute infection, as the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic continues to spread and cases accumulate, serological testing and data will prove increasingly important to understand the pandemics' past and predict its future.View Large Image\nCopyright \u00a9 2020 Flickr - Roberto HerdiyantoWe declare no competing interests.", "S1473-30992030312-1": "Severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is not just a serious respiratory viral disease, as influenza is, but rather a systemic multiorgan viral invasion. It is frequently complicated by overwhelming immunological reactions, with overactivation of T cells, leading to acute respiratory distress syndrome and multiorgan failure, secondary to immunopathological processes. The viral load of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 is not correlated with worsening symptoms, but it is the host inflammatory response that is a major cause of lung damage and subsequent mortality.1\n,  2\nHyper-inflammatory responses in patients with COVID-19 are associated with a cytokine storm that is characterised by an increase in proinflammatory cytokines, including tumour necrosis factor, interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2, IL-6, and other chemokines in serum.3\n,  4\nOverwhelming secretion of cytokines causes severe lung damage, which manifests as extensive damage to pulmonary vascular endothelial cells and alveolar epithelial cells, as well as increased pulmonary vascular permeability, leading to pulmonary oedema and hyaline membrane formation.2\n,  3\n,  4Most clinical trials to date have evaluated various strategies of antivirals, immunomodulators, host-targeted drugs, immune-based therapies, or immunosuppressive drugs, including steroids, IL-6 or IL-1 antagonists, and selinexor; all have assessed single drugs with a clinical endpoint using the WHO seven-point ordinal scale.5\n\nAlthough some of these drugs might have clinically meaningful effects on viral burden or some of the immune-related signs, it is highly improbable that a single drug will be enough to control and improve the most severe forms of COVID-19. It is likely that both antivirals and blockage of inflammatory pathways are needed to optimise responses. For example, it would be relevant to understand the role of steroids in combination with or sequential to antiviral treatments. Without studying combinations, and their potential synergies or additive effects, potentially useful agents could be disregarded. Furthermore, in the absence of synergistic combinations, single drugs might cause more harm\u2014for example, mass killing of the virus might enhance inflammatory responses. Because of the urgency of the current situation and, so far, an absence of clear evidence of a clinically meaningful effect of any monotherapy strategy, investigators should join their efforts in proposing, rather than adaptive or sequential studies of a single strategy, combined approaches through multifactorial designs. This approach will enable determination of the risks and benefits of combinations versus monotherapies. Such trials with multifactorial designs (eg, with randomisation first to antivirals and then to adjunctive immune-based therapy) are urgently needed and could provide more rapidly clinically meaningful results.\u2022 View related content for this articleFurthermore, with improving knowledge of the various clinical presentations of COVID-19, better definitions of patient populations at highest risk of poor outcomes, based not only on clinical status but also on biomarkers (eg, C-reactive protein, D-dimer, ferritin, and IL-6), should be incorporated into inclusion criteria and stratifications.6\nFinally, the optimal timing or sequence of administration of the components of therapy during a worsening COVID-19 disease course need to be explored.

For countries still in the early phase of an outbreak, there is concern regarding insufficient supply of intensive care unit (ICU) beds and ventilators to handle the impending surge in critically ill patients. To inform pandemic preparations, we projected the number of ventilators that will be required in the USA at the peak of the COVID-19 outbreak.Our estimates combine recent evaluations of COVID-19 hospitalisations1\nand data on the proportion of patients with COVID-19 in the ICU requiring ventilation (appendix p 2). At a basic reproduction number of 2\u00b75,1\n115\u2008001 (IQR 101\u2008006\u2013131\u2008770) invasive ventilators and 89\u2008788 (78\u2008861\u2013102\u2008880) non-invasive ventilators would be needed, on average, at outbreak peak (figure).\nFigureProjected number of ICU patients requiring ventilators in the absence of any community interventions with R0=2\u00b75\nShow full caption\nView Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Considering that 29\u00b70% of the existing 97\u2008776 ICU beds in the USA are routinely occupied by patients without COVID-19 requiring invasive mechanical ventilation,2\n,  3\n\nwe calculated that 69\u2008660 of the 98\u2008015 invasive ventilators in the USA before outbreak start would be available for the COVID-19 response.4\n\n,  5\nThese available ventilators include additional units in stockpile or storage. Consequently, at least 45\u2008341 (IQR 31\u2008346\u201362\u2008110) additional units would be needed for the surge at the peak. Of the 22\u2008976 non-invasive ventilators,5\nwe estimated that 12\u2008499 units would be available, assuming 54\u00b74% availability as estimated for routinely used invasive ventilators (appendix p 1). For these non-invasive devices, a minimum of 77\u2008289 (66\u2008362\u201390\u2008381) additional units would be needed at the peak. As a step towards filling this gap, 52\u2008635 limited-featured devices exist.5\nAlthough these could be deployed for treatment of moderate cases, they might not be an appropriate substitute for ventilators in the care of severely ill patients.5These estimates should represent a lower bound for additional ventilator requirements. To avoid triage for use of ventilators,6\nunits would have to be perfectly distributed both geographically and temporally, which in turn relies on centralised coordination among states and more precise forecasting than is currently possible given the constraints on testing for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. Worryingly, areas such as New York city are experiencing the first surge of cases in the absence of national coordination, while facing competition with other regions simultaneously trying to secure these critically important resources.7\nAlso concerning is that the USA is already several weeks into its epidemic. With invasive ventilator needs exceeding availability at week 14 of our simulations, there are substantially fewer weeks to procure the requisite supply.We urge three complementary avenues of action to reduce the imbalance between supply and demand for ventilators. First, vigilant social distancing has potential to flatten the curve,1\nwhich will both delay and suppress the outbreak peak. In addition to reducing the peak demand for ventilators, the delay would provide a window of opportunity to ramp up ventilator production. Second, it is plausible that the USA will experience several asynchronous local peaks rather than one apex. A nationalised allocation system that transfers ventilators based on state-level epidemiological projections would most efficiently capitalise on existing units. Third, the USA simply needs more ventilators. In that respect, the Defense Production Act has been invoked, compelling some automobile manufacturers to shift production to ventilators.8\nThis Act also permits the Administration to coordinate distribution among states, thereby addressing our second recommendation. The Administration has refused to engage in coordination, suggesting that it is not yet needed. However, given the time required to refit manufacturers and begin producing ventilators, waiting until the national shortage is upon us would be disastrous. By contrast, these three steps will save lives and avoid the devastating rationing that would unfold in the absence of action.APG acknowledges funding from the National Institutes of Health (NIH; grants UO1-GM087719 and 1R01AI151176-01 ), the Burnett and Stender families' endowment, the Notsew Orm Sands Foundation, and a National Science Foundation grant for rapid response research ( grant 2027755 ).

In the past two decades alone, five new human coronaviruses have been discovered, three of which are highly pathogenic.1\n,  2\nThe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is just the latest example of the danger posed by zoonotic diseases, foreshadowed by the regional, but unabated, emergence of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV).3\nIn recognition of its intrinsic threat to public health and as a prototypical member of the family Coronaviridae, WHO, in 2015, prioritised MERS-CoV as a pathogen to which increased resources should be dedicated for countermeasure research and development. The newly established Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations followed suit with investments in the development of candidate MERS-CoV vaccines.4\nIn subsequent years, three vaccine candidates have completed initial clinical evaluation and are now ready for advanced testing.5\n,  6\n,  7\n,  8\n,  9In The Lancet Infectious Diseases, two groups8\n,  9\nreport results from phase 1 clinical trials of non-replicating viral vector MERS-CoV vaccines.

The two vaccines demonstrated tolerable safety profiles (no vaccine-related serious adverse events were reported for either vaccine) and induced humoral and cellular immune responses at peak, post-vaccination timepoints. ChAdOx1 MERS was administered as a single injection, whereas MVA-MERS-S was given as a two-dose regimen, with a 28-day interval between doses. Both products were tested in a dose-escalating design. Although the frequency and severity of adverse events were proportional to vaccine dose in both studies, only higher doses of ChAdOx1 MERS improved immunogenicity. A single dose of ChAdOx1 MERS also showed an earlier ascent and slower decay of antibody-mediated and cell-mediated immunity than two doses of MVA-MERS-S. While noting that binding antibody levels are reported differently between these studies, a single dose of ChAdOx1 MERS vaccine induced detectable antibody titres at day 180 (in 18 [75%] of 24 participants) and day 364 (13 [68%] of 19 participants) after vaccination, whereas with MVA-MERS-S only three (14%) of 22 vaccine recipients had detectable antibody titres at day 180.\u2022 View related content for this articleDifferences in the magnitude, kinetics, and character of the elicited immune responses raise common concerns for the development pathway of outbreak vaccines against MERS-CoV and, more acutely, SARS coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Interrogation of the humoral and cellular immune profiles of the vaccine candidates highlights the first point: what immune responses do coronavirus vaccines need to elicit to confer protection against infection or severe disease? Although the question is applicable to many viruses, the answer to this question has been elusive among coronaviruses.10\n,  11\nWithout previous identification of a potential correlate of protection, it becomes difficult to ascertain the relevance of immunogenicity outputs. Second, there remains a lack of consensus on the methodology by which immunogenicity outputs are measured.12\nAlthough the two trials report similar assessments of humoral responses\u2014binding antibody, wild-type MERS virus, and pseudovirus neutralisation assays\u2014it is difficult to know how these individual results compare between studies. Koch and colleagues9\nfound a strong correlation between binding and neutralising antibody titres (Spearman's correlation r=0\u00b786 [95% CI 0\u00b76960\u20130\u00b79427], p=0\u00b70001), whereas Folegatti and colleagues8\ndid not (Spearman's r=0\u00b728, p=0\u00b7175). Does this represent an immunologically relevant difference between vaccine-induced responses or a methodological difference between laboratories? Finally, some animal studies suggest that certain SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV vaccines might, upon viral challenge, be associated with eosinophilic pulmonary infiltrates. This finding underscores the importance of factoring safety into the design, monitoring, and long-term follow-up of coronavirus vaccine trials\u2014something that cannot be fully addressed in the two early-stage MERS vaccine trials herein, but which will undoubtedly be considered in future efficacy trials.The experience with SARS and the emergence of MERS, particularly during the outbreaks of 2014\u201315 in the Arabian and Korean peninsulas, were harbingers of the consequences of COVID-19, and similar pathogens, on all sectors of society\u2014not only in overall morbidity and mortality, but also in the capacity to level economies and disrupt social order.13\nIf MERS has been eclipsed by its pandemic cousin, then the lessons learned have prepared the global vaccine research and development community for moving coronavirus vaccines forward at an accelerated pace, such that first-in-human COVID-19 vaccine trials are moving on unprecedented, shortened timelines. To stay ahead of these increasingly frequent outbreaks, the field must maintain momentum in advancing rapid, scalable, and translatable vaccine strategies, not only for MERS-CoV, but even more urgently for SARS-CoV-2 and, ultimately, the next novel coronavirus that leaps from its animal host to humans.View Large Image\nCopyright \u00a9 2020 Flickr - NIAIDWe declare no competing interests.

India had shown a staggered course of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) transmission, with 1397 cases diagnosed between Jan 31, and April 1, 2020. However, there has been a recent surge in cases, with numbers rising to 5194 as of April 8.1The Indian Council of Medical Research, under the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, has recommended chemoprophylaxis with hydroxychloroquine (400 mg twice on day 1, then 400 mg once a week thereafter) for asymptomatic health-care workers treating patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19, and for asymptomatic household contacts of confirmed cases.2\n\nThe document states \u201cits use in prophylaxis is derived from available evidence of benefit as treatment and supported by preclinical data\u201d. Although some in-vitro evidence supports the antiviral activity of hydroxychloroquine and its precursor chloroquine, there is no peer-reviewed publication that evaluates either drug for exposure prophylaxis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Even for treatment of diagnosed cases, only one small study reported faster nasopharyngeal viral clearance, with no data for clinical improvement.3\nThis evidence, or the lack thereof, hardly justifies state-endorsed, widespread use of hydroxychloroquine for prophylaxis.\u2022 View related content for this articleWe are deeply concerned that in this environment of global panic, an endorsement by the highest scientific body of India (and also by the President of the USA)4\nwill create an overly optimistic perception of the effectiveness of hydroxychloroquine among the public. Markets in the USA are already reporting a short supply of both hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine.4\nThe situation in India is no different, probably indicating widespread self-medication.The shortage of chloroquine, an inexpensive antimalarial in low-income malaria-endemic countries like India, could lead to preventable morbidity and mortality. Moreover, mathematical models estimate a worst-case scenario of 10 million cases of COVID-19 in New Delhi, India, alone in the coming weeks.5\nIn these chaotic times, no health-care system can screen such a large number of healthy contacts for concomitant QTc prolonging medicines, long QT syndromes, or glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency. Even a 0\u00b71% proportion of serious complications would amount to more than 10\u2008000 severe adverse events in New Delhi alone, a number an already overwhelmed health-care system would not be able to cope with. The drug is untested, the benefits unknown, and the risks not negligible, especially at this scale of use. Moreover, the safety of these immunomodulators in people at risk of a severe viral illness has never been evaluated.An ongoing pandemic justifies leeway in generation and interpretation of evidence in the interest of public health. However, all scientific reasoning cannot be abandoned citing desperate times. A blanket recommendation for chemoprophylaxis in the absence of credible evidence might be contentious to say the least. If hydroxychloroquine is to be used, a clear informed choice needs to be offered to every contact, explaining the scarcity of evidence for its efficacy and its potential risks. Additionally, all outcome events should be recorded.

Moreover, chloroquine affects immune system activity by mediating an anti-inflammatory response, which might reduce damage due to the exaggerated inflammatory response.1\nAt the time of the SARS epidemic, chloroquine was suggested as a drug that could be used to treat this infection.2\nHowever, randomised, double-blind, controlled studies in humans to evaluate its efficacy for this use were not done, and the true clinical efficacy of chloroquine in treating coronavirus infections was not established.Because coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is associated with substantial morbidity and mortality,3\nand no specific pharmacological treatment that is effective against it is available, chloroquine and chloroquine-related formulations have been tentatively included among drugs for use in limiting the total burden of COVID-19.4\n,  5\nHowever, no studies have evaluated the use of chloroquine for prophylaxis.\u2022 View related content for this articleChloroquine is a cheap drug that has been used for decades\u2014predominantly for malaria prophylaxis, for which it had excellent results and good safety and tolerability.1\nSevere adverse events, which mainly involve retinal and psychiatric symptoms, occur only when doses prescribed for malaria are substantially higher than required.1\nInhibition of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) replication seems essential to reduce the risk of spread and development of COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 is highly contagious.5\nMost people who live in areas with a high incidence of COVID-19 are apparently healthy, but they can be SARS-CoV-2 negative and healthy or healthy but with asymptomatic infection. In both cases, effective drugs such as chloroquine and its related formulations might prevent infection (ie, in those who are SARS-CoV-2 negative) or the development of severe symptomatic disease (ie, in those who are SARS-CoV-2 positive and asymptomatic or with minor symptoms), substantially reducing morbidity and mortality due to COVID-19. The dose used might be the same as that usually administered for malaria treatment given chloroquine inhibited SARS-CoV replication at a 50% effective concentration of 8\u00b78 \u03bcmol/L. The half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of chloroquine inhibition of SARS-CoV replication in Vero E6 cells, 8\u00b78 \u03bcmol/L, is substantially lower than the plasma concentrations that are reached in humans when the drug is prescribed to treat malaria at a dose of 25 mg/kg over 3 days.1\nFor long-term prophylaxis, even lower doses could be used. Doses of 3\u00b76 mg/kg, similar to those generally prescribed to treat rheumatoid arthritis, lead to plasma concentrations of 1\u20133 \u03bcmol/L\u2014ie, the same concentration range as the IC50 for SARS-CoV inhibition.1\nAlternatively, hydroxychloroquine could be used, for which even greater efficacy has been reported in in-vitro studies.5\nProphylaxis could last for the whole duration of an outbreak, and in countries in which malaria is not endemic, there is no risk of negative events associated with the development of resistance to this drug. In countries where malaria is endemic, appropriate monitoring of resistance among Plasmodium spp is needed.Future studies might better elucidate the most effective schedule of administration and potential adverse events.

At least a third of the global population is in some form of lockdown, treading the fine line between health services overwhelmed with rapidly rising infections and an economic recession with its own detrimental health consequences. Although this surreal situation might seem like a plot from the Avengers franchise, the hard reality is that the selfless actions of health-care workers will not alone restore the world to normality. Ending the COVID-19 pandemic will take many more months, if not years, so it is time to revisit what we know and make some difficult choices about mitigating subsequent infection waves.COVID-19 is here to stay, at least until safe and efficacious vaccines become available. Immunisation must be rolled out across the globe to limit the extent of resurgences of infection and to allow us to even entertain the idea of eradication. Presently, one vaccine candidate is in a phase 2 trial, four in phase 1 trials, and 56 in preclinical studies, but the earliest any might be available is September. The key reason for the lockdowns is to allow health-care systems to cope with a spike of severe cases. However, many systems in high-income countries are still under-resourced. For example, only on April 10 did the UK Government publish a plan on managing personal protective equipment (PPE). The first short-term management measure should be to massively increase production and supply of essentials such as appropriate, WHO-approved PPE and dwindling intensive-care drugs. The longer we delay supply, the longer intensive-care units will remain overwhelmed, patients with life-threatening, non-COVID-19 conditions without adequate treatment, and people sliding into poverty because of the economic impact of stringent lockdowns. While these shortages are addressed, emergency measures such as sterilising single-use respirator masks with H2O2 could be considered. Additionally, some health-care settings are scaling up their use of telemedicine to minimise non-essential physician-to-patient contact. Such measures need to be expediated while permanent increases in health-care capacities are developed.The second urgent measure is widespread testing in all affected countries, first through antigen and RT-PCR tests for active or convalescing infections and then through IgG and IgM testing for an improved picture of the actual number of past infections. This knowledge will be crucial to inform a more accurate global infection-fatality rate that will then guide governmental decisions on the features, scale, and duration of lockdowns.Two important questions, besides which tests are the most reliable, are who should be tested and who should be financially responsible for implementing testing. Considering the confusion about the true scale of asymptomatic infections and the advanced stage of the first wave, testing based on contact-tracing is no longer feasible as a standalone approach. A complementary random, cross-sectional testing scenario where one in three to four people get tested every 14 days for both active infection and antibodies could be considered. This approach would fill gaps in contact-tracing and would allow people with confirmed immunity to return to work, easing pressures on government welfare schemes. Also to this end, the responsibility for testing could be shared between governments and private companies that have not been affected by compulsory shut-downs.Finally, although a triage of key versus non-key workers for movement during lockdowns already exists, it could be extended to include low-risk age groups living in low-risk households. Those people could be allowed to return to the economy while maintaining a degree of social distancing to protect those most vulnerable to severe disease and key workers (who might be at comparatively higher risk but have been required to continue working). Thus, herd immunity through naturally acquired infection might increase until vaccination programmes can start.Of course, there is no one-size-fits-all strategy. In low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs) with weak health-care systems, dense populations, and poor compliance with hygiene practices, vaccination should be prioritised as soon as it becomes available. Extremely rapid, sample-in-answer-out tests would be paramount as lockdowns in such settings are not feasible because most people rely on daily earnings. The COVID-19 situation in LMICs is discussed in The Lancet Global Health May 2020 Editorial. To longitudinally manage this pandemic, we must share lessons from diverse experiences and creatively apply them to our home settings, while strengthening international collaboration.View Large Image\nCopyright \u00a9 2020 Flickr/Gavriil Papadiotis", "S1473-30992030303-0": "Several problems undermine the preparedness of countries in Latin America to face the spread of COVID-19. Talha Burki reports.Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has arrived late in South America. On February 25, 2020, Brazil was the first nation in the region to report the disease. Within weeks, countries across the continent had closed their borders and enforced lockdowns. As of April 14, Latin America has registered more than 65\u2008000 cases of COVID-19. Ecuador, in particular, has been badly affected, with reports of corpses left abandoned on the streets. Pandemic preparedness varies across the region and several countries are particularly vulnerable to a destructive outbreak. For example, Guatemala and Haiti have little more than 100 ventilators between them. Mexico has high rates of hypertension, obesity, and diabetes, all of which are risk factors for severe disease after infection with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).\u2022 View related content for this article\u201cIt is a very difficult situation\u201d, explains Alfonso Rodr\u00edguez-Morales, Colombian Association of Infectious Diseases, Colombia. \u201cObviously the healthcare systems are not trained for coronavirus; we had a little extra time to get ready for the arrival of the disease but some places are really going to struggle.\u201d Thus far, Brazil has recorded the largest number of cases\u2014more than 23\u2008000, as of April 13. The country has a good public healthcare system, and it is experienced in dealing with epidemics. The past few years have seen serious outbreaks of chikungunya, dengue, yellow fever, and Zika.There is also the issue of the favelas, home to around 13 million Brazilians. In the favelas, conditions are crowded and access to clean water is limited. In such circumstances, social distancing and hand-washing are virtually impossible. \u201cThe recommendations for preventing infection are based on assumptions that do not apply in the favelas\u201d, said Clare Wenham, Assistant Professor of Global Health Policy, London School of Economics and Political Science, UK. \u201cIt is hard to see how they will be able to prevent infection or control the virus once it has been let loose.\u201d The outlook is similar for slums elsewhere on the continent.Healthcare in Brazil is the responsibility of the municipalities. This includes pandemic preparedness. It means that matters such as the provision of personal protective equipment, rules on social distancing, and testing arrangements vary. But it also limits the influence of President Jair Bolsonaro, which could work in the country's favour. Bolsonaro has repeatedly minimised the threat of COVID-19 and undermined efforts to enforce social distancing.After Bolsonaro returned from an official trip to the USA in early March, 24 members of his delegation tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Instead of going into quarantine, the president attended a public rally. In late March, he issued orders preventing the states from restricting people's movements and removing the requirement for churches to comply with health regulations. Both moves were quickly overturned by the courts. \u201cYou have mixed messages in Brazil\u201d, said Wenham. \u201cThe president is encouraging people to go out and resume their normal lives, while the mayors and governors are stressing the importance of maintaining quarantine\u201d.Bolsonaro is not the only leader whose behaviour has caused concern. In February 2020, Mexico's president Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrado described COVID-19 as \u201cnot even as bad as the flu\u201d. He subsequently urged Mexicans to visit restaurants and diners. Daniel Ortega, president of Nicaragua since 2007, has not been seen in public since March 12. In his absence, his wife and vice-president Rosario Murillo has co-ordinated the response to the pandemic. She has declined to close schools and shops. Nicaragua is the only nation in Central America to have kept its borders open. Even the local football league has not been suspended. Nicaragua has only registered nine cases of COVID-19, a number experts find implausible and might reflect lack of testing. \u201cWe have concerns for the lack of social distancing, the convening of mass gatherings. We have concerns about the testing, contact tracing, the reporting of cases. We also have concerns about what we see as inadequate infection prevention and control\u201d, commented Carissa Etienne, director of PAHO, in a virtual press conference.Experts are more optimistic about Cuba. \u201cCuba is one of the best prepared locations anywhere in the world to deal with an outbreak\u201d, said Wenham. \u201cThey have a very strong, integrated healthcare system which can respond the moment an infectious disease is detected.\u201d The contrast with Venezuela is stark. \u201cThe situation in Venezuela is critical; when coronavirus hits, it is going to be impossible to contain\u201d, said Tamara Taraciuk Broner, Human Rights Watch, Buenos Aires, Argentina. \u201cEven in hospitals, there are not the facilities for hand-washing with soap.\u201dAside from a brief interruption in 2016, the Venezuelan government has not published epidemiological data for several years. The healthcare system has all but collapsed. The once-impressive laboratory system has been looted. Some 5 million Venezuelans have fled. \u201cThere is an ongoing humanitarian crisis, an access to food crisis, the surveillance system is not running properly, there is very limited diagnostic capacity and very limited access to healthcare\u201d, said Rodr\u00edguez-Morales. \u201cNow things are going to become even more complicated for Venezuela with COVID-19.\u201d It is impossible to know how many cases the country has already seen, though the official tally is 171.Rodr\u00edguez-Morales worries about testing capacity across the region. \u201cIn a country like Colombia, we will need to run 500 tests per day\u201d, he told The Lancet Infectious Diseases. Brazil has the advantage of a sizeable biotech industry. But it is not clear whether this will be enough to meet the expected demand. The health ministry predicts that by the peak of epidemic, Brazil will have to process 30\u2008000\u201350\u2008000 tests per day. Its current capacity is 6700 tests per day. Diagnostics are mostly centralised in Latin America. \u201cTests are run by the national institutes of health; very few countries run regional, local, or university laboratories\u201d, explains Rodr\u00edguez-Morales. \u201cBut they are going to have to find ways to increase capacity, and in some places that will be a difficult and complicated task\u201d.An ongoing dengue outbreak, which infected more than 3 million people in the Americas last year, further complicates matters. It is too early to tell how SARS-CoV-2 and dengue virus infection will interact with one another. In any case, addressing two epidemics is a major task. \u201cBrazil has an excellent public health system, but it cannot cope with competing crises\u201d, said Wenham. Cases of COVID-19 and dengue are likely to peak at the same time. There are also questions over how vector control can be effectively managed during a lockdown. \u201cWe could easily end up in a situation where there is a surge of all vector-borne diseases\u201d, said Wenham.In addition to these problems, Latin America has some of the most overcrowded prisons in the world. Thousands of prisoners have yet to face trial. Brazil alone has incarcerated 773\u2008000 people, one-third of whom are in a pretrial detention. Rates of tuberculosis among prisoners in the country are 35 times higher than in the general population. Haiti's detention facilities have an occupancy rate of 450%. Countries such as Argentina, Brazil, and Chile are taking steps to reduce their prison populations in light of the pending epidemic. Nonetheless, the prospects for South America's prisoners are bleak.The coming weeks will show if Latin America can cope with the increase in cases of COVID-19, but it is expected that the death toll will be high.View Large Image\nCopyright \u00a9 2020 Flickr \u2013 Agencia Brasilia", "S1473-30992030301-7": "An expert in rural health advises governments to take a systematic approach to tackling the coronavirus crisis rather than focusing solely on urban areas. Peter Ranscombe reports.One of the most striking images of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic came after India's government initiated a 3-week lockdown on March 24, 2020, forcing millions of migrant workers to flood out of its cities on foot and return to their homes in the countryside, amid promises of financial help for casual labourers. Days later, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi used his weekly radio address to beg for forgiveness from the poorest members of society, who were being left without jobs and food due to the shutdown.\u2022 View related content for this articleThat movement of people is being repeated throughout the world and is a concern for Peter Williams, President of the International Institute of Rural Reconstruction (IIRR), New York, USA. \u201cInfectious diseases spread along transportation routes\u201d, he explaines. \u201cPeople are moving from major places of concentration, like cities, into less densely populated communities.\u201d While cities may be the economic centres that drive national economies, Williams calls on governments not to overlook the plight of rural areas and peri-urban areas\u2014those that sit on the fringes of cities, in places such as Bangladesh and many parts of Africa\u2014during the pandemic. \u201cIt would be quite a short-sighted measure for governments to focus their attention on cities,\u201d he said. \u201cThe IIRR doesn't believe in the either/or dichotomy. We always believe in taking a systemic approach to challenges. Urban environments such as cities and towns do require a particular approach but\u2014at the same time and not afterwards\u2014you need to be putting in approaches that are specific and nuanced to a peri-urban environment as well as a rural environment. That means contact tracing\u2014tracking how people are moving, where they're going to\u2014and understanding how these rural and peri-urban communities are then affected by the movement of people that were once in cities and have now returned to the countryside.\u201dWilliams believes that adopting a systematic approach should include examining the socio-medical, socio-economic, and socio-political implications of tackling the pandemic. He thinks that education is key to make sure that communities understand how the disease spreads, but without using complex technical language. \u201cIt took some time, but we eventually saw examples of the importance of education during the Ebola crisis, when it wasn't until Liberians in particular began to understand the extent to which this epidemic was something that would affect their lives and their families and their children\u201d he explains.He points to models used by the IIRR to disseminate information in rural communities, such as recruiting village leaders, religious figures, and even traditional healers to help spread public health messages. With the median age of sub-Saharan Africans sitting at 19, Williams highlights the need to recruit younger authority figures too. He argues against suggestions that Africa's younger demographic profile could shield the continent from the worst ravages of the virus, and instead underlines the threat from comorbidities, such as malnutrition and tuberculosis.Williams said that international institutions have a role to play alongside national governments to ensure resources were deployed to meet the basic needs of rural communities, such as water to enable hand washing. He believes that the outbreak could still be tackled in rural areas. \u201cYou need to halt the movement of people. I'm well aware of what that means\u2014it means you're grinding to a literal halt a national economy and the global economy. But that's sadly what's necessary. That's the bold action that is needed.\u201dDemographics also have a role to play when it comes to reacting to COVID-19 in rural areas within developed countries. Dr Sarah-Anne Munoz, Reader and Acting Head of the Division of Rural Health & Wellbeing at the University of the Highlands & Islands (UHI), UK, is concerned about the age profile of the population in the Scottish Highlands. \u201cIn the Highlands and islands in general, much higher proportions of our population are older\u201d, she explained. \u201cOne of the concerns about rural areas is that if we do get the virus then we are less able to treat it because we have fewer hospitals and other statutory healthcare facilities.\u201dMunoz was encouraged by community responses to the outbreak, including youngsters buying shopping for older people so they do not have to leave their homes. She highlighted the importance of community groups using digital methods to communicate with each other and the role that staying in touch online can play in counteracting feelings of isolation and other mental health issues during the lockdown, emphasising the need for good broadband and mobile phone connections. Munoz added: \u201cThey have experience of dealing with rural traumas, such as bushfires and draughts, so there are learnings we can share, particularly on mental health, about how they cope with community-wide trauma in rural areas\u201d.View Large Image\nCopyright \u00a9 2020 Flickr - La Priz", "S1473-30992030300-5": "Under-investment in public health-care system poses a challenge to India's COVID 19 containment plans. Patralekha Chatterje reports.The death toll due to the coronavirus virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in India was of 356 as of Apr 14, 2020. Since Mar 24, 2020, India has been under a nation-wide lockdown, now extended by the Government to at least May 3, to curb the spread of the new virus. India is not among the worst-hit countries, but its grossly under-funded and patchy public health system, with huge variations between different states, poses special challenges for the country's disease containment strategy. Over the past few weeks, there have been several reported instances of patients trying to flee isolation wards in government hospitals and hide travel history. Many with exposure to suspected cases of COVID-19 and infected persons have also tried to dodge the mandatory home quarantine.\u2022 View related content for this articleThese are worrying developments in the backdrop of India's latest containment plan, a 20-page document, which specifically talks about \u201cnon-pharmaceutical interventions\u201d. \u201cQuarantine and isolation are important mainstay of \u2018cluster containment,\u201d the document states. Quarantine refers to separation of individuals who are not yet ill but have been exposed to COVID-19 and therefore have a potential to become ill. Isolation refers to separation of individuals who are ill, suspected, or confirmed COVID-19 cases.There have been repeated reports of people escaping hospitals or quarantine in the past week. How can this impact the ongoing control measures for COVID 19? One key issue is the trust deficit in the public health system in many parts of the country. Other important factors include fear of isolation and stigma attached to those who are being quarantined and isolated.Epidemiologists and public health experts say that increasing expenditure in the public health system is key to building trust. \u201c[Escaping quarantine] is mostly out of fear and stigma, and wanting to be with one's family since it is for a prolonged time as well as lack of income. It is difficult for people in India to understand the importance of isolation and quarantine, even though it is a response to a pandemic. The faith in the public health system cannot emerge immediately as a response to the pandemic\u201d said Giridhara Babu, Head-Lifecourse Epidemiology at the Public Health Foundation of India.An overstretched public health-care system forces millions of Indians to turn to the unregulated private health-care sector. The Indian government's expenditure on health as a percentage of GDP still hovers around 1\u00b75%, one of the lowest in the world. For around 52% of households in urban areas, and 44% of households in rural areas, the private sector is the main source of health care when they are sick, according to government data.\u201cInfectious disease surveillance and in particular, the timely detection and early warning of disease outbreaks are a function of strength and capacity of the health system. This is the time to win the trust of people with a thoughtful approach. This can only be done by increasing the health expenditure by government as a percentage of GDP compared to what it is now and not just through health insurance. Creating a reliable system with a public health cadre will address these problems\u201d, Babu told The Lancet Infectious Diseases.Stigma has aggravated the problem. Thiagarajan Sundararaman, a global coordinator of the Peoples' Health Movement\u2014a worldwide network of grassroots health activists, points out that fear-based messaging can make a person feel that he or she is responsible for his and her disease. \u201cStigmatisation hampers persons from coming forward. The messaging should be emphasising that most persons would recover, but since there is a small risk, one should take some extra precautions to keep safe. Those who recover would be the greatest corona-warriors for the community\u201d, Sundararaman told The Lancet Infectious Diseases.The state of Kerala, which successfully dealt with a Nipah outbreak 2 years ago, offers useful lessons. \u201cCOVID 19 treatment is currently focused in government hospitals. In most parts of the country, these hospitals have been underfunded, not patronised by the rich and powerful; their staff are demoralised. This does not change overnight. Trust in government is an important component in an emergency health response. We saw what trust can do when we managed the Nipah response. Kerala has always been proud of the technical quality of its government hospitals. Since 2005, the state government investment has gone up considerably. Kerala government's The Aardram project has further raised the profile of government hospitals; substantial investments have been made\u201c. Rajeev Sadanandan, Chief Executive Officer, Health Systems Transformation Platform, told The Lancet Infectious Diseases.

Roxanne Nelson reports.As the pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) continues to thread its way around the globe, disruptions are occurring in healthcare, commerce, and travel, with countries closing off their borders. One of the less publicised consequences of the pandemic is its impact on the delivery of important health services, including immunisations, to populations residing in low and middle income countries.\u2022 View related content for this article\u201cThe magnitude of spread is unprecedented and is almost surreal\u201d, said Robin Nandy, Principal Advisor & Chief of Immunizations at UNICEF. \u201cIt is stretching the capacity of the healthcare system and we are seeing that in the United States, and it will become more exaggerated as it begins to hit middle and low income countries.\u201dUNICEF is the world's largest procurer of vaccines, but the COVID-19 outbreak threatens to disrupt immunisation and basic health services. \u201cObviously, when you have an outbreak like this and you have a large number of people seeking healthcare services, it does stretch existing capacity, and human and financial resources which are diverted to the response\u2014and appropriately so\u201d, Nandy said. \u201cWe have to deal with the emergency staring us in the face.\u201dThat said, Nandy emphasised that other concerns cannot be ignored, and that healthcare systems are being alerted not to let down their guard. \u201cTreatment services for malaria, pneumonia, and diarrhoea, for example, that kill large numbers of children globally, need to be kept up\u201d he said. \u201cWe want to make sure the response to COVID-19 also balances out with other health needs.\u201dBut immunisation services will be disrupted due to the interplay of multiple factors. One reason is that healthcare services are stretched and directed to other priorities, and a second factor is that because of social distancing recommendations, parents are not bringing their children to clinics. Another issue, Nandy explained, has to do with the supply chain, which is under historic strain due to transport disruptions. Flight cancellations and trade restrictions by countries, as well as closing borders, have severely constrained access to essential medicines, including vaccines.Preventive mass vaccination campaigns can also inadvertently contribute to COVID-19 spread, and UNICEF is recommending that these campaigns be suspended for now. But because immunisation campaigns are being suspended, there will be a need for \u201ccatch-up\u201d campaigns, to identify those who missed their immunisations as well as re-establishing community demand. \u201cWe have to be mindful of the secondary impact, as twice as many children died of measles than of Ebola, during the last Ebola outbreak\u201d, Nandy said.Niranjan Bhat, head of Vaccine Impact Research at the Center for Vaccine Innovation and Access at PATH, Seattle, Washington, USA, noted that vaccine disruptions have already been reported. \u201cIn Vietnam, there has been a full cessation of immunisations\u2014other than hepatitis B given at birth\u2014across the nation from April 1 to April 15\u201d, he said. \u201cIn Ghana, immunisation services have come to a halt in areas where movement restrictions are being enforced, while in other areas session sizes have been reduced, to limit overall group size and because some caregivers are hesitant to show up.\u201dThe partial lockdown in the main urban areas in countries such as Ghana and Zimbabwe has triggered an exodus of people, especially those living in informal settlements, back to their hometowns and other rural areas. As a result, their children are likely to miss their scheduled immunisations, resulting in reduced coverage. The large number of people returning to more rural areas has also put a strain on local health facilities that are less well-equipped to handle an influx of people.Bhat explained that India has instituted a full lockdown at the national level until at least April 14, and as a result, only essential and emergency medical services are operational for non-COVID19 related care in both public and private health facilities. \u201cBecause health personnel are redeployed to COVID-19 activities, no routine immunisations are happening\u201d, he said. \u201cRumors are also causing disruptions. In Liberia, for example, fear of coronavirus is elevating distrust of health information and about vaccines.\u201dCatch-up immunisation campaigns will be exceptionally important for countries such as Pakistan, one of the last nations endemic for polio, which is following guidance from the Global Polio Eradication Initiative that all countries should postpone all outbreak response campaigns until June 1. \u201cImmunisation registry data show significant drops in all vaccinations and a 20% absenteeism rate for vaccinators\u201d, he added. \u201cBut the bottom line is that it is critical to maintain momentum on immunisation\u2014both to ensure long-term progress toward health equity and to limit the impact of COVID-19.\u201dView Large Image\nCopyright \u00a9 2020 Flickr - EU Civil Protection and Humanitarian Aid", "S1473-30992030311-X": "The initial estimates of the case fatality rate of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) from China and the published modelled estimates both show a very strong age-dependence.1\n\n,  2\nIn the UK, this pattern has been interpreted in public health terms as advice to cocoon (ie, isolate) those older than 70 years and those with underlying health conditions\u2014but is this the right age cutoff?Applying the infection fatality rate ratios from new estimates (which assume a constant attack rate by age) to the age structure of the population of the UK,3\n\nwe can see how many deaths we would expect in each age group if there were 1 million infections (table).

The American Academy of Otolaryngology\u2014Head and Neck Surgery and the British Association of Otorhinolaryngology are now recommending these symptoms be added to the list of primary screening symptoms for COVID-19.Our understanding of an absent or diminished ability to smell or taste, resulting from a neurotropic or neurovirulent viral infection targeting the olfactory system, remains fragmentary and is largely historically informed. The clinical evaluation of the first cranial nerve (olfactory nerve or CN I) has all but dropped from history taking and physical examination; hence, it is often referred to by ENT professionals as the forgotten cranial nerve. To further complicate matters, immediate self-recognition of olfactory dysfunction is typically only present in the most severe cases, or it is only self-identified after a prolonged latency period.1\n,  2\nA scarcity of acute-phase advanced neuroimaging studies, difficulties in obtaining histopathological tissue specimens, and an absence of viral cultures of infected olfactory neuroepithelium compound the difficulties in studying this phenomenon. Moreover, in the context of normal trans-nasal airflow of odorant molecules (ie, no oedema in the nasal vault or olfactory cleft), and in the absence of intranasal disease (eg, infectious rhinosinusitis, allergic or vasomotor rhinitis, or polyposis), until now patients with sensorineural viral anosmia have been seldom seen in general otolaryngology practice\u2014on the order of approximately one to two new-onset patients each year. Hence, up until the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, the low prevalence of sensorineural viral anosmia in society as a whole has made clinical research challenging.\u2022 View related content for this articleGiven the urgency and lethality of the current pandemic, knowledge obtained from front-line otolaryngologists who are currently managing and monitoring patients with COVID-19, and those with clinical experience in olfaction and rhinology, would have great value when transferred forward to deployed caregivers. Our multinational group, including one otolaryngologist currently infected with COVID-19 and experiencing anosmia and dysgeusia, suggest that physicians evaluating patients with acute-onset loss of smell or taste, particularly in the context of a patent nasal airway (ie, non-conductive loss), should have a high index of suspicion for concomitant SARS-CoV-2 infection. We have observed that traditional nasal cavity manifestations, as seen in other upper respiratory infections (eg, rhinovirus, influenza, and adenovirus), are commonly absent in patients with COVID-19. We have also observed that SARS-CoV-2 does not appear to generate clinically significant nasal congestion or rhinorrhoea\u2014ie, a red, runny, stuffy, itchy nose. This observation suggests a neurotropic virus that is site-specific for the olfactory system. Although labelled as a respiratory virus, coronaviruses are known to be neurotropic and neuroinvasive.3\n,  4\n,  5\n,  6\nFinally, we and others7\nhave observed that anosmia, with or without dysgeusia, manifests either early in the disease process or in patients with mild or no constitutional symptoms.Nevertheless, it is still too early in our understanding of COVID-19 to definitively establish the incidence, as well as the full-spectrum clinical utility, of these symptoms.We declare no competing interests.

In the USA, a rapid increase in SARS-CoV-2 infections in every state of the country has resulted in a growing number of hospitalisations, admissions to intensive care units, and deaths in specific age groups and in many people with underlying medical conditions.1\u2022 View related content for this articleIndividuals who are incarcerated, including immigrants in ICE detention, are among the most vulnerable to infection and complicated disease because of existing drivers of inequality.2\n,  3\nThe incarceration of undocumented immigrants is a relatively new phenomenon in the USA. The annual average daily population in ICE detention has risen more than seven times in the past 25 years to a peak of more than 50\u2008000 individuals in 2019.4\n\nMany individuals in ICE detention have never been charged with a criminal offense. Immigrants in ICE detention around the country have expressed panic over conditions that put them at exceptionally high risk of an outbreak of COVID-19 and proposed an immediate humanitarian response to mitigate the risk of infection.5\n\nRapid implementation of infection prevention and control measures in immigration detention is essential to the wider national public health response. Although people who are incarcerated are confined, a high degree of interaction occurs between people in facilities and the community, including people being transported between facilities, releases and new intakes that generate a population turnover, and the comings and goings of staff, visitors, vendors, and contractors. Inadequate implementation of infection prevention strategies will affect the spread of COVID-19 in the community and burden an already stretched health-care system.Because the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is predominantly from person to person through droplets, a pillar of infection prevention is social distancing and disinfection, which is antithetical to closed detention settings. Incarceration requires large groups of people to be held together in confined and often poorly ventilated spaces. Many areas within the facility are communal, including housing, waiting rooms, eating areas, recreation spaces, and classrooms. Disinfection and decontamination practices are also complicated by the ability of SARS-CoV-2 to survive for extended periods on materials that are highly prevalent in detention settings, such as metals and other non-porous surfaces.From a public health perspective, mitigation strategies in detention facilities should be complemented by routine screening and containment procedures. These entail screening all people who enter facilities, including individuals in detention, staff, visitors, and vendors, and quarantining those who screen positive for COVID-19 exposure. People who screen positive for symptoms on intake or develop symptoms during detention must be medically isolated and receive appropriate medical care. ICE facilities do not have the staffing capacity or facilities to screen, quarantine to monitor for symptoms, isolate infected individuals, or deliver medical management in a setting with high rate of infection.6Clinical deterioration, often rapid with COVID-19, will require the rapid transfer of individuals with COVID-19 to local medical facilities for specialised care that might exceed the capacity of local health-care systems, particularly in the rural and semi-rural settings where many ICE detention facilities are located. The combination of a captive population exposed to a highly infectious disease and substandard care has the potential to increase the incidence of infection and case-fatality rates among detained individuals, put the public at greater risk, and consume substantial medical and financial resources.Because of the existing barriers to adequate mitigation, containment, and provision of medical care in detention facilities, the policy response to this crisis must involve the release of individuals in ICE detention and a halt of ICE enforcement action in the community. These actions should include the immediate release on humanitarian parole of individuals at risk of severe disease and death due to COVID-19 infection. An even more robust and effective response would be to release all individuals who do not represent a threat to public safety. This does not represent amnesty, but rather the use of existing structures within the DHS and the US Department of Justice to enforce immigration laws in the community setting.As physician advocates, we believe that prompt action in this brief and rapidly closing window represents not only the humanitarian and moral course, but also the best public health intervention to prevent unnecessary deaths.We declare no competing interests.", "S1473-30992030297-8": "Early and accurate diagnosis of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection is key to the management of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Following its emergence in China in December, 2019, SARS-CoV-2 has spread in the northern hemisphere during the winter season, when other respiratory viruses, including influenza, co-circulate. This epidemiological conjunction complicates clinical diagnosis of COVID-19 because patients often present with influenza-like illness (ILI). Consequently, the definite diagnosis of COVID-19 mostly relies on positive RT-PCR on respiratory samples, although discriminant features have been reported on thoracic CT scan.1\nHowever, access to these diagnostic tests is limited in the context of this large-scale pandemic. Distinctive clinical features would be welcome to better select patients who require investigations. During the early phase of the COVID-19 outbreak in France, we noticed that many patients reported loss of smell (hyposmia) and taste (hypogeusia). We aimed to investigate the diagnostic value of these symptoms.Rennes, Angers, and Nantes are referral centres for emerging infectious diseases in western France (population catchment area includes 5 million inhabitants). The study was done from March 15\u201318, 2020, at which time there was no public awareness of the potential link between taste or smell disorders and COVID-19 (the first report2\nwas on March 21). All patients who underwent tests for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR on nasopharyngeal samples since Feb 16 were invited by e-mail or telephone to complete a web-based questionnaire comprised of four questions: Have you been diagnosed with COVID-19 following diagnostic screening? Did you notice a loss of smell during your disease? Did you notice a loss of taste? Do you regularly suffer from ear, nose, and throat (ENT) disorders? The study was approved by the Rennes University Hospital institutional review board. Informed consent was waiived.\u2022 View related content for this articleOf the 452 patients contacted, 259 (57%) replied, of whom 68 (26%) reported a positive test for SARS-CoV-2. Hypogeusia was reported by 63 patients (24%), hyposmia by 51 patients (20%), both hypogeusia and hyposmia by 43 patients (17%), and ENT disorders by 82 patients (32%). Hypogeusia and hyposmia were strongly associated with COVID-19 diagnosis, separately and combined, in patients with and without a medical history of ENT disorders (appendix p 2). The best performance was obtained with the combination of hypogeusia and hyposmia in patients with no medical history of ENT disorders, with a sensitivity of 42% (95% CI 27\u201358) and a specificity of 95% (90\u201398; appendix p 2).To our knowledge, this is the first report of discriminant clinical features that might be used for the diagnosis of COVID-19 in patients with ILI. Taste and smell disorders have been associated with herpes zoster and HIV.3\n,  4\nThe neuroinvasive potential of SARS-CoV-2 might have a role in the pathophysiology of hypogeusia and hyposmia.5\nAs the olfactory mucosa is located in the upper region of the nasal cavity, a direct or indirect effect of SARS-CoV-2 in situ might be another explanation for these symptoms. The prevalence of taste and smell disorders in patients with COVID-19 was estimated to be 5% in a previous study;6\nhowever, the data were retrospectively collected from medical files, which might have led to underestimation of the real prevalence. Indeed, these symptoms might not be spontaneously reported if not searched for.This study has limitations. First, data were retrospectively collected through a web-based questionnaire, and we collected no data on age, sex, or other symptoms. Second, data were collected anonymously, so we could not check the accuracy of the diagnosis reported by patients. Third, the sample size was small and the response rate suboptimal. Finally, as the diagnosis relied on detection of SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR on nasopharyngeal samples, suboptimal sensitivity of this test (as low as 60% in some reports) might have led to misclassification and diagnostic bias.7\nHowever, this preliminary report of an association between hypogeusia or hyposmia and COVID-19 diagnosis in patients with ILI suggests that these symptoms might be a useful tool for initial diagnostic work-up in patients with suspected COVID-19. These symptoms, which are easy to collect, could be used for mass screening, by professionals with limited medical knowledge, and through telemedicine. Larger prospective studies are required to confirm these preliminary findings.We declare no competing interests.", "S1473-30992030285-1": "With interest, we read the guidelines by Guillaume Favre and colleagues1\non the management of pregnant women with suspected severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection.We found the Correspondence and the proposed algorithm very helpful as we face the early and late phases of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic worldwide. The clinical algorithm proposed by Favre and colleagues has provided us with a clear and understandable way of guiding our clinical practice. Recently, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) provided recommendations for breastfeeding in special circumstances, specifically for COVID-19. The CDC suggests washing hands before touching the baby; wearing a face mask, if possible, while feeding at the breast; washing hands before touching the pump or bottle parts; and cleaning all parts after each use.2\n\nWe think women should be permitted to breastfeed, if possible, unless future evidence suggests otherwise.

The described mechanism affecting viral endocytosis mediated by two members of the numb-associated kinase family is one of the many unfamiliar effects of a relatively recent drug class, the real safety profile of which still remains to be definitively clarified. Undoubtedly, the fact that baricitinib can provide this antiviral effect at the approved dose for rheumatoid arthritis therapy is an undeniable advantage over other potential inhibitors of the same pathway.However, some concern could arise from the best-known aspects of the mechanism of action of the drug and its safety profile. Interferon is one of the most powerful innate immune responses to prevent viral replication during the early phases of infection. Transcription through the JAK\u2013STAT signalling pathway (mainly mediated by JAK1 and JAK2), activated by interferons, leads to the upregulation of many interferon-controlled genes that quickly kill viruses in infected cells. The importance of this defense mechanism is confirmed by the fact that most viruses have developed strategies to counteract the effects of interferons by blocking their signalling pathway, and viral-encoded factors that antagonise the JAK\u2013STAT pathway are crucial determinants of virulence.2\nAs a consequence, JAK\u2013STAT signal blocking by baricitinib (a selective JAK1 and JAK2 inhibitor) produces an impairment of interferon-mediated antiviral response, with a potential facilitating effect on the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 infection. This mechanism is thought to be involved in an increased risk of herpes zoster and simplex infection, which was reported in the development programme of baricitinib 4 mg compared with placebo (herpes zoster 4\u00b72 per 100 person-years vs 1\u00b70 per 100 person-years [p<0\u00b705]; herpes simplex 5\u00b74 per 100 person-years vs 2\u00b72 per 100 person-years [p<0\u00b705]).3\nNotably, this complication also seems to be shared by the new JAK1 selective inhibitors upadacitinib and filgotinib.4\nViral infections (including herpes zoster and herpes simplex) in intensive care units can account for up to 10% of community-acquired and up to 5% of ventilator-associated pneumonia,5\nthe incidence of which might be expected to be higher in immunocompromised patients given JAK inhibitors.\u2022 View related content for this articleIn conclusion, we believe that, beyond the intriguing opportunity to directly block the penetration of SARS-CoV-2 into the cell, the use of baricitinib in susceptible patients with ongoing pneumonia associated with COVID-19 should be considered with extreme caution.We declare no competing interests.", "S1473-30992030270-X": "We thank Ennio Favalli and colleagues for their Correspondence regarding our suggestion to use baricitinib for the treatment of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections.1\n,  2\nWe also appreciate their recognition that inhibition of numb-associated kinase enzymes could indeed be beneficial in preventing virus infectivity via inhibition of clathrin-mediated endocytosis.We welcome the opportunity to more fully explain the possible use of baricitinib in the current pandemic. Indeed, we accept that using a JAK1 and JAK2 inhibitor to treat a viral disease might appear illogical given that the antiviral effects of interferons are largely mediated by the JAK\u2013STAT signalling pathway. However, the administration of pegylated-interferon has not had the beneficial antiviral effects originally hoped for,4\nand clinical trials with interferons have yielded inconsistent results, with pathogenic effects of interferons being observed in some viral infections.\u2022 View related content for this articleWe speculate here that in early asymptomatic disease and stages of the disease not requiring admittance to hospital, approximately 80% of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are able to clear the virus, largely through endogenous antiviral mechanisms, almost certainly including the interferons. Therefore, we do not recommend that baricitinib or other JAK inhibitors be given to these individuals. However, in patients with moderate disease requiring hospital care, the peak SARS-CoV-2 load occurs within approximately 7 days of symptom onset, and later, as the viral titre decreases in some patients, hyper-inflammation causes the severe phase of the disease,5\nakin to a so-called cytokine storm. This clinically severe phase is accompanied by high levels of signalling, including increased levels of interferons \u03b1 and \u03b2 and IL-6, all of which signal through the JAK\u2013STAT pathway. In a microarray study by Cameron and colleagues,3\nthe authors intriguingly showed that patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) who had been discharged from hospital had low interferon \u03b1 and interferon \u03b3 signalling activity, whereas in those with hypoxaemia who had died, interferon \u03b1 and interferon \u03b3 signalling was prominent. In animal models designed to understand the temporal profiles of the SARS and Middle East respiratory syndrome diseases, the authors showed that interferon \u03b1 and interferon \u03b2 action early in the disease was beneficial, but it was damaging in the later stages.4This finding suggests that when hospital care is required for patients with a pathogenic SARS-CoV-2 infection, JAK\u2013STAT pathway inhibition might be a potential strategy. In the current outbreak, we need to understand which patients might benefit from treatment with such cytokine inhibitors and whether more than one pattern of disease progression exists; stratification and prognostic models are required. Additionally, we need to identify the optimum time to administer cytokine inhibitors, which requires identification of appropriate biomarkers.5\nAnecdotal experience suggests that the short time baricitinib might be used (duration of doses is 7\u201314 days) will not cause reactivation of any latent infections, such as herpes viruses or tuberculosis.We and others are awaiting the results of investigator-led and other prospective studies (eg, NCT04320277 and NCT04321993) with numerous treatments, including baricitinib, in individuals with COVID-19. Because of the single-arm nature of such studies, data might be difficult to interpret, and we caution against headlines of a so-called cure when most infected individuals will recover. We also suggest that the systemic administration of interferons \u03b1 and \u03b2 to patients being treated in hospital might be harmful and explains why previous studies with interferons have yielded inconsistent results. Although we have ongoing concerns regarding the design of, and the drugs used in, the multicountry WHO SOLIDARITY trial (NCT04321616), which includes use of interferon \u03b2, the reality is that all of these opinions, however valid, only lend credence to the evidence-based view that the optimal data are ultimately best obtained from randomised controlled trials.PJR is an employee of Benevolent AI.

One study, based on 291 patients in China, estimated a median incubation period of 4 days, and another four studies estimated the incubation period of cases outside Wuhan or Hubei ranging from 5 to 6\u00b77 days. One mathematical modelling study estimated that the median daily net reproduction number in Wuhan declined from 2\u00b735 (95% CI 1\u00b715\u20134\u00b777) 1 week before travel restrictions were introduced on Jan 23 to 1\u00b705 (0\u00b741\u20132\u00b739) 1 week after. A report from the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention that was based on the analysis of 44\u2008672 confirmed cases up to Feb 11, 2020, provided an overall description of the characteristics of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases in China as a whole and in Hubei province. However, that study did not provide estimates of key time-to-event intervals nor of the reproduction number. Until now, there has been scarce information to understand the changing epidemiological features and transmission dynamics of the COVID-19 outbreak beyond Hubei province.\nAdded value of this study\nWe collected individual information from official, publicly available sources on 8579 laboratory-confirmed cases detected outside Hubei province up to Feb 17, accounting for 69% of all 12\u2008447 reported cases at that time. We analysed changes in demographic characteristics, key time-to-event intervals (eg, incubation period, serial interval, and time from symptom onset to hospital admission), and the dynamics of the net reproduction number (Rt) at the provincial level. We found significant differences in the epidemiology of COVID-19 as the epidemic continued to spread across China. The time from symptom onset to hospital admission decreased from 4\u00b74 days (95% CI 0\u00b70\u201314\u00b70) in the period of Dec 24 to Jan 27, to 2\u00b76 days (0\u00b70\u20139\u00b70) in the period from Jan 28 to Feb 17. The mean incubation period was estimated at 5\u00b72 days (95% CI 1\u00b78\u201312\u00b74) and the mean serial interval at 5\u00b71 days (1\u00b73\u201311\u00b76). Most importantly, as of Feb 8, 2020, we estimated Rt to be below the epidemic threshold in provinces outside Hubei that have reported the largest number of cases (Hunan, Shandong, Shenzhen city [Guangdong province], Anhui, Henan, Jiangsu, Jiangxi, Shaanxi, and Zhejiang).\nImplications of all the available evidence\nWe show that the epidemiology and transmission dynamics of the COVID-19 epidemic are rapidly changing and should be closely monitored. Our findings suggest that strict containment measures, movement restrictions, and increased awareness of the population might have contributed to controlling the COVID-19 outbreak outside Hubei province in China. Given that the reproduction number is positively related to the growth rate of the epidemic and the length of the serial interval, the shorter serial interval estimated here (5\u00b71 days vs 7\u00b75 days) implies that transmissibility of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 might not be as high as previous estimates suggest. More broadly, our findings are crucial to inform intervention policy in real-time for other countries, given the international expansion of the COVID-19 epidemic.Evidence before this studyOn March 12, 2020, we searched PubMed and Web of Science for papers published after Jan 1, 2020, using the search terms (\u201cnCoV\u201d OR \u201cCOVID\u201d OR \u201cnovel coronavirus\u201d OR \u201csevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2\u201d) AND (\u201cevolving epidemiology\u201d OR \u201cepidemiological characteristics\u201d OR \u201ctransmission dynamics\u201d OR \u201cnet reproduction number\u201d). No language restrictions were applied. We identified 24 papers published in peer-reviewed journals. We also included two relevant papers that had yet to be indexed by PubMed or Web of Science.

However, that study did not provide estimates of key time-to-event intervals nor of the reproduction number. Until now, there has been scarce information to understand the changing epidemiological features and transmission dynamics of the COVID-19 outbreak beyond Hubei province.Added value of this studyWe collected individual information from official, publicly available sources on 8579 laboratory-confirmed cases detected outside Hubei province up to Feb 17, accounting for 69% of all 12\u2008447 reported cases at that time. We analysed changes in demographic characteristics, key time-to-event intervals (eg, incubation period, serial interval, and time from symptom onset to hospital admission), and the dynamics of the net reproduction number (Rt) at the provincial level. We found significant differences in the epidemiology of COVID-19 as the epidemic continued to spread across China. The time from symptom onset to hospital admission decreased from 4\u00b74 days (95% CI 0\u00b70\u201314\u00b70) in the period of Dec 24 to Jan 27, to 2\u00b76 days (0\u00b70\u20139\u00b70) in the period from Jan 28 to Feb 17. The mean incubation period was estimated at 5\u00b72 days (95% CI 1\u00b78\u201312\u00b74) and the mean serial interval at 5\u00b71 days (1\u00b73\u201311\u00b76). Most importantly, as of Feb 8, 2020, we estimated Rt to be below the epidemic threshold in provinces outside Hubei that have reported the largest number of cases (Hunan, Shandong, Shenzhen city [Guangdong province], Anhui, Henan, Jiangsu, Jiangxi, Shaanxi, and Zhejiang).Implications of all the available evidenceWe show that the epidemiology and transmission dynamics of the COVID-19 epidemic are rapidly changing and should be closely monitored. Our findings suggest that strict containment measures, movement restrictions, and increased awareness of the population might have contributed to controlling the COVID-19 outbreak outside Hubei province in China. Given that the reproduction number is positively related to the growth rate of the epidemic and the length of the serial interval, the shorter serial interval estimated here (5\u00b71 days vs 7\u00b75 days) implies that transmissibility of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 might not be as high as previous estimates suggest. More broadly, our findings are crucial to inform intervention policy in real-time for other countries, given the international expansion of the COVID-19 epidemic.We aimed to describe the epidemiological characteristics of the COVID-19 outbreak 50 days after it was recognised in Chinese provinces outside Hubei. We also estimated changes in key time-to-event intervals and reproduction numbers to assess whether the strict control measures put in place in China have been successful in slowing transmission.Case definitions and surveillanceSince the outbreak of COVID-19 was first detected in Wuhan, the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (China CDC) has launched a new surveillance system, first in Wuhan, then extended to the entire country, to record information about COVID-19 cases (appendix pp 2\u20133).1\n\n,  5\nGuidelines on the diagnosis and treatment of patients with novel coronavirus-infected pneumonia (NCIP) were published, with the first issued on Jan 15, 2020, defining a suspected NCIP case as pneumonia that fulfilled specific clinical criteria and had an epidemiological link to the Huanan seafood wholesale market in Wuhan or had travelled to Wuhan in the 14 days before symptom onset (appendix pp 2\u20133). The subsequent two versions of the guidelines (the first issued on Jan 18 and the second on Jan 22) removed the clinical criterion of no symptomatic improvement or deterioration after 3 days of antibiotic treatment to accelerate identification of cases. Additionally, the epidemiological link was revised to include travel history to Wuhan, direct contact with patients from Wuhan who had fever or respiratory symptoms within 14 days before symptom onset, or part of a COVID-19 cluster. In the fourth version of the guidelines (issued on Jan 27), the clinical criteria were broadened to meet any two of the three remaining clinical criteria (ie, fever, radiographic findings of pneumonia, and normal or reduced white blood cell count or reduced lymphocyte count at early stage of illness), and an epidemiological criterion was added (link with a confirmed COVID-19 case). In the fifth version issued on Feb 4, clinically diagnosed cases were defined as suspected cases with radiographic findings of pneumonia, to be used exclusively in Hubei.7This study was approved by the institutional review board of the School of Public Health, Fudan University (Shanghai, China). All data were collected from publicly available sources. Data were deidentified, and informed consent was waived.All of the provinces outside Hubei were included in the analysis of demographic characteristics, key time-to-event intervals, incubation period, and serial interval. Nine locations for which we had sufficient data coverage were used to estimate the net reproduction number.Daily aggregated data on the number of cumulative cases in mainland China were extracted from the official websites of national, provincial, and municipal health commissions (appendix pp 3\u201310). Individual records on laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases were collected from two publicly available official sources: the websites of national, provincial, and municipal health commissions, and the websites of national and local government news media. Individual information was extracted by the data collection team and entered into a structured database comprising three sections: demographic characteristics; exposure and travel history; and key timelines, including exposure timeline, date of symptom onset, date of hospital admission, and date of official reporting. A well trained data collection team of about 40 members from Fudan University collected individual information (appendix pp 10, 11). Each individual record was cross-checked by three coauthors (WW, MLi, and WZ), and consensus was attained before finalising an entry in the database. Conflicting information was resolved based on the original data source; for example, if individual records on local governmental websites and governmental news media were inconsistent, we extracted the data from the governmental website. We used information on age, sex, location of detection, exposure history, dates of symptom onset, hospital admission, and official reporting to describe demographic characteristics of cases and estimate key time-to-event intervals, incubation period, serial interval, and net reproduction number. Details on the collection of individual data, the definitions of key variables, and the assessment of completeness of variables are provided in the appendix (pp 3\u201311).We validated our individual records against the official line lists obtained from the websites of Shandong Provincial Health Commission, Shenzhen Municipal Health Commission, and Hunan Provincial Health Commission (appendix p 12).We restricted analyses to provinces other than Hubei where the majority of individual records were available\u2014ie, 8579 (98%) of 8738. We used the date of the fourth revision of the guidelines to divide the epidemic into two time periods. The first period ran from the emergence of COVID-19 in provinces outside Hubei, Dec 24 to Jan 27, when the definition of suspected cases was broadened to capture milder cases. The second period ran from Jan 28 to Feb 17. We did statistical analyses of demographic and epidemiological characteristics of confirmed cases stratified by the two epidemic periods. \u03c72 test was used to compare the age and sex structure. Two-sample t test was used to compare the key time-to-event intervals.We estimated key time-to-event distributions for COVID-19 cases, including symptom onset to first health-care consultation, hospital admission, and official reporting. We estimated the time from infection to symptom onset (ie, the incubation period) by analysing COVID-19 cases with confirmed epidemiological links (clusters) identified by prospective contact tracing. The date of presumed infection was estimated from history of exposure, after excluding cases with exposure to Wuhan. When multiple exposures were reported, we considered the interval between the first and last recorded dates of exposure. We fit three parametric distributions (Weibull, gamma, and lognormal) to time-to-event data and selected the best fit based on the minimum Akaike information criterion. Confidence intervals for the estimated distributions were obtained with 2000 bootstrap simulations for either censored or non-censored data.We analysed clusters of COVID-19 cases with epidemiological links confirmed by prospective contact tracing (all cases with travel history to Wuhan or Hubei\u2014ie, declared visiting or residing, where excluded) to estimate the interval between onset of symptoms in a primary (index) case and the onset of symptoms in secondary cases generated by that primary case (ie, the serial interval). The serial interval was estimated by fitting a gamma distribution to the lag between the dates of symptom onset in the index and secondary cases.Using the estimated distribution of the serial interval, we calculated the net reproduction number (Rt), which is the mean number of secondary cases generated by a typical primary case at time t. Consecutive generations of cases arise after a period measured by the serial interval or by the generation time.8\nWe used a Bayesian approach9\n\n,  10\nto estimate Rt from the time series of symptom onset dates and the distribution of the serial interval, considering importations and local transmission.11\nFor this analysis, the last 9 days of the dataset were excluded to account for the possible incompleteness of the dataset due to reporting delays. The methods used to estimate Rt are reported in detail in the appendix (p 23). Throughout, 95% CI refers to the 2\u00b75th and 97\u00b75th percentiles of the estimated distribution. Statistical analyses were done using R, version 3.6.0. Rt was estimated from a code written by the authors, which is available online.The funder of the study had no role in the study design, data collection, data analysis, data interpretation, or writing of the report. The corresponding authors had full access to all the data in the study and had final responsibility for the decision to submit for publication.As of Feb 17, 2020, 72\u2008436 COVID-19 cases had been reported in all 31 provinces of mainland China. 42\u2008752 (59%) of 72\u2008436 cases were detected in Wuhan city of Hubei province, 17\u2008237 (24%) were detected in cities other than Wuhan in Hubei province, and 12\u2008447 (17%) were reported in other provinces (figure 1A). We collected individual information on 8579 laboratory-confirmed cases detected outside Hubei up to Feb 17, accounting for 69% of the 12\u2008447 cases reported at that time. For most of the locations, there was consistency between the time series derived from our individual records and the official case reports (appendix pp 12\u201314).\nFigure 1Geographical distribution and temporal dynamics of confirmed COVID-19 cases\nShow full caption\nView Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Starting at the end of December, 2019, the COVID-19 epidemic grew rapidly outside Hubei and was characterised by a mixture of local transmission and case importations from Hubei (figure 1B). The median age of cases was 44 years (33\u201356), with the proportions of cases that were in age groups younger than 18 years (p<0\u00b70001) and older than 64 years (p<0\u00b70001) increasing from the earlier to the more recent time periods (appendix p 15). Overall, the proportion of cases among individuals younger than 18 years was low (5%; table 1). The proportion of male cases decreased between the two epidemic periods (p=0\u00b700012), but remained around 50% (table 1; appendix p 15).\nTable 1Characteristics of laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases in provinces outside Hubei in mainland China by epidemic period, as of Feb 17, 2020\nAll (n=8579) Period 1 (Dec 24 to Jan 27; n=4210) Period 2 (Jan 28 to Feb 17; n=2379) Unclassified*\n(n=1990)\nAge, years 44 (33\u201356) 43 (33\u201355) 46 (33\u201358) 44 (31\u201356)\nAge group, years\n0\u20136 124/8579 (1%) 28/4210 (1%) 44/2379 (2%) 52/1990 (3%)\n7\u201317 233/8579 (3%) 65/4210 (2%) 81/2379 (3%) 87/1990 (4%)\n18\u201324 477/8579 (6%) 248/4210 (6%) 106/2379 (4%) 123/1990 (6%)\n25\u201349 4127/8579 (48%) 2147/4210 (51%) 1082/2379 (45%) 898/1990 (45%)\n50\u201364 2113/8579 (25%) 990/4210 (24%) 631/2379 (27%) 492/1990 (25%)\n\u226565 1002/8579 (12%) 394/4210 (9%) 373/2379 (16%) 235/1990 (12%)\nSex\nFemale 3943/8579 (46%) 1841/4210 (44%) 1163/2379 (49%) 939/1990 (47%)\nMale 4401/8579 (51%) 2258/4210 (54%) 1166/2379 (49%) 977/1990 (49%)\nExposure history\nPresence of at least one exposure 6611/8579 (77%)\u2020\n3342/4210 (79%) 1708/2379 (72%) 1561/1990 (78%)\nExposure to animals and seafood markets, or wild animals 34/6611 (1%) 23/3342 (1%) 7/1708 (0%) 4/1561 (0%)\nExposure to COVID-19 cases or patients with acute respiratory infections 2978/6611 (45%) 855/3342 (26%) 1125/1708 (66%) 998/1561 (64%)\nExposure to Wuhan or Hubei 3672/6611 (56%) 2428/3342 (73%) 591/1708 (35%) 653/1561 (42%)\nResidence in Wuhan\u2021\n1602/3672 (44%) 1135/2428 (47%) 216/591 (37%) 251/653 (38%)\nVisited Wuhan 577/3672 (16%) 413/2428 (17%) 96/591 (16%) 68/653 (10%)\nResidence in Hubei or visit Hubei\u00a7\n519/3672 (14%) 222/2428 (9%) 153/591 (26%) 144/653 (22%)\nData are median (IQR), or n/n (%).

In the early epidemic period, most cases reported an exposure in Wuhan or Hubei. Subsequently, an increasing number of cases reported exposure to COVID-19 cases or patients with acute respiratory infections (p<0\u00b70001; table 1).The time from symptom onset to hospital admission shortened as the epidemic progressed, decreasing from 4\u00b74 days (95% CI 0\u00b70\u201314\u00b70) during the first period of the epidemic to 2\u00b76 days (0\u00b70\u20139\u00b70) in the second period (table 2).

These cases represented 37 clusters. We estimated a mean incubation period of 5\u00b72 days (95% CI 1\u00b78\u201312\u00b74), with the 95th percentile of the distribution at 10\u00b75 days. The incubation period was well approximated by a lognormal distribution (appendix pp 17\u201319).We analysed the time between symptom onset in 35 secondary cases and 28 corresponding primary cases (appendix pp 19\u201322). One case who reported the onset of symptoms on the same day as the index case was removed from the analysis. The serial interval followed a gamma distribution with an estimated mean of 5\u00b71 days (95% CI 1\u00b73\u201311\u00b76). A comparison of the distribution of the incubation period and the serial interval is reported in figure 2, and shows overlap between the two distributions. As we cannot exclude that a fraction of these secondary cases had a previous exposure to an unidentified infection source, we did a sensitivity analysis using different levels of data censoring; the resulting estimates were between 5\u00b70 days (0\u00b78\u201313\u00b70) and 6\u00b73 days (3\u00b72\u201310\u00b75; appendix p 22).\nFigure 2Distributions of the incubation period and serial interval\nShow full caption\nView Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The transmission dynamics of COVID-19 differed between provinces outside Hubei. Here we report the results for a city (Shenzhen\u2014a major city with more than 12 million inhabitants in Guangdong province) and two provinces (Hunan and Shandong) for which we have validated our individual records against the full official line lists (appendix pp 3\u20138). Results for the other six locations are included in the appendix (p 24). Although these locations were among those that reported the largest number of COVID-19 cases as of Feb 17, 2020,3\n\nthey showed highly different transmission patterns. Specifically, in Shenzhen, we estimated that the mean Rt was above the epidemic threshold for about 1 week (approximately from Jan 18 to Jan 23), with a maximum value of 1\u00b708 (95% CI 0\u00b774\u20131\u00b754) on Jan 22, and the outbreak was mostly sustained by cases with travel history to or from Wuhan or Hubei (figure 3). In Hunan province, we estimated the mean Rt to be above the epidemic threshold for about 2 weeks from Jan 13 to Jan 28, with a peak value of 1\u00b734 on Jan 20 (1\u00b706\u20131\u00b768; figure 3). Shandong province showed a slightly longer epidemic period than Hunan characterised by sustained local transmission and a larger peak mean Rt of 1\u00b771 on Jan 23 (1\u00b732\u20132\u00b717; figure 3). In these three locations, the mean Rt steadily decreased and has remained below the epidemic threshold since the end of January, 2020. In general, we found that in all the analysed areas (among the most affected provinces outside Hubei), Rt had decreased below 1\u00b70 from Feb 8.\nFigure 3Temporal dynamics of Rt in three Chinese locations outside Hubei\nShow full caption\nView Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)We have provided an assessment of the rapidly changing epidemiology and transmission dynamics of the COVID-19 outbreak beyond Hubei province in mainland China. We found significant differences in the epidemiology of COVID-19 as the epidemic continued to spread across China. We estimated that, as of Feb 8, 2020, Rt has been below the epidemic threshold in the nine locations for which we had sufficient data coverage, which were among those with the largest number of reported cases (outside Hubei). This finding suggests that China has made key steps towards the interruption of COVID-19 transmission, owing to stringent containment measures, including isolation of cases, quarantine of contacts, and strict restrictions on personal movement (appendix pp 26\u201330), as well as to increased awareness and behavioural change of the population.At the beginning of the epidemic, COVID-19 cases were mostly observed among elderly people.12\nAs the epidemic progressed, we observed a further increase in number of cases among people aged 65 years and older, as well as an increase among younger individuals (<18 years). Since Jan 28, 2020, however, the proportion of confirmed cases that are in people younger than 18 years is still only about 5%, although this age group represents approximately 20% of the Chinese population.13\n\nFrom the data available here, it is not possible to ascertain whether younger individuals have a reduced risk of infection or an increased propensity for a milder clinical outcome of infection (thus resulting in a lower rate of detection). Schools in China were closed for most of the epidemic because of the 2020 Chinese New Year holidays;14\n\ngiven studies15\nshowing that children record the largest number of contacts among all age groups on a regular weekday due to contacts at schools, it is possible that children were less exposed than normal during this time. It is unclear whether nationwide school holidays contributed to the low proportion of confirmed COVID-19 cases among school-age individuals and whether reopening of schools will lead to a change in the transmission patterns of COVID-19.16At the beginning of the epidemic, a disproportionate fraction of COVID-19 cases were male.12\nAs of Feb 17, 2020, however, we observed about the same number of cases among men and women (51% of cases are male). This finding suggests either differential exposure by sex occurring at the beginning of the epidemic (most cases reported possible exposure to live markets because they were shop owners, or worked at or visited the live markets17\n,  18\n) or possible bias in the detection of the first few cases.In provinces outside Hubei, we estimated the mean incubation period to be 5\u00b72 days, in agreement with previous studies,5\n,  19\n,  20\n,  21\nalthough estimates between 4\u00b70 and 6\u00b77 days have been reported.22\n,  23\nThe 95th percentile of the distribution (10\u00b75 days) suggests contact tracing and medical observations of contacts of people with COVID-19 are important to detect individuals with a long incubation period. In these provinces, the mean serial interval was 5\u00b71 days (95% CI 1\u00b73\u201311\u00b76). This estimate is considerably shorter than a previous estimate (7\u00b75 days) derived from an analysis of six observations of the serial interval in Wuhan.5\nGiven that the basic reproduction number is positively associated with the growth rate of the epidemic and the length of the serial interval,8\nthe shorter mean serial interval estimated here implies that transmissibility might not be as high as initial estimates suggest. We cannot rule out, however, that the serial interval might differ between Wuhan and other Chinese provinces. The short estimate of the serial interval that we obtained might be linked to the short estimate for the interval from symptom onset to hospital admission (with a mean of about 2\u00b76 days since Jan 28) for mainland China outside Hubei. A longer admission delay was reported in Wuhan in the early phase of the outbreak,5\nwhich could drive longer serial intervals. It should be stressed also that serial interval estimates based on household clusters might be up to 20% shorter than the true value, as suggested by a theoretical study.10We estimated that the serial interval was about as long as the incubation period, which is in overall agreement with an independent previous estimate.5\nThis finding suggests the possibility of an early peak of infectiousness, with possible transmission of SARS-CoV-2 before the onset of symptoms. If confirmed, the presence of relevant presymptomatic transmission might hamper control efforts, including contact tracing and timely isolation of index cases, as well as passenger screening at airports. By contrast, strategies based on social distancing, such as limiting mass gatherings and contact in the workplace and in schools, might still be effective.15\n,  24\n,  25\n\nEvidence is accumulating to indicate the possibility of transmission during the incubation phase.25\n\n,  26\n,  27\n,  28\n,  29\n,  30\n,  31\nIt is worth noting also that our estimates of the incubation period and serial interval were based on analysis of cluster data, for which we assumed that the risk of infection from the community was negligible compared with that from infected individuals in the cluster. Although this assumption appears to be reasonable given the intensity of contact tracing, community transmission cannot be fully ruled out.The results presented thus far support a change in epidemiological characteristics of the COVID-19 outbreak over time and as the epidemic expanded to multiple locations. Many of the key epidemiological time-delay distributions are different from those reported in studies focusing on the early transmission dynamics of COVID-19 in Wuhan.5\nThis difference is probably the consequence of the increased awareness of the public and physicians, behavioural changes of the population with respect to respiratory disease symptoms, increased health-care readiness, and elevated alert and response across mainland China.We estimated that Rt followed different patterns across China. We found that the epidemic was self-sustained for short periods of time only (no more than 3 weeks) in provinces outside Hubei that reported a large number of cases,32\nand estimated that, since the end of January, 2020, Rt has been below the epidemic threshold in all studied provinces. This finding is consistent with the gradual decrease in the number of detected COVID-19 cases reported across China and suggests a beneficial effect of the strict public health intervention policies implemented in China. In particular, strict social-distancing measures were implemented in all the analysed Chinese provinces and included close community management (eg, case isolation and household quarantine of close contacts), suspension of public activities, traffic restrictions, and school closure. A full list and timeline of the implemented interventions in each of the analysed locations is reported in the appendix (26\u201330). It should be stressed that the effectiveness of containment measures only applies while they are in place, and a relaxation of public health interventions or a substantial change in human behaviour might lead to a subsequent increase in transmission. Furthermore, our findings are based on analysis of nine of the most affected provinces in mainland China outside Hubei. Therefore, although unlikely, it is possible that other provinces reporting only a few cases could still have self-sustained outbreaks. Finally, the contribution of asymptomatic and presymptomatic infections to COVID-19 transmission remains unclear, as does the amount of asymptomatic or presymptomatic transmission captured in existing datasets.28\n,  29\n,  30\n,  31\n,  33\n,  34This study is prone to the usual limitations pertaining to analysis of rapidly evolving infectious disease outbreaks, including biases due to case ascertainment, non-homogeneous sampling over time and by location, as well as hidden and unmodelled correlations. Thus, the uncertainty might be larger than estimated. Our estimates of Rt are most robust, when assuming that under-reporting and the frequency of asymptomatic or presymptomatic transmission remain constant. Our estimates, however, are sensitive to marked changes in reporting rates and in the proportion of SARS-CoV-2 infections that lead to clinically identifiable symptoms. Individual records were retrieved from different data sources and thus might be affected by geographical differences in sampling of cases with specific exposures (eg, imported or locally acquired infections) and available dates of symptom onset. However, we compared our data for Shenzhen city, Hunan province, and Shandong province with official line lists and found the datasets to be of similar quality. It should also be stressed that the case definition has been changed several times since the start of the epidemic, and in particular, it was broadened on Jan 27. Therefore, because potentially more cases were identified since this change in case definition, our estimate of Rt should be considered an upper bound (appendix pp 25, 26). This finding lends further support to our conclusion that Rt has been decreasing since the end of January.Despite these limitations, a real-time updated patient line list such as the one we have compiled is crucial to assess the epidemiology and transmission dynamics of an emerging pathogen, inform situational awareness, and optimise responses to the outbreak. Since Jan 20, 2020, the National Health Commission of China has incorporated COVID-19 as a notifiable disease.35\n\nThe Chinese Government has committed to timely disclosure of COVID-19 information, a decision highly praised by WHO.36\nAccordingly, the local health commissions and the official data sources, from which our individual data originate, were authorised to release real-time information about epidemiological investigations on COVID-19 cases. The data collected for this analysis represent a valuable source of information and highlight the importance of publicly available records.In conclusion, our study provides a detailed overview of the changing epidemiology and transmission dynamics of COVID-19 in mainland China outside Hubei province. Our findings suggest a slowing down of the COVID-19 outbreak in mainland China (outside Hubei province), indicating that the initial steps taken towards interruption of COVID-19 transmission might have been effective. However, the epidemic is not yet under control, and a large proportion of the population is still susceptible. The trajectory of the outbreak in China and beyond will depend on the effectiveness of control policies and human behaviour in the coming months.ContributorsMA and HY designed the experiments.

Outside the original epicentre of Hubei province, they found that the effective reproduction number dropped below the critical threshold of 1 by the end of January, 2020, for nine heavily affected Chinese provinces or cities. This finding suggests significant slowing of local transmission. Importantly, these reductions were achieved in a matter of weeks from the first signs of local transmission in most provinces. Although the true causal nature of these transmission reductions is not addressed in Zhang and colleagues' analyses, it is probably due to the strict government-imposed restrictions on movement of people and social gatherings, widespread symptom screening, testing and quarantine programmes, and the strong emphasis on personal behaviour change (eg, hand hygiene, mask use, and physical distancing) to reduce the risk of transmission. The authors also found, as others have shown,2\nthat the mean incubation period and serial interval were of similar length (5\u00b72 days [95% CI 1\u00b78\u201312\u00b74] and 5\u00b71 days [1\u00b73\u201311\u00b76], respectively), suggesting an important role of transmission before or soon after symptoms have developed. Although this study has a number of limitations, it illustrates the power of rapid openly available data for providing important insights to guide complex policy decisions in the coming months.The authors used detailed, publicly available line lists, epidemiological reports, and case and contact investigation results from across China. Although, in the past, China has been criticised for a lack of transparency related to epidemiological surveillance data, this rapid openness goes beyond what most countries are doing today.3\nRapid analyses, including computational modelling efforts, are vital to assist decision makers in these largely uncharted waters; however, these analyses are only as good as their data. Our daily understanding of the pandemic is primarily based on the number of confirmed cases reported (eg, WHO daily reports and online dashboards4\n), which can only be interpreted with an understanding of who is being tested (eg, only severe cases) and laboratory capacity. To correct the epidemic curves, data on testing capacity and test eligibility criteria over time across the globe are urgently needed. Furthermore, insights to the frequency of asymptomatic and mildly symptomatic infections from individuals tested for the virus or antibody responses, irrespective of symptoms, will greatly improve real-time assessments.5\u2022 View related content for this articleThe interventions implemented throughout China include complete lockdown of cities, active case surveillance, rapid investments in increased testing capacity, isolation of cases, treatment of severe cases, quarantine of cases and high-risk groups, and behavioural risk-reduction strategies, such as the compulsory use of masks in the general population. The trajectory of the epidemic curves in China alone suggest that these measures\u2014some of them extreme\u2014might have led to substantial reductions in transmission as of late March, 2020. China made difficult decisions with complex trade-offs between economic and social consequences and acute health effects on the basis of little historical data. These decisions pave the way for other countries to design responses to COVID-19 on the basis of their experiences. The encouraging results from Zhang and colleagues' study provide hope that rapid control might be possible, although with high economic and social costs. Countries across the world are making some of the same policy decisions, effectively halting their economies in the hopes of avoiding a massive death toll, but such lockdowns cannot go on forever. In the search for a new sustainable normal, countries and municipalities will inevitably adopt a range of approaches adapted to local specificities in the coming months. Through open documentation of these varying policy choices and timelines, and real-time assessments of their effects, we can and must generate evidence to minimise the acute and long-term consequences of this pandemic.We declare no competing interests.", "S1473-30992030229-2": "Background\nThe incidence of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Wuhan, China, has been estimated using imported case counts of international travellers, generally under the assumptions that all cases of the disease in travellers have been ascertained and that infection prevalence in travellers and residents is the same.

The idea was that surveillance for H1N1 influenza virus was not intense during the early days of the pandemic in Mexico, the source location, and that detection would be far more sensitive in travellers leaving Mexico, who would be screened when returning home as a means of preventing introductions of cases into destination locations.2\n,  3\nReports that health systems in Wuhan were overwhelmed, and that many cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) were not being counted, led to the use of outgoing traveller data to estimate the time-specific risk of COVID-19 in Wuhan.1\nThis estimate, in turn, has been used to estimate the cumulative incidence of infection by a specific date in Wuhan and, from there (typically assuming exponential growth and no appreciable depletion of susceptible people), the cumulative number of cases. Two important assumptions underlie this calculation. First, it assumes that detection of cases in the destination location has been 100% sensitive and specific, whether cases are detected at the airport (with symptoms) or later after arrival at their destination (incubating during travel). Second, it assumes that travellers have the same prevalence of infection as does the average resident of Wuhan, so the prevalence inferred in travellers can be directly applied in Wuhan. Here, we consider the extent to which these two assumptions are justified and the expected effects they will have on our understanding of the current outbreak of COVID-19.We have previously reported4\nvariability between locations in the world in the relation between the number of travellers from Wuhan to each international destination and the number of imported cases detected in that destination. On average, across locations presumed to have high surveillance capacity, an increase of 31 passengers per day in estimated travel volume from Wuhan to each destination was associated with one additional imported case reported over the period Jan 8, 2020, to Feb 4, 2020.4\nHowever variation was reported around this average. Among destinations with substantial travel volume, Singapore showed the highest ratio of detected imported cases to daily travel volume, a ratio of 1\u00b70 cumulative case count per 10\u00b73 daily travellers. Singapore is known for exceptionally sensitive detection of cases (eg, during the 2003 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome [SARS])5\nand has had very detailed case-reporting during the COVID-19 outbreak. Therefore, to test the first assumption, that case-detection has been 100% sensitive, we use Singapore as an example location with very strong case-detection capacity, and we estimate the capacities of other locations relative to Singapore.Research in context\nEvidence before this study\nWe searched Google Scholar and PubMed on Feb 12, 2020, with the terms (\u201cCOVID-19\u201d OR \u201cSARS-CoV 2\u201d OR \u201cSARS coronavirus 2\u201d) AND (\u201cWuhan\u201d OR \u201cHubei\u201d) AND \u201cincidence traveler\u201d. We searched for any type of article published in English between Dec 1, 2019, and Feb 12, 2020. Current work to estimate the incidence of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Wuhan uses cases detected outside of China. From this work, other estimates are derived, such as case-fatality rates and risk of exportation to locations without yet-detected cases. Assumptions are made that the detection capacity of cases in destination locations is 100% and that travellers from Wuhan have the same prevalence of infection as does the average resident of Wuhan.\nAdded value of this study\nWe tested both these assumptions and quantified the bias that they introduce. Using a Bayesian modelling approach with WHO case counts of imported cases, estimates of passenger volume from Wuhan to destination locations, and the Global Health Security index of epidemic surveillance strength, we have provided the first estimates of the global ability to detect imported cases of COVID-19. Importantly, we have also shown the variation of this ability between regions with different surveillance strength. Finally, we have provided the first mathematical model to estimate the infection prevalence of Wuhan visitors relative to residents as a function of key variables, such as the visit duration.\nImplications of all the available evidence\nOur study will allow better estimates to be produced of the global burden of COVID-19, in view of the large underdetection of cases. Our findings will support rapid deployment of outbreak surveillance and control capacities in regions at high risk of case importation paired with low surveillance capacity. Our research implies that existing estimates, which assume perfect detection of cases outside of China, should increase values for infection prevalence in the epicentre of the epidemic and reduce estimates of case-fatality based on our prevalence estimates.Evidence before this studyWe searched Google Scholar and PubMed on Feb 12, 2020, with the terms (\u201cCOVID-19\u201d OR \u201cSARS-CoV 2\u201d OR \u201cSARS coronavirus 2\u201d) AND (\u201cWuhan\u201d OR \u201cHubei\u201d) AND \u201cincidence traveler\u201d.

Our research implies that existing estimates, which assume perfect detection of cases outside of China, should increase values for infection prevalence in the epicentre of the epidemic and reduce estimates of case-fatality based on our prevalence estimates.To test the second assumption, that travellers and residents of Wuhan have the same prevalence of infection, we built a simple mathematical model of the point prevalence of infection in visitors relative to that in residents. This model allows us to study the expected discrepancy between visitor and resident prevalence for various scenarios, such as different durations of visits, growth rates of infection, or times to recovery.From 195 worldwide locations (reflecting mainly countries, without taking any position on territorial claims), we included 194, excluding the epicentre of mainland China. Data for imported cases aggregated by location were obtained from the WHO technical report (dated Feb 4, 2020);6\n\na case count of 0 was assumed for all locations not listed. We used case counts up to Feb 4, 2020, because after this date the number of imported cases dropped rapidly,6\n\nprobably because of the lockdown of Hubei province implemented from Jan 23, 2020.We defined imported cases as people with known travel history from China; 82% (124 of 152) had travel history from Hubei province and 18% (28 of 152) from unknown locations in China.7\nEstimates of daily air travel volume were obtained from Lai and colleagues7\nand are based on historical (February, 2018) data from the International Air Travel Association, including estimates for 27 locations that are most connected to Wuhan. These data capture the daily average number of passengers traveling via direct and indirect flight itineraries from Wuhan to destinations outside of China. For 167 locations not listed by Lai,7\nwe set the air travel volume to three passengers per day, which is half the minimum reported by Lai.7\nBecause the relative (rather than absolute) flight connectivity of Wuhan with different locations matters for our model, we assumed that this relative connectivity was only weakly affected by early timing of the Lunar New Year in 2020.Surveillance capacity was assessed using the Global Health Security Index, which is an assessment of health security across 195 locations agreeing to the International Health Regulations (IHR 2005). Specifically, we used the second category of the index, Early Detection and Reporting Epidemics of Potential International Concern published in 2019, henceforth referred to as simply the GHS2 index. We classified locations with GHS2 index above the 80th percentile as high surveillance locations, those with GHS2 index below the 20th percentile as low surveillance locations, and all others as locations with medium surveillance capacity. In view of Singapore's high rate of COVID-19 case-detection per expected case, we treated this location as a special case for surveillance of COVID-19 and we assigned it its own category of most strong surveillance.We did not need to obtain ethics approval for this study because we did not enrol individuals and we used data available publicly.We considered detection of 18 cases by Feb 4, 2020, in Singapore6\n\nto reflect the highest surveillance capacity among all locations, and we estimated the probability of detection in other locations relative to Singapore according to the following model. We modelled case-detection across i=\u20081, . . ., n worldwide locations, with 194 locations (n); Singapore was indexed i=\u20081, with the rest of the locations following in order of decreasing GHS2 index. Using the notation of McElreath,8\nwe assumed that the observed case count across n locations followed a Poisson distribution and that the expected case count was linearly proportional to daily air travel volume and a random variable \u03b8level[i] reflecting the ith location's capacity of detecting cases relative to Singapore.In this equation,Y\ni\n\u223cPoisson(\n\u03bb\ni\n),\u03bb\ni\n={\n\u03b2\nx\ni\nifi=1,\n\u03b2\nx\ni\n\u03b8\nlevel[i]\notherwiselevel[i]=\n\u23a7\n\u23a9\n\u23a8\n\u23aa\n\u23aa\nhighifi=2,...,65\nmediumifi=66,...,129,\nlowifi=130,...,149,\u03b8\nhigh\n,\n\u03b8\nmedium,\n\u03b8\nlow\n\u223cUniform(0,1)log(\u03b2)\u223cNormal(0,50),\u03b8\nglobal\n=\n1\n\u2211\nn\ni=2\nx\ni\n\u2211\nn\ni=2\nx\ni\n\u03b8\nlevel[i],Yi denotes the reported case count in the ith location, \u03bbi is the expected case count in the ith location, \u03b2 denotes the regression coefficient, xi is the daily air travel volume of the ith location, and \u03b8level[i] denotes the ith location's capacity of detecting cases relative to Singapore.For \u03b8high, \u03b8medium, and \u03b8low, we assigned a uniform prior over [0,1] and for log(\u03b2) we assigned a weakly informative normal prior with mean 0 and SD 50. We considered the global average detection probability \u03b8global to be a transformation of \u03b8level[i]. In practice, having fitted the model, we took the weighted mean of posterior draws of \u03b8level[i] for i\u2008=\u20082, . . ., n, where weights are proportional to daily air travel volume, xi. Exclusion of Singapore (i\u2008=\u20081) enabled estimation of the global detection probability relative to Singapore. Conversely, 1/\u03b8global was the multiplier of the case count that could have been detected globally under a capacity equivalent to that of Singapore.We calculated the mean and 95% highest posterior density interval (HPDI; the narrowest interval containing a given probability mass)8\nof the numerical approximation of the posterior distribution of \u03b8global, and the mean and 95% HPDI of the numerical approximation of the posterior distribution of 1/\u03b8global. Note that the estimate of 1/\u03b8global and its 95% HPDI is not simply the inverse of the estimate for \u03b8global and its bounds, because the inverse of a mean is not equal to the mean of the inverse, and similarly for the HPDIs.We fitted our model using Stan version 2.19.1,9\nand we drew 80\u2008000 samples from the joint posterior distribution of \u03b8high, \u03b8medium, \u03b8low and \u03b2 using four independent chains (20\u2008000 samples each), and discarded for each chain the first 500 samples (burn-in). Diagnostic plots of the Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampler for each of the inferred random variables (\u03b8high, \u03b8medium, \u03b8low and \u03b2) are shown in the appendix (p 2). All analyses are fully reproducible with the code available online.In 2009, during the influenza pandemic which originated in Mexico, most travellers leaving Mexico were assumed to be tourists, or other temporary visitors, with relatively short stays in Mexico, and the risk that they were infected was assumed to represent a cumulative hazard over the period of their stay.2\n,  3\nThe basic assumption was that short-term visitors faced the same hazard of infection as did residents of Mexico, but, in view of their shorter stay, visitors had a somewhat lower prevalence of infection when returning to their home location. Many estimates in 2019\u201320 for COVID-19 have, instead, made the assumption of equal prevalence in travellers leaving Wuhan and in residents, which is equivalent to assuming that either all travellers are Wuhan residents or (if travellers are a mix of residents and visitors) all visitors had stayed long enough during the epidemic that their prevalence was similar to that of residents.To quantify the difference between these two scenarios, assuming that all travellers are short-term visitors versus assuming that all travellers are residents or long-term visitors, we considered a simple model of an exponentially growing epidemic, in which the hazard of infection at time t is denoted \u03bb(t) and is increasing at rate r. At the beginning of the epidemic, which we call time 0, the hazard of infection is \u03bb(0) and thereafter \u03bb(t) =\u2008\u03bb(0)ert. Then the point prevalence of infection at time u in residents who have stayed in Wuhan for the duration of the epidemic will be the probability that they have become infected and not recovered by time u, assuming that the cumulative hazard remains small enough by that point that there has been no appreciable depletion of susceptible people.P\nres\n=\n\u222b\nu\n0\n\u03bb(x)\ne\n\u2212\u03b3(u\u2212x)\ndx,\n=\n\u222b\nu\n0\n\u03bb(0)\ne\nrx\ne\n\u2212\u03b3(u\u2212x)\ndx,\n=\n\u222b\nu\n0\n\u03bb(0)\ne\n\u2212\u03b3u\ne\n(r+y)x\ndx,\n=\n\u03bb(0)\ne\n\u2212\u03b3u\nr+y\n(\ne\n(r+y)x\n)\n\u2223\n\u2223\nu\n0\n,\n=\n\u03bb(0)\ne\n\u2212\u03b3u\nr+y\n(\ne\n(r+y)u\n\u22121).This equation assumes exponentially distributed time to recovery, with mean duration y\u22121, when we assume that the infection is only detectable until the time of recovery (for other cases, time to recovery should be duration of detectable infection). The same quantity for a visitor who had only been in Wuhan for d days before departure would be as follows:P\nvis\n=\n\u03bb(0)\ne\n\u2212\u03b3u\nr+y\n(\ne\n(r+y)u\n\u2212\ne\n(r+y)(u\u2212d)\n).In this equation, we assume that visitors differ from residents only in the duration of exposure, not in the intensity of exposure. Under these assumptions, the ratio of prevalence in visitors to that in residents, which we call V, would be as follows:V=\nP\nvis\nP\nres\n=\ne\n(r+y)u\n\u2212\ne\n(r+y)(u\u2212d)\ne\n(r+y)u\n\u22121Once u and, thus, the number of cases in the exponential phase of the epidemic is substantial, this term can be well approximated as V\u2008\u2248\u20081\u2013e\u2212(r\u2008+\u2008y)d. We plot this approximation of V since doubling times aligned with a range of times to recovery and a range of lengths of stay (appendix p 3). The expression for V can also be expressed in terms of the transmission rate by replacing r + \u03b3 by \u03b2 denoting the transmission rate. This step yields the expression V\u2008\u2248\u20081\u2008\u2013\u2008e\u2212\u03b2d. We also include an analysis of V under the relaxed assumption that the transmission rate for residents and visitors might be different (appendix p 1).The funders had no role in study design, data collection, data analysis, data interpretation, or writing of the report.

Equivalently, an estimated 2\u00b78 (95% HPDI 1\u00b75\u20134\u00b74) times the current number of imported and detected cases could have been detected if all locations had had the same detection capacity as Singapore, leading to 1\u00b78 (0\u00b75\u20133\u00b74) undetected cases per detected case. Globally, detection capacity varied widely: the ability to detect imported cases among, according to GHS2 index, locations with a high surveillance capacity was 40% (95% HPDI 22\u201367), among locations with medium surveillance capacity it was 37% (18\u201368), and among locations with low surveillance capacity it was 11% (0\u201342; figure 1).\nFigure 1Posterior distributions of detection probabilities relative to Singapore\nShow full caption\nView Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The prevalence ratio between Wuhan's temporary visitors and residents approached 1\u00b700 as the epidemic growth rate, the duration of stay, and the recovery rate increased, and it approached 0\u00b700 for short duration of stay, long time to recovery, and slower epidemic growth (figure 2). For example, for a visiting duration of 1 week (7 days), an epidemic doubling time of 5 days, and a time to recovery of 11 days, the prevalence in visitors is predicted to be 0\u00b780 (ie, 80% of that in residents). Instead, for a visiting duration of 3 days, the prevalence in visitors would be 0\u00b750 (50% of that in residents).\nFigure 2Ratio of infection prevalence in temporary visitors relative to that in residents\nShow full caption\nView Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)In our study, we tested two assumptions underlying the estimation of incidence at the epicentre of the COVID-19 outbreak. The first of these was that the capacity for detection of international imported cases is 100% sensitive and specific across locations. Although we know of no reason to doubt specificity of detection, we tested the assumption of 100% sensitivity. Based on findings of our previous study,4\nwe assumed Singapore has the highest capacity for surveillance with respect to COVID-19. We regressed cumulative cases against Wuhan-to-location air travel volume, considering Singapore to have the greatest detection capacity, and estimating relative underdetection compared with Singapore in remaining locations (classified according to the GHS2 index). Although it is unlikely that the GHS2 index reflects the true ranking of locations for any specific epidemic, we assume that it can capture roughly different levels of surveillance capacity. We, therefore, grouped locations (apart from Singapore) into three classes of surveillance capacity (high, medium, and low) instead of using exact ranking. Although possibly important for detection, our model does not account for differences in typical flight duration to different destinations.We estimated that detection of exported cases from Wuhan worldwide is 38% (95% HPDI 22\u201364) as sensitive as it has been in Singapore. Put another way, this estimate implies that the true number of cases in travellers is at least 2\u00b78 (95% HPDI 1\u00b75\u20134\u00b74) times the number that has been detected. Equivalently, for each detected exported case there are at least 1\u00b78 (95% HPDI 0\u00b75\u20133\u00b74) undetected cases. If the model is correct, this is a lower bound on the frequency of undetected cases for two reasons. First, Singapore's detection capacity is probably not 100% efficient. Singapore had, as of Feb 12, 2020, eight documented cases of COVID-19 transmission, for which there were no known epidemiological links to China or other known cases,10\n\nimplying that imported cases in Singapore could have gone undetected (although it is not certain that these imports came from Wuhan or elsewhere in China, and links might still be found). Second, Singapore's detection capacity, similar to that in other locations, has relied largely on symptoms and travel history, so the number of asymptomatic or low-severity cases missed by such a strategy is unknown.The second assumption we tested is that the true prevalence in visitors to the epicentre is similar to that of residents: it might be different for either of two reasons. First, the true prevalence could be less if people who visit are less well integrated into the social mixing that produces infection (eg, if they have stayed in specific parts of the city or in hotels), or it could be more if travellers are engaging more intensely in relevant social mixing (eg, through welcoming ceremonies). This aspect could, therefore, increase or decrease prevalence in visitors relative to residents (appendix p 3). In our study, we focused on quantifying a second difference, which is that some visitors will have been in the city only for a short time and, thus, have had less exposure to the infection than residents. We find this effect is most pronounced when the epidemic is growing slowly, when visitors have stayed only briefly, and when the duration of detectable infection is short. We found that for plausible parameters for COVID-19, prevalence in visitors staying only 3 days could be as little as half that of residents, but for longer stays of more than a week the visitor prevalence should be 80% or more that of residents (figure 2). Assuming the population of travellers out of Wuhan is a mix of visitors of various durations and residents, this finding suggests that underestimation of source population prevalence because of the presence of short-stay visitors could be appreciable but more modest than the effect of imperfect detection. For example, in combination with our estimates of underdetection, the total underestimation of cases in Wuhan from only studying visitors could be around 70% for 7-day visits, 5-day doubling time, and 11 days of detectable infection or, with a 3-day visit, as much as 81%. The infection exposure of visitors in high-risk venues (eg, aeroplanes or airport toilets) could be important, and additional variation in exposure between travellers of different international destinations due to, for example, different dominant types of reasons for travel (eg, group holidays vs business trips).Based on our model, the risk of undetected importation and subsequent circulation correlates with air travel connectivity. Indeed, at the time of writing (March 9, 2020), nine locations have reported more than 500 confirmed cases of COVID-19 (France, Germany, Iran, Italy, Japan, Singapore, South Korea, Spain, and the USA), suggesting local transmission. All locations (apart from Iran) are among the 27 most connected locations to Wuhan through air travel,7\nwhich supports the important role of undetected importation through air travellers (the probability of drawing uniformly at random eight or more highly connected locations to Wuhan under the null assumption that draws are independent of flight connection is <0\u00b7001). However, as new COVID-19 epicentres evolve, the role of air travel from China in the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is expected to decline. Finally, our model predicts that locations with high connectivity to Wuhan paired with a relatively low surveillance capacity (eg, India, Maldives, New Zealand, Pakistan, Russia, Sri Lanka, and United Arab Emirates) are probably underdetecting imported cases and potentially also self-sustained transmission.Our finding that imported cases detected among travellers probably under-represents the source population prevalence has two important implications for the public health response to COVID-19. First, this finding has implications for approaches to case burden and severity estimation that use cases in travellers to impute cases in Wuhan, which are then compared (for severity estimation) against deaths in Wuhan. If the true number of imported cases is underestimated, then there are more cases in Wuhan and a larger denominator, resulting in reduced estimates of severity compared with severity estimates assuming 100% detection in travellers.11\nFuture studies should account for our evolving understanding of detection capacity when estimating case numbers and severity in source population on the basis of traveller case numbers. Second, our model predicts the scenario in which the virus has been imported from Wuhan and remained partly undetected in nearly all locations. An important corollary of this possibility is that, despite large efforts to detect and stop the virus from entering new locations, many undetected imported cases can occur and cause hidden local transmission until a sizable number of cases accumulates, leading to international spread of COVID-19 beyond locations' detection and reporting capacities.ContributorsRN, PMDS, ART, and ML designed the study, did the analysis, and wrote the report.Declaration of interestsML has received consulting fees from Merck.

Findings of the Global Health Security (GHS) index1\n\nsuggest that only 19% of countries have the ability to quickly detect and report epidemics of potential international concern, fewer than 5% of countries can rapidly respond to and mitigate the spread of an epidemic, and no country is fully prepared for epidemics or pandemics. Experience with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) seems to have confirmed these findings.In The Lancet Infectious Diseases, Rene Niehus and colleagues2\nreport a modelling approach with which they assessed the relative capacity for detection of imported cases of COVID-19 globally, and the prevalence of this disease among international travellers, and used these data to estimate cases of COVID-19 in Wuhan, China, from where the epidemic was first reported.\u2022 View related content for this articleUsing Singapore as a reference (because of its perceived perfect case-detection), Niehus and colleagues estimated that the global capacity to detect imported cases of COVID-19 before Feb 4, 2020, was 38% (95% highest posterior density interval [HPDI] 22\u201364) of Singapore's capacity, and was, respectively, 40% (95% HPDI 22\u201367), 37% (18\u201368), and 11% (0\u201342) of Singapore's capacity among countries with a high, medium, and low surveillance capacity, according to the GHS index.2\nThis finding indicates that about 2\u00b78 (95% HPDI 1\u00b75\u20134\u00b74) times current reported imported cases should have been detected if all countries had Singapore's detection capabilities. The ratio of detected to undetected cases (1:1\u00b78, 95% HPDI 0\u00b75\u20133\u00b74) indicates that about 64% of imported cases have not been detected.Based on imported cases aggregated by location, air travel volume, and GHS index for detection and reporting, Niehus and colleagues inferred that total COVID-19 cases in Wuhan have been underestimated by 70% based on the relatively lower prevalence of visitors who stayed for 7 days in Wuhan and underdetection capacity, and by 81% for 3-day visitors. This percentage is probably the lower bound since detection capacity was estimated relative to that in Singapore, which was probably not 100% efficient.2\nThe relatively lower prevalence of COVID-19 among short-term visitors compared with residents of Wuhan has contributed to the underestimation.2\nHowever, Niehus and colleagues conclude that it is more acceptable than the effect of underdetection.Niehus and colleagues remind us to reflect on causes of the high early case-fatality rate in Wuhan, which has important implication for countries struggling with COVID-19 now.3\n,  4\n\nOne explanation is the strong virulence of the virus, which is presumed to have crossed the species barrier from animal to human.5\nHowever, several studies on the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 imply that origin of the virus is still unknown. The virus identified in Wuhan might not be the first generation.6\n,  7\nThe high case-fatality rate in Wuhan is probably because the detection ability of viral nucleic acid was insufficient in the early stages of the outbreak. Most patients with mild disease had no access to a medical diagnosis and were excluded from calculation of the case-fatality rate, which was primarily contributed to by patients with severe disease.8\nMakeshift hospitals began to be built on Feb 4, 2020, in Wuhan, for medical care of patients with mild disease, and subsequent detection and treatment of mild cases decreased the number of deaths (numerator) while increasing the total number of cases (denominator).9\n\nOutside Hubei province, a lower case-fatality rate of 0\u00b79% (121 of 13\u2008500) has been attributed to perfect detection.10\n\nPeople in China (outside Hubei province) who visited any place outside of their regular residential area received a test, whereas people with no symptoms would be home quarantined for 14 days, particularly those who had recently visited Hubei province, who would be strictly followed up through home visits and by telephone by community management staff.Mathematical models have been used to simulate scenarios and predict evolution of infectious diseases since the early 20th century.11\nModels are usually driven by a disease's intrinsic mechanism or fitted through sufficient data, but they are frequently expected to provide quick insights of, and predictive power on, a new pathogen in the early stages of an outbreak, which are seemingly contradictory expectations.2\n,  12\nIndeed, it is not clear whether early cases of COVID-19 were from infection by animal or human, and data are limited and unreliable. In this case, models fitted by early data probably produce results divorced from reality. Early modelling studies have proved overly optimistic about the situation in Wuhan.12\nThe closer to reality, the more resources a model requires. Modellers must compromise with reality most of the time.As data are shared, and computing performance improves (including artificial intelligence), we believe that the above contradictions will be alleviated. Mathematical modelling will have a greater role in supporting clinical diagnosis and optimising a combination of strategies. In view of substantial data accumulated for COVID-19, an essential next step is to estimate whether a second wave of COVID-19 will appear in China.View Large Image\nCopyright \u00a9 2020 Flickr - GoToVanZJ declares grants from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (91546203, 91846302).

Over the past 10 weeks, I and many others have been in the thick of explaining what we know about coronaviruses and other respiratory viruses, and extrapolating this knowledge to understand severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) to many health-care providers, organisations, media, and lay people. I have watched the rapid transmission of this virus across continents and around the globe. Based on the alarming rate of disease\u2014along with my experience with RNA respiratory viruses\u2014and what we are now observing in the USA and around the world, I have concluded that we must do what we do not want to do.We must take clear and compelling actions\u2014now\u2014that none of us want to take, and that many will reject. To be clear, none of us, me included, have a crystal ball; however, we do have the benefit of history, genetics, virology, and current epidemiology to guide us. We have seen rapid transmission of this virus, with concomitant high rates of severe disease and associated mortality, across many countries in real time. We understand more about viral reproductive number, generation time, incubation period, transmission modes, and the effect on health-care systems across multiple countries. The numbers of cases appear to be doubling roughly every 3\u20134 days in multiple countries. We do not have antivirals, vaccines, antibody-based therapeutics, or specific treatments. We can only offer supportive care\u2014after the fact. Therefore, our only reasonable option is to maximally decrease viral transmission by maximally decreasing the opportunity for face-to-face interaction.\u2022 View related content for this articleIn this regard, I believe that we as a global community should enter into a period of contextually appropriate suspension. The idea is to suspend all activities that are not absolutely essential and that involve face-to-face interactions and group gatherings. It is apparent from the kinetics of SARS-CoV-2 transmission, the rapidly growing number of cases, the increasing involvement of more and more countries and regions within those countries, and the surge of demand on an already maximum capacity and frequently overstressed medical system, that this lockdown is the safest course of action. Based on our current understanding of the virus, this will probably be necessary for a minimum of several months in order to best weather this storm. I believe this action is necessary for various reasons.First, we have an increasingly older age demographic across virtually all countries, as well as unprecedented rates of obesity, smoking, diabetes, and heart and lung disease, and an ever-growing population of people who are immunocompromised\u2014all comorbidities that lead to significantly higher risks of severe disease and death from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). In turn, these huge numbers of people who are more severely affected by this virus require ongoing and more complex care, overwhelming many times over the capacity of medical systems to care for them. In turn, this high demand sharply drives up mortality rates while vital supplies, specialists, intensive care unit (ICU) beds, ventilators, and medicines are depleted. We have seen the worse effect of this virus in societies with older age demographics such as Italy compared with South Korea, which has a higher proportion of young people.Second, tremendous numbers of people, from all over the world, travel throughout the globe. The UN World Tourism Organization estimates that well over 1\u00b75 billion people travel internationally each year\u2014more than 4 million people per day. This movement and the mixing of people act as powerful accelerant fuel for this pandemic.Third, these large numbers of people also allow for mixing of people of all ages and all medical conditions; in particular, the mixing of children and younger adults (who can be infected and might have few or no symptoms) and older adults, which further accelerates the opportunity for older adults, who suffer disproportionately, to become infected.How and why would such actions work?The most important manoeuvre is to immediately decrease the risk of further human-to-human viral transmission. The idea is to drive down the opportunity for an infected person to transmit the virus to another uninfected person, in essence forcibly reducing the reproductive number of the virus. To achieve this reduction requires the suspension of all non-essential gatherings that provide opportunity for spread of the virus, including suspending travel, enacting school closures, cancelling social, church, or sports-related gatherings, and working from home wherever possible. In short, staying home.Putting these measures into place provides the opportunity to dramatically curb the speed at which the virus infects others. By flattening the epidemic curve, fewer people become ill at once, which dramatically decreases the surge in demand for medical care. For example, consider a community with a hospital that has 250 beds. Such a hospital has a small number of doctors, nurses, and other medical care personnel, as well as the necessary supplies to care for those who are ill. Such a hospital may have five to ten ICU beds and a very small number of ventilators. If five people get severely ill each week, they can probably be managed, with low rates of mortality. If 20 or 50 or 100 people become severely ill each week, the hospital and medical care system will be overwhelmed and the corresponding mortality rate will dramatically rise.Decreasing viral transmission, and therefore infection rates, is likely to decrease viral mutational rates, and increases time for the possible development of antiviral, monoclonal, and polyclonal therapies as well as vaccine countermeasures.Decreasing and spreading out high rates of illness, which results in a significantly lower mortality rate among those who do become ill, allows for resupply of crucially needed items to care for the ill, including personal protective equipment for health-care providers.I recognise that many will reject such a call to action, often because of not wanting to be inconvenienced, other financial and political agendas, the resulting disruption, and not wanting to do what is inherently counter to our nature. It seems in the current situation that people either panic or they dismiss the risk. But neither complacency nor panic is wise. It is inevitable at this point that this pandemic will get much worse before it gets better. For this reason, the willingness to take whatever actions are necessary to weather this pandemic while protecting the health and welfare of the maximum number of people possible\u2014all while slowing down the explosive transmission and consequences of this virus\u2014is what we must do. Now.I declare no competing interests.", "S1473-30992030234-6": "In their model, David Baud and colleagues1\nexclude individuals who die within 14 days of testing positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. If an individual contracts symptoms on March 1, tests positive on March 10, and dies on March 11, they would not be included in the denominator for case fatality rate (CFR) on March 11. In addition, patients might test positive up to 13 days after recovery.2\nAs testing is expanded, an asymptomatic patient infected 1 week before testing positive on March 3 should, but will not, be included in calculations for March 16.For the stated purpose of the authors, it might be useful to also include everyone who was symptomatic for 14 days before the calculated date. Consider a CFR calculation for March 15. If an individual was symptomatic on March 1 and tested positive on March 10, they would not be included in the denominator, even though the patient probably contracted the disease before the 14-day lag time.\u2022 View related content for this articleMoreover, patients with mild symptoms might not undergo testing and so might not be included in the overall denominator. A further consideration is the delay between testing and receipt of results. Consequently, individuals might not test positive until after the suggested 14-day incubation period. With disease spread, indications for COVID-19 testing will expand, thereby increasing the denominator size. These factors might act as time-varying confounding variables in the authors' calculation of CFR.One other published lag-time calculation has included half the additional cumulative deaths in the numerator and time from illness to death as the lag-time (13 days).3\nFor example, if calculating the CFR for March 15, the denominator would be cumulative cases until March 2, and the numerator would be cumulative deaths until March 2, in addition to half of the deaths recorded from March 2\u201315. This method assumes a normal distribution of time from illness to death.Although underestimation of CFRs risks the population not taking the threat seriously, overestimation might lead to unnecessary additional panic and concern. During a rapidly evolving pandemic, accurate measures of disease characterisation are important. Future estimates will probably involve patient-specific data for refined calculation.

Precision, however, is as necessary in calculations as in semantics.According to the Dictionary of Epidemiology, the mortality rate is an \u201cestimate of the portion of a population that dies during a specified period\u201d.2\nIn the case of this outbreak, the mortality rate over a period of 1 year per 100\u2008000 Chinese citizens would be around 0\u00b723 (as of March 16, 2020). Therefore, precisely speaking, neither older estimates nor Baud and colleagues' new calculation can be referred to as the mortality rate.\u2022 View related content for this articleIn both trade press and newspapers, the case fatality rate (CFR) is often used to describe the situation pertaining to COVID-19, as well as to any other epidemic. The definition of the CFR in the Dictionary of Epidemiology states that it is \u201cthe proportion of cases of a specified condition that are fatal within a specified time\u201d.2\nOn the one hand, as accurately pointed out by Baud and colleagues, the CFR might be underestimated because of a type of time-lag bias associated with diagnosing and reporting cases. Furthermore, calculations are based on the questionable assumption that all cases are being tested. On the other hand, as Pueyo suggests,3\nthe CFR might be overestimated due to the definition of a case. During an epidemic, cases might be defined either as total cases (ie, every confirmed case) or as closed cases (ie, only those who have recovered or died). Hence, the denominator for the CFR might be either of these numbers. In the initial phase of the epidemic, the number of closed cases is relatively small, and so the CFR calculated per closed cases is an overestimate. By contrast, when the CFR is calculated per total cases, the numerator is underestimated, and thus the whole calculation becomes an underestimate.Baud and colleagues' calculation, although interesting, is biased as well. As shown in the figure, it vastly overestimates the fatality of COVID-19 if one uses data from the initial phase of the outbreak. This overestimation is obviously due to undertesting and a time-lag bias, which is more pronounced in the beginning of an outbreak. As demonstrated in the figure, irrespective of the method used, all calculations are biased, especially in the initial part of an outbreak, and converge once all cases are closed. Nevertheless, it seems that the CFR calculated per total cases is the least affected by reporting biases.\nFigureComparison of CFR calculation methods based on data from China for the period of Jan 22\u2013March 17, 2020\nShow full caption\nView Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)As of March 16, the CFR per total cases in China is 4\u00b700%, per closed cases is 4\u00b744%, and as calculated with Baud and colleagues' method is 4\u00b703%. However, despite the downturn of the outbreak in China, 8043 cases are still open, of which 2622 are serious or critical. According to Wu and McGoogan's estimates based on 72\u2008314 cases from Wuhan,4\n81% of patients are classified as mild, 14% as severe, and 5% as critical. CFRs in these subgroups are 0%, 0%, and 49%, respectively. Based on these estimates, of 8043 open cases in China, about 377 are in a critical condition and of those 184 will die. Therefore, once all active cases are closed, we might expect the CFR in China to be around 3\u00b785%.On a technical note, Baud and colleagues' calculation seems to be an attempt at reporting the cumulative death rate, which is defined as \u201cthe proportion of a group that dies over a specified time\u201d, rather than the mortality rate.2In summary, the CFR calculated per total cases seems to remain the best tool to express the fatality of the disease, even though it might underestimate this figure in the initial phase of an outbreak.All calculations were based on data acquired from worldometer.info/coronavirus and are available in the appendix. We declare no competing interests.", "S1473-30992030255-3": "We thank David Dongkyung Kim and Akash Goel,1\nPiotr Spychalski and colleagues,2\nand Marc Lipsitch3\nfor their critical reading of our Correspondence.4\nIn response to the points raised regarding our statistical methods, we agree that our model might not be appropriate for the early epidemic period because of the rapid increase in the number of cases in the 14 days preceding reported deaths. During this period, many patients were certainly diagnosed with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) at the time they developed critical illness or even at the time of death. By contrast, asymptomatic patients and those with mild disease remained untested. These two factors probably explain the overestimates of mortality at the beginning of the curve (Feb 12\u201324 in our model,4\nas exemplified in the appendix).As mentioned by Spychalski and colleagues, \u201cirrespective of the method used, all calculations are biased, especially in the initial part of an outbreak, and converge once all cases are closed\u201d. During and after the epidemic peak, patient denominators correspond to the best estimates of people presenting with clinical COVID-19 because of access to diagnostic testing and stabilisation of the number of new daily cases. At that time, we consider that patients were screened close to symptom onset. According to reports from WHO,5\n\nthe time from symptom onset to death ranges from 2 to 8 weeks. In our estimates, we chose to use the minimum time between symptom onset and death so not to overestimate mortality rates. Another factor that is still unknown and could bias the model is the number of asymptomatic cases, as acknowledged in our Correspondence. Most asymptomatic patients are not captured by screening, leading to underestimates in the denominator. We presented our model as a mortality rate estimate among people presenting with clinical COVID-19\u2014that is, symptomatic cases. In our experience, patients are mostly interested in knowing mortality rates when symptomatic, and less so of asymptomatic carriers.\u2022 View related content for this articleThere are other limitations that would apply to any statistical method, such as the possible change in testing frequency due to a shortage of tests. In some places, patients might even die before being tested. In the extreme, the mortality rate would reach 100% if only patients who had died were tested, whereas mortality rates would significantly drop if the entire population was to be tested. Thus, ideally, estimates should be adjusted according to test availability. Another consideration is that mortality in this epidemic is highly age-dependent, and so will vary according to the number of older individuals in the population. In high-income countries, the demographic pyramid is such that there are higher proportions of older individuals in the population. With larger numbers of vulnerable individuals exposed, one will observe higher overall mortality rates. In addition, mortality will vary across communities depending on access to tertiary medical centres and well equipped critical care units.For the time being, in Europe, we are still in the early epidemic period, with a rapid increase in the number of cases; additional data are needed for the assessment of cumulative mortality rates due to confirmed COVID-19 cases over time.6\n\nThus, the goal of our publication was to share our vision of the potential impact of COVID-19 using a model that integrated the viral incubation period and the time to death following diagnosis. As with every model, estimates will improve as the number of cases increase.We declare no competing interests.", "S1473-30992030257-7": "A case fatality ratio of an infectious disease measures the proportion of all individuals diagnosed with a disease who will die from that disease. For an emerging infectious disease, this ratio is thus a very important indicator not only of disease severity but also of its significance as a public health problem. For instance, WHO estimated a case fatality ratio of approximately 14\u201315% for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003,1\n\nand approximately 35% for Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) in 2012.2The ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by a virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), belonging to a large family of coronaviruses that also includes SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and MERS coronavirus (MERS-CoV). COVID-19 was first reported in December, 2019, in Wuhan, in the Hubei province of China, and spread very rapidly to all other prefectures in Hubei, as well as all other provinces, autonomous regions, municipalities, and special administrative regions of China, and more than 180 other countries and territories. As of March 21, 2020, there have been 292\u2008142 confirmed cases of COVID-19 worldwide, with 12\u2008784 deaths reported.3\u2022 View related content for this articleEstimating the case fatality ratio for COVID-19 in real time during its epidemic is very challenging. Nevertheless, this ratio is a very important piece of data that will help to guide the response from various government and public health authorities worldwide. The disease has brought tremendous pressure and disastrous consequences for the public health and medical systems in Wuhan, as well as in Iran, Italy, and in other countries. However, current estimates of case fatality ratio for COVID-19 vary depending on the datasets and time periods examined. A study of nearly 1100 patients from China suggested a case fatality ratio of 1\u00b74%.4\nFrom a dataset of 44\u2008672 confirmed cases in China, a report from the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)5\n\nestimated an overall case fatality ratio of 2\u00b73%, and pointed out that the ratio varied by location and intensity of transmission (eg, 2\u00b79% in Hubei vs 0\u00b74% in other areas of China), in different phases of the outbreak (eg, 14\u00b74% before Dec 31, 15\u00b76% for Jan 1\u201310, 5\u00b77% for Jan 11\u201320, 1\u00b79% Jan for 21\u201331, and 0\u00b78% after Feb 1), as well as by sex (2\u00b78% for males vs 1\u00b77% for females). Moreover, the Chinese CDC reported that the case fatality ratio increases with age (from 0\u00b72% for people aged 11\u201319 years, to 14\u00b78% for people aged \u226580 years), and with the presence of comorbid conditions (10\u00b75% for cardiovascular disease, 7\u00b73% for diabetes, 6\u00b70% for hypertension, 6\u00b73% for chronic respiratory disease, and 5\u00b76% for cancer). The WHO\u2013China Joint Mission on COVID-19 provided similar data and reported a case fatality ratio of 3\u00b78%, based on the 55\u2008924 laboratory-confirmed cases in China.6In The Lancet Infectious Diseases, Robert Verity and colleagues7\nprovide an estimate of the case fatality ratio for COVID-19. The authors argue that crude case fatality ratios obtained by simply dividing the number of deaths by the number of cases can be misleading because there can be a period of 2\u20133 weeks between a person developing symptoms and that case being detected and reported, and because surveillance of a novel virus is biased towards detecting severe cases, especially at the beginning of an outbreak when test capacity is low. By using individual-case data from mainland China (3665 cases) and 1334 cases detected outside of mainland China, assuming a constant attack rate by age, and adjusting for demography and age-based and location-based under-ascertainment, Verity and colleagues estimate the mean duration from symptom onset to death to be 17\u00b78 days (95% credible interval [CrI] 16\u00b79\u201319\u00b72) and from onset-of-symptoms to hospital discharge to be 24\u00b77 days (22\u00b79\u201328\u00b71). The study findings give an estimate of the overall case fatality ratio in China of 1\u00b738% (95% CrI 1\u00b723\u20131\u00b753), which becomes higher as age increases (figure).\nFigureComparison of case fatality ratios for SARS,1\n\n,  8\nCOVID-19,7\nand seasonal influenza9\n\nShow full caption\nView Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Estimates of case fatality ratios might vary slightly from country to country because of differences in prevention, control, and mitigation policies implemented, and because the case fatality ratio is substantially affected by the preparedness and availability of health care. Early studies5\n\n,  6\n\nhave shown that delaying the detection of infected cases not only increases the probability of spreading the virus to others (most likely family members, colleagues, and friends) but also makes the infection worse in some cases, thereby increasing the case fatality ratio.7Comparisons of case fatality ratios for SARS, COVID-19, and seasonal influenza in different age groups are shown in the figure. Even though the fatality rate is low for younger people, it is very clear that any suggestion of COVID-19 being just like influenza is false: even for those aged 20\u201329 years, once infected with SARS-CoV-2, the case fatality ratio is around three times higher than that of seasonal influenza in people aged 18\u201349 years. For people aged 60 years and older, the chance of survival following SARS-CoV-2 infection is approximately 95% in the absence of comorbid conditions. However, the chance of survival will be considerably decreased if the patient has underlying health conditions, and continues to decrease with age beyond 60 years.5\n\n,  6Although China seems to be out of the woods now, many other countries are facing tremendous pressure from the COVID-19 pandemic. The strategies of early detection, early diagnosis, early isolation, and early treatment that were practised in China6\n\nare likely to be not only useful in controlling the outbreak, but also contribute to decreasing the case fatality ratio of the disease.View Large Image\nCopyright \u00a9 2020 Hospital ClinicThis online publication has been corrected.

However, on Feb 26, 2020, the rate of increase in cases became greater in the rest of the world than inside China. Substantial outbreaks are occurring in Italy (69 176 cases), the USA (51\u2008914 cases), and Iran (24 811 cases), and geographical expansion of the epidemic continues.Clinical studies of hospitalised patients have shown that, at onset of COVID-19, patients frequently show symptoms associated with viral pneumonia, most commonly fever, cough, sore throat, myalgia, and fatigue.2\n,  3\n,  4\n,  5\n,  6\nThe case definition adopted in China and elsewhere includes further stratification of cases as severe (defined as tachypnoea [\u226530 breaths per min], oxygen saturation \u226493% at rest, or PaO2/FiO2 ratio <300 mm Hg) and critical (respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation, septic shock, or other organ dysfunction or failure that requires intensive care).7\n\nAccording to the report from the WHO\u2013China Joint Mission on COVID-19, 80% of the 55\u2008924 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 in China to Feb 20, 2020, had mild-to-moderate disease, including both non-pneumonia and pneumonia cases, while 13\u00b78% developed severe disease and 6\u00b71% developed to a critical stage requiring intensive care.8\n\nIn a study of clinical progression in 1099 patients,4\nthose at highest risk for severe disease and death included people over the age of 60 years and those with underlying conditions, including hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, chronic respiratory disease, and cancer.Research in context\nEvidence before this study\nWe searched PubMed, medRxiv, bioRxiv, arXiv, SSRN, Research Square, Virological, and Wellcome Open Research for peer-reviewed articles, preprints, and research reports on the severity of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), using the search terms \u201ccoronavirus\u201d, \u201c2019-nCoV\u201d, and similar terms, and \u201cfatality\u201d, up to March 6, 2020. Several studies have estimated the case fatality ratio (the percentage of individuals with symptomatic or confirmed disease who die from the disease) and infection fatality ratio (the percentage of all infected individuals who die from the disease, including those with mild disease) of COVID-19 using a range of different statistical and modelling methods. Studies done solely in hospitalised patients report the highest fatality ratios (8\u201328%), representing the outcome for the most severely ill patients. Estimates of the population-level case fatality ratio from all case reports are in the range of 2\u20138%. Estimates of the infection fatality ratio averaged across all age-groups range from 0\u00b72% to 1\u00b76%, while estimates of the infection fatality ratio in the oldest age group (\u226580 years) range from 8% to 36%. None of the identified studies had adjusted for differences in the denominator populations to obtain estimates that could be applied across populations. No other studies have estimated the proportion of infected individuals who will require hospitalisation.\nAdded value of this study\nBy synthesising data from across a range of surveillance settings, we obtained estimates of the age-stratified case fatality ratio and infection fatality ratio that take into account the different denominator populations in the datasets. Our underlying assumption, that attack rates (ie, the probability of becoming infected) do not vary substantially by age, is consistent with previous studies for respiratory infections. Under this assumption, differences in age patterns among cases in Wuhan versus those elsewhere in China would probably due to under-ascertainment of cases, given the different surveillance systems in place. Our results are consistent with this hypothesis, with cases in Wuhan seen in older individuals, who would have been identified through attendance at hospital, whereas cases elsewhere in China being younger overall, which would be explained by the policy of testing those with a travel history to Wuhan. After correcting for these biases, we found that estimates of the case fatality ratio from China are consistent with those obtained from early international cases. Our age-stratified estimates of the infection fatality ratio can be applied to any demography to give an estimate of the infection fatality ratio in older and younger populations. These estimates can be combined with estimates of the infection attack rate (approximately 80% for an unmitigated epidemic) to give rough projections of scale. Similarly, our estimates of the proportion of infections requiring hospitalisation can be combined with the infection attack rate to forecast health-care requirements.\nImplications of all the available evidence\nOur estimates of the case fatality ratio for COVID-19, although lower than some of the crude estimates made to date, are substantially higher than for recent influenza pandemics (eg, H1N1 influenza in 2009). With the rapid geographical spread observed to date, COVID-19 therefore represents a major global health threat in the coming weeks and months. Our estimate of the proportion of infected individuals requiring hospitalisation, when combined with likely infection attack rates (around 50\u201380%), show that even the most advanced health-care systems are likely to be overwhelmed.

However, crude case fatality ratios obtained by dividing the number of deaths by the number of cases can be misleading.9\n,  10\nFirst, there can be a period of 2\u20133 weeks between a person developing symptoms, the case subsequently being detected and reported, and observation of the final clinical outcome. During a growing epidemic, the final clinical outcome of most of the reported cases is typically unknown. Simply dividing the cumulative reported number of deaths by the cumulative number of reported cases will therefore underestimate the true case fatality ratio early in an epidemic.9\n,  10\n,  11\nThis effect was observed in past epidemics of respiratory pathogens, including severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)12\nand H1N19\ninfluenza, and as such is widely recognised. Thus, many of the estimates of the case fatality ratio that have been obtained to date for COVID-19 correct for this effect.13\n,  14\n,  15\n,  16\nAdditionally, however, during the exponential growth phase of an epidemic, the observed time lags between the onset of symptoms and outcome (recovery or death) are censored, and naive estimates of the observed times from symptom onset to outcome provide biased estimates of the actual distributions. Ignoring this effect tends to bias the estimated case fatality ratio downwards during the early growth phase of an epidemic.Second, surveillance of a newly emerged pathogen is typically biased towards detecting clinically severe cases, especially at the start of an epidemic when diagnostic capacity is low (figure 1). Estimates of the case fatality ratio can thus be biased upwards until the extent of clinically milder disease is determined.9\nData from the epicentre of the outbreak in Wuhan have primarily been obtained through hospital surveillance and, thus, are likely to represent patients with moderate or severe illness, with atypical pneumonia or acute respiratory distress being used to define suspected cases eligible for testing.7\n\nIn these individuals, clinical outcomes are likely to be more severe, so any estimates of the case fatality ratio will be higher. Elsewhere in mainland China and the rest of the world, countries and administrative regions alert to the risk of infection being imported via travel initially instituted surveillance for COVID-19 with a broader set of clinical criteria for defining a suspected case. These criteria typically included a combination of symptoms (eg, cough and fever) combined with recent travel history to the affected region (Wuhan, or Hubei province)2\n,  17\n. Such surveillance is likely to detect clinically mild cases but, by initially restricting testing to those with a travel history or link, might have missed other symptomatic cases.\nFigure 1Spectrum of COVID-19 cases\nShow full caption\nView Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Here we attempt to adjust for these biases in data sources to obtain estimates of the case fatality ratio (proportion of all cases that will eventually lead to death) and infection fatality ratio (the proportion of all infections that will eventually lead to death) using both individual-level case report data and aggregate case and death counts from mainland China, from Hong Kong and Macau, and international case reports. By adjusting for both underlying demography and potential under-ascertainment at different levels of the severity pyramid (figure 1), these estimates should be broadly applicable across a range of settings to inform health planning while more detailed case data accrue.We identified information on the characteristics of 48 patients who died from COVID-19 in Hubei, reported by the National Health Commission and the Hubei Province Health Commission website up to Feb 8, 2020. We recorded the following data elements, where available: sex, age, date of symptom onset, date of hospitalisation, and date of death. Of the 48 cases, neither the date of symptom onset nor the date of report was available for 13 cases. We also removed eight cases with onset before Jan 1, 2020, or death before Jan 21, 2020, and three deaths after Jan 28, 2020, which were the dates consistent with reliable reporting of onset and death in this setting, respectively, considering the onset-to-death times (including early onsets creates a bias towards long onset-to-death times, reflecting under-ascertainment of deaths early on). This left 24 deaths, which we used to estimate the onset-to-death distribution.We collated data on 2010 cases reported in 37 countries and two special administrative regions of China (Hong Kong and Macau), from government or ministry of health websites and media reports, until Feb 25, 2020. We recorded the following information where available: country or administrative region in which the case was detected, whether the infection was acquired in China or abroad, date of travel, date of symptom onset, date of hospitalisation, date of confirmation, date of recovery, and date of death. We used data from 165 recovered individuals with reported recovery dates and reported or imputed onset dates to estimate the onset-to-recovery distribution, after excluding 26 recoveries without appropriate information on dates of recovery, report, or locality. We used data on 1334 international cases to obtain estimates of the case fatality ratio, not including cases without dates of report.Data on 70\u2008117 PCR-confirmed and clinically diagnosed cases by date of onset in Wuhan and elsewhere in China from Jan 1 to Feb 11, 2020, were extracted from the WHO\u2013China Joint Mission report.8\n\nOver this period a total of 1023 deaths were reported across China, with these data available disaggregated into 10-year age bands between 0\u20139 years and 70\u201379 years old, and a further age band for those aged 80 years or older.7\n\nUsing collated data on daily reported deaths obtained each day from the National Health Commission regional websites, we estimated that 74% of deaths occurred in Wuhan and the remainder outside Wuhan. Additionally, the most recent available cumulative estimates (March 3, 2020) of 80\u2008304 confirmed cases and 2946 deaths within China were extracted from the WHO COVID-19 Situation Report (number 43).1An earlier (now withdrawn) preprint of a subset of these cases up to Jan 26, 2020 reported the age distribution of cases categorised by severity for 3665 cases.18\nUnder the China case definition, a severe case is defined as tachypnoea (\u226530 breaths per min) or oxygen saturation 93% or higher at rest, or PaO2/FiO2 ratio less than 300 mm Hg.7\n\nAssuming severe cases to require hospitalisation (as opposed to all of the patients who were hospitalised in China, some of whom will have been hospitalised to reduce onward transmission), we used the proportion of severe cases by age in these patients to estimate the proportion of cases and infections requiring hospitalisation.Data on infection prevalence in repatriated expatriates returning to their home countries were obtained from government or ministry of health websites and media reports. To match to the incidence reported in Wuhan on Jan 30, 2020, we used data from six flights that departed between Jan 30 and Feb 1, 2020, inclusive.In early February 2020 a cruise liner named the Diamond Princess was quarantined after a disembarked passenger tested positive for the virus. Subsequently all 3711 passengers on board were tested over the next month. We extracted data on the ages of passengers onboard on Feb 5, 2020, the dates of positive test reports, which were available for 657 out of 712 PCR-confirmed cases, and the dates of ten deaths among these cases from the reports of the Japan Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare19\n\nand international media.Age-stratified population data for 2018 were obtained from the National Bureau of Statistics of China.20\n\nAccording to these data, the population of Wuhan in 2018 was approximately 11 million people.All analyses were done with R software (version 3.6.2), with Bayesian Marko-Chain Monte Carlo via the package drjacoby (version 1.0.0).21\nData and code are available online at GitHub.In estimating time intervals between symptom onset and outcome, it was necessary to account for the fact that, during a growing epidemic, a higher proportion of the cases will have been infected recently (appendix p 7). Therefore, we re-parameterised a gamma model to account for exponential growth using a growth rate of 0\u00b714 per day, obtained from the early case onset data (appendix p 6). Using Bayesian methods, we fitted gamma distributions to the data on time from onset to death and onset to recovery, conditional on having observed the final outcome. Missing onset dates were imputed on the basis of dates of report, where available.Estimates of the distribution of times from onset-to-death were used to project the expected cumulative number of deaths given the onsets observed in Wuhan and outside Wuhan, assuming a uniform attack rate across age groups. Using the age-distribution of the population, we obtained an estimate of the expected number of infections in each age group. Under-ascertainment was estimated in and outside of Wuhan by comparing the number of observed cases by age to this expected distribution, assuming perfect ascertainment in the 50\u201359 age group as this group had the highest number of detected cases relative to population size. We also did a sensitivity analysis assuming a differential attack rate by age (appendix p 9). For Wuhan, we added scaling to account for further under-ascertainment compared with outside of Wuhan. These steps gave us the expected age-distribution of cases.For a given onset-to-death distribution, we obtained a modelled estimate of the cumulative number of deaths by age under an age-dependent case fatality ratio (fitted relative to the case fatality ratio in the oldest age group, which represented the highest crude case fatality ratio). This estimate was compared with the observed deaths by age using a Poisson likelihood. These data were then jointly fitted alongside the most recent age-aggregated cumulative deaths and cases in mainland China. Given that the numbers of observed cases and deaths have dropped substantially following a peak in late January, the ratio of current cumulative cases to current number of deaths, once corrected for under-ascertainment, should provide a good estimate of the final case fatality ratio.11To estimate the infection fatality ratio we fitted to data on infection prevalence from international Wuhan residents who were repatriated to their home countries. Our age-stratified case fatality ratio and infection fatality ratio model was jointly fitted to the case data and infection prevalence data with use of Bayesian methods, using our previous estimate of the onset-to-death distribution as a prior. Full mathematical details are provided in the appendix (p 8).Assuming a uniform attack rate by age groups, we used the demography-adjusted under-ascertainment rates calculated above to obtain an estimate of the proportion of infected individuals who would require hospitalisation.To independently validate our infection fatality ratio estimate, we analysed data from the outbreak on the Diamond Princess cruise liner taking the dates of reported positive tests as a proxy for onset date. We calculated the expected proportion of deaths observed until March 25, 2020, given the onset times and estimated onset-to-death distribution (appendix p 13).We used parametric and non-parametric methods11\n,  22\nto estimate the case fatality ratio in cases reported outside of mainland China using individual-level data. Cases in which the outcome was unknown were treated as censored observations. For parametric and non-parametric analyses, missing onset dates were multiply imputed using information on the onset-to-report distribution, and unreported recoveries were imputed using onset-to-outcome distributions and country summary data. The parametric models were fitted to the data using Bayesian methods (appendix p 12).The funder of the study had no role in study design, data collection, data analysis, data interpretation, or writing of the report. The corresponding author had full access to all the data in the study and had final responsibility for the decision to submit for publication.In the subset of 24 deaths from COVID-19 that occurred in mainland China early in the epidemic, with correction for bias introduced by the growth of the epidemic, we estimated the mean time from onset to death to be 18\u00b78 days (95% credible interval [CrI] 15\u00b77\u201349\u00b77; figure 2) with a coefficient of variation of 0\u00b745 (95% CrI 0\u00b729\u20130\u00b754). With the small number of observations in these data and given that they were from early in the epidemic, we could not rule out many deaths occurring with longer times from onset to death, hence the high upper limit of the credible interval. However, given that the epidemic in China has since declined, our posterior estimate of the mean time from onset to death, informed by the analysis of aggregated data from China, is more precise (mean 17\u00b78 days [16\u00b79\u201319\u00b72]; figure 2).\nFigure 2Onset-to-death and onset-to-recovery distributions\nShow full caption\nView Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Using data on the outcomes of 169 cases reported outside of mainland China, we estimated a mean onset-to-recovery time of 24\u00b77 days (95% CrI 22\u00b79\u201328\u00b71) and coefficient of variation of 0\u00b735 (0\u00b731\u20130\u00b739; figure 2). Both these onset-to-outcome estimates are consistent with a separate study in China.23Case fatality ratios were estimated from aggregate data on cases and deaths in mainland China (table 1). A large proportion of the cases, including all of those early in the epidemic, were reported in Wuhan, where the local health system was quickly overwhelmed. As a result, the age distribution of cases reported in Wuhan differed to that in the rest of China (figure 3A). Reported cases in Wuhan were more frequent in older age groups, perhaps reflecting higher severity (and therefore prioritisation for hospitalisation in Wuhan), while cases outside of Wuhan might also show a bias in terms of the relationship between age and travel. Adjusting for differences in underlying demography and assuming no overall difference in the attack rate by age, we estimated high under-ascertainment of cases in younger age groups both inside and outside of Wuhan (figure 3C, D). Furthermore, we estimated a higher level of under-ascertainment overall in Wuhan compared with outside of Wuhan (figure 3C). Accounting for this under-ascertainment, we estimated the highest case fatality ratio (13\u00b74% [11\u00b72\u201315\u00b79%]) in the 80 years and older age group (figure 3B, table 1), with lower case fatality ratios associated with lower age groups, and the lowest in the 0\u20139 years age group (0\u00b700260% [0\u00b7000312\u20130\u00b70382]).\nTable 1Estimates of case fatality ratio and infection fatality ratio obtained from aggregate time series of cases in mainland China\nDeaths Laboratory-confirmed cases*\nCase fatality ratio Infection fatality ratio\u2020\nCrude Adjusted for censoring Adjusted for censoring, demography, and under-ascertainment\u2021\nOverall 1023 44\u2008672 2\u00b729% (2\u00b715\u20132\u00b743) 3\u00b767% (3\u00b756\u20133\u00b780) 1\u00b738% (1\u00b723\u20131\u00b753) 0\u00b7657% (0\u00b7389\u20131\u00b733)\nAge group, years\n0\u20139 0 416 0\u00b7000% (0\u00b7000\u20130\u00b7883) 0\u00b70954% (0\u00b70110\u20131\u00b734) 0\u00b700260% (0\u00b7000312\u20130\u00b70382) 0\u00b700161% (0\u00b7000185\u20130\u00b70249)\n10\u201319 1 549 0\u00b7182% (0\u00b700461\u20131\u00b701) 0\u00b7352% (0\u00b70663\u20131\u00b774) 0\u00b70148% (0\u00b700288\u20130\u00b70759) 0\u00b700695% (0\u00b700149\u20130\u00b70502)\n20\u201329 7 3619 0\u00b7193% (0\u00b70778\u20130\u00b7398) 0\u00b7296% (0\u00b7158\u20130\u00b7662) 0\u00b70600% (0\u00b70317\u20130\u00b7132) 0\u00b70309% (0\u00b70138\u20130\u00b70923)\n30\u201339 18 7600 0\u00b7237% (0\u00b7140\u20130\u00b7374) 0\u00b7348% (0\u00b7241\u20130\u00b7577) 0\u00b7146% (0\u00b7103\u20130\u00b7255) 0\u00b70844% (0\u00b70408\u20130\u00b7185)\n40\u201349 38 8571 0\u00b7443% (0\u00b7314\u20130\u00b7608) 0\u00b7711% (0\u00b7521\u20130\u00b7966) 0\u00b7295% (0\u00b7221\u20130\u00b7422) 0\u00b7161% (0\u00b70764\u20130\u00b7323)\n50\u201359 130 10\u2008008 1\u00b730% (1\u00b709\u20131\u00b754) 2\u00b706% (1\u00b774\u20132\u00b743) 1\u00b725% (1\u00b703\u20131\u00b755) 0\u00b7595% (0\u00b7344\u20131\u00b728)\n60\u201369 309 8583 3\u00b760% (3\u00b722\u20134\u00b702) 5\u00b779% (5\u00b720\u20136\u00b734) 3\u00b799% (3\u00b741\u20134\u00b755) 1\u00b793% (1\u00b711\u20133\u00b789)\n70\u201379 312 3918 7\u00b796% (7\u00b713\u20138\u00b786) 12\u00b77% (11\u00b75\u201313\u00b79) 8\u00b761% (7\u00b748\u20139\u00b799) 4\u00b728% (2\u00b745\u20138\u00b744)\n\u226580 208 1408 14\u00b78% (13\u00b70\u201316\u00b77) 23\u00b73% (20\u00b73\u201326\u00b77) 13\u00b74% (11\u00b72\u201315\u00b79) 7\u00b780% (3\u00b780\u201313\u00b73)\nAge category (binary), years\n<60 194 30\u2008763 0\u00b7631% (0\u00b7545\u20130\u00b7726) 1\u00b701% (0\u00b7900\u20131\u00b717) 0\u00b7318% (0\u00b7274\u20130\u00b7378) 0\u00b7145% (0\u00b70883\u20130\u00b7317)\n\u226560 829 13\u2008909 5\u00b796% (5\u00b757\u20136\u00b737) 9\u00b749% (9\u00b711\u20139\u00b795) 6\u00b738% (5\u00b770\u20137\u00b717) 3\u00b728% (1\u00b782\u20136\u00b718)\nCrude case fatality ratios are presented as mean (95% confidence interval).

The estimated case fatality ratio was lower in those aged under 60 years of age (1\u00b74% [0\u00b74\u20133\u00b75]) compared with those aged 60 years and over (4\u00b75% [1\u00b78\u201311\u00b71]).

Adjusting for demography and under-ascertainment, we estimate an infection fatality ratio of 0\u00b766% (95% CrI 0\u00b739\u20131\u00b733). As for the case fatality ratio, this is strongly age-dependent, with estimates rising steeply from age 50 years upwards (table 1). The demography-adjusted and under-ascertainment-adjusted proportion of infected individuals requiring hospitalisation ranges from 1\u00b71% in the 20\u201329 years age group up to 18\u00b74% in those 80 years and older (table 3). Using these age-stratified infection fatality ratio estimates, we estimate the infection fatality ratio in the Diamond Princess population to be 2\u00b79%. Given the delay from onset of symptoms to death, we would expect 97% of these deaths to have occurred by March 25, 2020, giving an estimate of the current infection fatality ratio of 2\u00b78%, compared with the empirical estimate of 1\u00b74% (95% CI 0\u00b77\u20132\u00b76; ten of 712).\nTable 3Estimates of the proportion of all infections that would lead to hospitalisation, obtained from a subset of cases reported in mainland China18\nSevere cases All cases Proportion of infected individuals hospitalised\n0\u20139 years 0 13 0\u00b700% (0\u00b700\u20130\u00b700)\n10\u201319 years 1 50 0\u00b70408% (0\u00b70243\u20130\u00b70832)\n20\u201329 years 49 437 1\u00b704% (0\u00b7622\u20132\u00b713)\n30\u201339 years 124 733 3\u00b743% (2\u00b704\u20137\u00b700)\n40\u201349 years 154 743 4\u00b725% (2\u00b753\u20138\u00b768)\n50\u201359 years 222 790 8\u00b716% (4\u00b786\u201316\u00b77)\n60\u201369 years 201 560 11\u00b78% (7\u00b701\u201324\u00b70)\n70\u201379 years 133 263 16\u00b76% (9\u00b787\u201333\u00b78)\n\u226580 years 51 76 18\u00b74% (11\u00b70\u201337\u00b76)\nProportions of infected individuals hospitalised are presented as posterior mode (95% credible interval) and are adjusted for under-ascertainment and corrected for demography.

Although this value remains lower than estimates for other coronaviruses, including SARS24\nand Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS),25\nit is substantially higher than estimates from the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic.26\n,  27\nOur estimate of an infection fatality ratio of 0\u00b766% in China was informed by PCR testing of international Wuhan residents returning on repatriation flights. This value was consistent with the infection fatality ratio observed in passengers on the Diamond Princess cruise ship up to March 5, 2020, although it is slightly above the upper 95% confidence limit of the age-adjusted infection fatality ratio observed by March 25 (of 712 confirmed cases, 601 have been discharged, ten have died, and 11 remain in a critical condition). This difference might be due to repatriation flight data slightly underestimating milder infections, or due to cruise passengers having better outcomes because of a potentially higher-than-average quality of health care.Our estimates of the probability of requiring hospitalisation assume that only severe cases require hospitalisation. This assumption is clearly different from the pattern of hospitalisation that occurred in China, where hospitalisation was also used to ensure case isolation. Mortality can also be expected to vary with the underlying health of specific populations, given that the risks associated with COVID-19 will be heavily influenced by the presence of underlying comorbidities.Our estimate of the case fatality ratio is substantially lower than the crude case fatality ratio obtained from China based on the cases and deaths observed to date, which is currently 3\u00b767%, as well as many of the estimates currently in the literature. The principle reason for this difference is that the crude estimate does not take into account the severity of cases. For example, various estimates have been made from patient populations ranging from those with generally milder symptoms (for example international travellers detected through screening of travel history)13\nthrough to those identified in the hospital setting.14\n,  15It is clear from the data that have emerged from China that case fatality ratio increases substantially with age. Our results suggest a very low fatality ratio in those under the age of 20 years. As there are very few cases in this age group, it remains unclear whether this reflects a low risk of death or a difference in susceptibility, although early results indicate young people are not at lower risk of infection than adults.28\nSerological testing in this age group will be crucial in the coming weeks to understand the significance of this age group in driving population transmission. The estimated increase in severity with age is clearly reflected in case reports, in which the mean age tends to be in the range of 50\u201360 years. Different surveillance systems will pick up a different age case mix, and we find that those with milder symptoms detected through a history of travel are younger on average than those detected through hospital surveillance. Our correction for this surveillance bias therefore allows us to obtain estimates that can be applied to different case mixes and demographic population structures. However, it should be noted that this correction is applicable under the assumption of a uniform infection attack rate (ie, exposure) across the population. We also assumed perfect case ascertainment outside of Wuhan in the age group with the most cases relative to their population size (50\u201359-year-olds); however, if many cases were missed, the case fatality ratio and infection fatality ratio estimates might be lower. In the absence of random population surveys of infection prevalence, our adjustment from case fatality ratio to infection fatality ratio relied on repatriation flight data, which was not age specific. The reported proportion of infected individuals who were asymptomatic on the Diamond Princess did not vary considerably by age, supporting this approach, but future larger representative population prevalence surveys and seroprevalence surveys will inform such estimates further.Much of the data informing global estimates of the case fatality ratio at present are from the early outbreak in Wuhan. Given that the health system in this city was quickly overwhelmed, our estimates suggest that there is substantial under-ascertainment of cases in the younger age groups (who we estimate to have milder disease) by comparison with elsewhere in mainland China. This under-ascertainment is the main factor driving the difference between our estimate of the crude case fatality ratio from China (3\u00b767%) and our best estimate of the overall case fatality ratio (1\u00b738%). The case fatality ratio is likely to be strongly influenced by the availability of health-care facilities. However surprisingly, although health-care availability in Wuhan was stretched, our estimates from international cases are of a similar magnitude, suggesting relatively little difference in health outcome. Finally, as clinical knowledge of this new disease accrues, it is possible that outcomes will improve. It will therefore be important to revise these estimates as epidemics unfold.The world is currently experiencing the early stages of a global pandemic. Although China has succeeded in containing the disease spread for 2 months, such containment is unlikely to be achievable in most countries. Thus, much of the world will experience very large community epidemics of COVID-19 over the coming weeks and months. Our estimates of the underlying infection fatality ratio of this virus will inform assessments of health effects likely to be experienced in different countries, and thus decisions around appropriate mitigation policies to be adopted.This online publication has been corrected.

The outbreaks of these diseases resulted in wide ranging socioeconomic consequences, including loss of lives and disruption to trade and travel. Preparedness is a crucial investment because its cost is small compared with the unmitigated impact of a health emergency. The financing gap for preparedness, estimated at US$4\u00b75 billion per year, is miniscule compared with estimated pandemic costs of $570 billion per year.1\n\n,  2Within urban settings, preparedness activities have the added challenge of navigating a host of disruptive determinants that demand innovative solutions, especially the way in which diseases and their human hosts behave.3\nEnsuring that urban settings are prepared for emerging infectious diseases is crucially important. In 2018, 55% of the world's population (4\u00b72 billion people) resided in urban areas, and this proportion might increase to 68% by 2050.4\n\nEmerging infectious diseases also either originate in urban settings, such as the emergence of COVID-19 in Wuhan, China, or rapidly propagate because of urbanisation once they are established, such as outbreaks of SARS in 2003 and Zika virus disease in the Americas.5\n,  6\n,  7\u2022 View related content for this articleMany cities are important hubs of travel and trade; hence an uncontained outbreak would result in severe economic consequences beyond lives lost. More importantly, these urban centres risk becoming conduits of transmission to the world. As seen from the spread of COVID-19, diseases now follow major patterns of travel connections both domestically (with major cities in China connected by high speed rail) and internationally through flights.8\nFor example, as of Feb 17, 2020, there were 172 exported cases of COVID-19 from China to 25 countries, with 156 secondary cases in 14 countries, and these were mostly in major cities with travel connections to China.9Urban settings have some common characteristics, many of which are disruptive factors that need to be addressed for effective preparedness.3\nFor example, the density of people in housing, during commutes using public transportation, and in work environments is high. Inequalities, exacerbated by the rapid influx of people from rural areas, often results in poor housing, insufficient supply of fresh water, poor sanitation facilities, and ineffective ventilation systems, all of which increase outbreak risks. Rapid urbanisation might lead to encroachment into natural habitats and closer encounters with wildlife and zoonoses, and increased proximity to animals in backyard farms and food markets also provides opportunities for zoonotic infections. Both SARS and COVID-19 might have originated from food markets, and of the 335 emerging infectious diseases recognised between 1940 and 2004, more than 60% were of zoonotic origin.10Ensuring better preparedness in urban settings will require a fresh emphasis on strengthening capacities to deal with outbreaks and other health emergencies. Many of these efforts are applicable across all settings, urban or otherwise, such as having a good understanding of the local socioeconomic and cultural milieu and an active involvement of communities and local leaders in both planning and implementation. However, urban settings also offer new opportunities (table), such as securing the commitment of local leaders and strengthening public health networks to prevent, detect, and respond to disease threats early. Businesses can be appropriately engaged to manage employees in an emergency, and risk communication can be pushed through prevalent social media networks. Many lessons will also be learned from the city-wide community containment measures in Wuhan\u2014the largest community quarantine exercise in history\u2014and other containment measures rolled out in other Chinese cities and in Singapore.\nTableChallenges, and opportunities for epidemic preparedness associated with characteristics of urban settings\nChallenges Opportunities\nHigh population density and high volume of public transportation A larger population to be managed; ease of disease spread between humans in congested areas; difficulties in contact tracing, especially causal contact in public areas; inequalities resulting in poor housing environments that might hinder outbreak prevention and control efforts; closer encounters with wildlife via food markets or because of expansion into previously untouched ecosystems Urban planners can consider epidemic preparedness in their designs and implementation; transport networks can be used to rapidly move supplies to outbreak epicentres; harnessing advancement in technologies for more effective contact tracing\nInterface between animals and humans Areas of poor sanitation with rodents and other animal vectors; live domestic and wild animal markets; animals raised in backyard farms or industrial agricultural facilities in close proximity to humans Improved sanitation and rodent control around humans and animal communities; vaccination of domestic animals for common zoonotic infections; precautions at slaughter to prevent contact with blood; regulating live animal markets to phase out sale of live animals or to ensure that those for sale are raised on commercial farms and have been verified to be disease free\nGovernance by local authorities Competing interests within a finite local budget; insufficient authority to institute response measures promptly; insufficient epidemic preparedness capabilities or capacities at a subnational and local level; difficulties in accessing national capacities Leaders in cities would be better placed to develop and implement effective and contextually appropriate solutions; consolidated local surveillance data can improve sense-making at the national level; local leaders can be engaged to advocate for greater investments in local systems\nHeterogeneous subpopulations A wide range of cultural factors, including modes of social interactions and acceptable control measures; some subpopulations might be difficult to reach Community leaders can be mobilised for targeted approaches to preparedness and response; innovative solutions can be shared and adapted across cultures\nHigh connectivity to other urban centres (domestic and international) High likelihood of multiple importation events; risk of rapid export of disease to other parts of the country or to other countries; fear might lead to restrictions on travel and trade Evidence-based points of entry measures and exit screening measures can be implemented; trust can be built through strong diplomatic relations to allow for better collaboration\nCentres of commerce Greater disruption to economic activity, stability, and growth Businesses and corporations can be engaged in business continuity plans that also prevent further spread, as part of a whole-of-society approach\nUnconventional communications and interactions Multiple information sources leading to misinformation; false information might spread quickly Unconventional but reliable information channels and social media can be used for risk communication\nOpen table in a new tabMany urban settings now have substantial expertise and experience in preparing for and dealing with health emergencies. Having had large outbreaks of infectious diseases, authorities in some urban areas have developed purpose-built surveillance systems that make use of digital and web-based information.11\nOther local authorities have established surge capacity and contingency plans, including strong links with health-care facilities and national coordination bodies.12\nIn some urban settings, complex simulation exercises have been run and disease spread has been modelled to determine the most effective public health actions to control the spread of infectious diseases.13\nThere is room for sharing of best practices and measures in urban settings. Having an assessment and evaluation tool that is tailored for urban settings might also be useful for preparedness planning.The ongoing pandemic of COVID-19 is a strong reminder that urbanisation has changed the way that people and communities live, work, and interact, and the need to strengthen systems and local capacities to prevent the spread of infectious diseases is urgent. As a global community, we must collectively invest in and build strong preparedness systems that are better adapted to increasingly urbanised settings.We declare no competing interests.", "S1473-30992030200-0": "Background\nOn Dec 31, 2019, China reported a cluster of cases of pneumonia in people at Wuhan, Hubei Province.

More specifically, these studies have reported the most common symptoms, incubation periods, biological abnormalities, radiographic abnormalities, CT abnormalities, and treatment data. In addition, they have described varying degrees of illness and their severity: mild, severe, or critical. They have reported proportion of complications, including acute respiratory distress syndrome, or case fatality rates, and variables associated with these complications and death.1\n,  5\n,  6\n,  7\n,  8\n,  9In this Article, through a detailed and comprehensive sampling strategy, we report the clinical and biological features of the first five cases of confirmed COVID-19 in Europe, which occurred in France, and their dynamics in parallel with changes in their viral load, based on severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA detection.Research in context\nEvidence before this study\nWe searched PubMed Central for all studies or reports presenting clinical characteristics of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), using the terms \u201cCOVID-19\u201d and \u201cclinical\u201d or \u201c2019-nCoV\u201d and \u201cclinical\u201d from database inception to Feb 24, 2020.

They reported proportion of complications, including acute respiratory distress syndrome, or case fatality rates and variables associated with these complications and death. In addition, these studies reported data on virus shedding. They studied in particular dynamics of the viral load in sputum, urine, throat swab, and stool samples in symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals. They also evaluated virus shedding in patients who had recovered.\nAdded value of this study\nThis study reports clinical data from the first patients diagnosed with COVID-19 in Europe. The study also brings to the field some new and original findings by including patients at different stages of infection (ie, at very early stages or later in the course of the disease) and through a detailed and comprehensive sampling strategy; patients enrolled early being contacts of patients enrolled later during the course of the disease. To our knowledge, the association between clinical evolution and the virological dynamic has not been reported in the past. It allowed us to describe three patterns: paucisymptomatic patients diagnosed very quickly over their disease course, with an early high nasopharyngeal shedding of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) within the first 24 h of the illness onset (5\u00b72 and 7\u00b74 log10 copies per 1000 cells, respectively); patients with a two-step disease progression, with a secondary worsening around 10 days after disease onset despite a decreasing viral load in nasopharyngeal samples; and a patient with a rapid evolution towards multiple organ failure and a persistent high viral load in lower and upper respiratory tract with systemic virus dissemination and virus detection in plasma (ie, an old patient).\nImplications of all the available evidence\nPaucisymptomatic patients, because of high viral loads in upper respiratory tract samples, might potentially transmit the disease during the very first days of symptoms despite having a mild presentation of the disease. The implication is that COVID-19 control measures should combine immediate isolation of cases after symptom onset together with a rapid screening and monitoring of the contacts of infected patients. In patients with severe disease, two patterns were identified. The first pattern was a biphasic evolution starting with a mild presentation followed by a secondary respiratory worsening despite a decreasing viral load in the nasopharyngeal samples, suggesting that the lung damage at this phase is more related to immunopathological lesions. The second pattern, observed in the most severely ill patient who died, was a persistent and high viral excretion in the upper respiratory tract samples combined with a positive virus detection in other body fluids including blood. These findings will contribute to better understanding of the natural history of the disease and in tailoring treatment strategies.Evidence before this studyWe searched PubMed Central for all studies or reports presenting clinical characteristics of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), using the terms \u201cCOVID-19\u201d and \u201cclinical\u201d or \u201c2019-nCoV\u201d and \u201cclinical\u201d from database inception to Feb 24, 2020.

All patients at French hospitals who were diagnosed with COVID-19 according to the French National Health Agency criteria were enrolled in this cohort from Jan 24 to Jan 29, 2020.5Together with the French National Regulatory authorities and French Ministry of Health, on Jan 25, 2020, we determined the indication criteria for compassionate use of an investigational antiviral treatment (remdesivir) as signs of severe illness at diagnosis or secondary clinical aggravation (respiratory symptoms or general signs) based on WHO criteria for severe pneumonia caused by SARS-CoV-210\n\n(appendix p 2). On the basis of expert opinion and available data in January, 2020, we considered that remdesivir might be the best potential drug for the treatment of COVID-19, although restricted to patients with severe disease (intravenous route, a loading dose of 200 mg, then maintenance daily dose of 100 mg for a total duration of 10 days). Criteria for discharge with total recovery were from European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control guidelines: asymptomatic patients with two RT-PCR negative nasopharyngeal samples at least 48 h apart.11The five patients in this case series, at different stages of infection, include two patients with a mild disease at admission and a secondary worsening that resulted in their admission to an intensive care unit (ICU), one initially severely ill patient directly admitted to an ICU for an acute respiratory failure, and two patients with a mild disease diagnosed very early after infection.We used the open-access Clinical Characterization Protocol for Severe Emerging Infections of the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium, supported by WHO,12\nwhich has been updated in response to COVID-19. This study was approved by the French Ethics Committee, and written informed consent was obtained from each patient involved or their next of kin.Clinical samples for SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic testing were obtained according to WHO guidelines.13\n\nFor each patient, a sampling strategy was implemented in which samples were obtained once daily for 3 days from hospital admission, and subsequently once every 2 or 3 days until patient discharge or death. Upper and lower (when possible) respiratory tract samples, and also blood, urine, and stool samples (or rectal swabs, if appropriate) were obtained. Upper respiratory samples were either nasopharyngeal aspirates or nasopharyngeal swabs (Sigma Virocult, Medical Wire Instrument, Corsham, UK), stool samples were either faecal swabs or stools, and blood samples were EDTA tube adapted for RT-PCR. All samples were refrigerated and shipped to the laboratories of the National Reference Center for Respiratory Viruses (The Institut Pasteur, Paris, and Hospices Civils de Lyon, Lyon, France), where procedures for RNA extraction, real-time RT-PCR (rtRT-PCR), and virus isolation and titration were undertaken. RNA extraction was done with the Extraction NucleoSpin Dx Virus kit (Macherey Nagel, D\u00fcren, Germany) or by the automated NucliSENS easyMAG (bioM\u00e9rieux, Marcy-l'\u00c9toile, France), using the manufacturers' instructions. RdRp-IP1 and RdRp quantitative rtRT-PCR (appendix p 4) was used for detection of SARS-CoV-2. The RdRp RT-PCR corresponds to the Charit\u00e9 protocol.14\nWhen a sample (respiratory samples, plasma, or stool) was positive with RdRp-IP1, quantification of the number of RNA copies was done according to a scale ranging from 103 to 106 copies per \u03bcL. The viral load in stools was calculated as previously described15\nand expressed in number of RNA copies per g of stool. The quality of nasopharyngeal swabs was checked using the CELL Control r-gene kit (bioM\u00e9rieux). This kit is provided with quantified plasmid for cellular quantification. All viral loads for respiratory samples were calculated with the same method as for stools15\nand normalised according to the cellular quantification as the number of RNA copies per 1000 cells. All positive plasma samples were quantified and expressed as number of RNA copies per mL. Primer and probe sequences (Eurogentec, Seraing, Belgium; appendix p 4) either correspond to the RdRp or E gene assay from the Charit\u00e9 protocol14\nor to the RdRp-IP1 assay designed at The Institut Pasteur to target a section of the RdRp gene based on the first sequences of SARS-CoV-2 made available on the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data database on Jan 11, 2020 (appendix p 5). For further details on RNA extraction, high-throughput virus sequencing, and virus titration and isolation see the appendix (pp 2\u20133).The funder of this study had no role in study design, data collection, data analysis, data interpretation, and writing of the report. The corresponding author had full access to study data and final responsibility for the decision to submit for publication.The main clinical and biological characteristics of the five patients at hospital admission are presented in table 1. All patients but patient 3 were diagnosed with COVID-19 on the day of their hospital admission. Patient 3 was diagnosed 3 days after because he did not fulfil the National Health Agency case definition at admission (no history of travel to or residence in the city of Wuhan). On Feb 19, 2020, all patients except patient 3 had fully recovered and were discharged.

He was diagnosed with COVID-19 on Jan 24, 2020 (illness day 6), 5 days after his arrival in Paris with his wife (patient 4). He visited a hospital in Wuhan on Jan 16 for a gout episode. He had influenza-like symptoms (table 1) from Jan 19 (illness day 1), and was admitted to hospital on the day of the diagnosis with mild lymphopenia, thrombopenia, and no abnormalities on the chest x-ray. On illness day 10, he was transferred to an ICU because of worsening of oxygen saturation (PO2=58 mm Hg; flow nasal cannula 4 L/min), and bilateral lung abnormalities including ground-glass opacities, reticulo-nodular syndrome, and alveolar opacities on chest CT scan (appendix p 6). A loading dose of remdesivir was administered on Jan 29 (illness day 11), followed by maintenance treatment. On Jan 31, he was discharged back to the infectious diseases ward. On illness day 15, remdesivir treatment was discontinued because of alanine aminotransferase elevation (levels three times higher than the upper limit of normal) and a maculopapular rash, without any anaphylaxis, eosinophilia, or systemic symptoms. The patient was screened for hepatitis B and C, cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus, and herpes simplex virus, and no active infection was detected. Skin and liver abnormalities decreased within 3 days. The patient became asymptomatic the following day. He was discharged on Feb 12.Patient 2 was a 48-year old man of Chinese origin, based in France. He travelled for business to China and flew back from Shanghai to France on Jan 22, 2020. He did not report any specific exposures within the 14 days before symptom onset except a 3-day stay at Wuhan. Arterial hypertension was his only underlying disease. Influenza-like symptoms started on Jan 16, and he was diagnosed on Jan 24 (illness day 9) at Pellegrin University Hospital and admitted to this hospital. On illness day 11, he was transferred to an ICU with fever of more than 38\u00b75\u00b0C and skin mottling suggesting sepsis. On Jan 29, a CT scan showed bilateral lung abnormalities including ground-glass opacities, reticulo-nodular syndrome, and scarce alveolar opacities. In the ICU, a loading dose of remdesivir was administered on Jan 30 (illness day 15), followed by maintenance treatment until Feb 8. After full recovery, he was discharged on Feb 14.Patient 3 had a rapidly progressive disease classified as critical at diagnosis. Patient 3 was an 80-year-old Chinese male tourist from Yichang (Hubei Province, China) and was diagnosed with COVID-19 on Jan 28, 2020 (illness day 7), 11 days after his arrival in Europe with his daughter (patient 5). He did not report any specific exposure within the 14 days before symptom onset. He had a thyroid cancer removed in 2010. He had fever and diarrhoea from Jan 22, and went to the emergency room in another hospital on Jan 25, where the chest x-ray showed bilateral alveolar opacities. He did not fulfil the COVID-19 case definition. However, airborne and contact precautions were observed during his hospital stay before COVID-19 diagnosis. On Jan 26, an acute respiratory failure triggered his ICU admission to Bichat-Claude Bernard University Hospital. He subsequently developed multiple organ failure with acute respiratory distress syndrome, acute kidney injury, liver failure, and sepsis-like shock. After the COVID-19 diagnosis was confirmed on Jan 28, he was transferred to the referent ICU at Bichat-Claude Bernard Hospital in Paris, where broad-spectrum antibacterials were started for a possible superinfection. Remdesivir was started with a loading dose. As two pathogens were identified, a susceptible Acinetobacter baumannii (multiplex PCR, confirmed by tracheal aspirates culture) and an Aspergillus flavus (tracheal aspirates culture), the anti-infective treatment was adapted. We treated A baumanii with meropenem, tigecycline, and colimycin followed by meropenem and levofloxacin. We initially treated A flavus with voriconazole but switched to isavuconazole because voriconazole and remdesivir both contain sulphobutylether-\u03b2-cyclodextrin, and the safety of this association has not been evaluated yet. Remdesivir was discontinued on Jan 30 because the patient needed renal replacement therapy. CT scan on Jan 31 showed a bilateral pleuropneumopathy including pleural effusion, alveolar condensations, ground-glass opacities, and pulmonary cysts. On Feb 5, because of the severity of the disease and persistence of viral detection, and as the risk\u2013benefit assessment was considered favourable, remdesivir was reinitiated. Multiple organ failure persisted despite appropriate treatment against A baumannii and A flavus and no other superinfection was identified. The patient died on Feb 14 (illness day 24).Patients 4 and 5 were admitted to hospital early after the onset of the symptoms, and were classified as having mild disease.9\nPatient 4 (patient 1's wife), a 30-year-old Chinese woman, was diagnosed with COVID-19 on Jan 24, 2020, at Bichat-Claude Bernard University Hospital (illness day 2), 5 days after her arrival in Paris. She had spent those days with patient 1. She had moderate influenza-like symptoms from Jan 23 (illness day 1), with no abnormalities on the chest x-ray. After some days of persistent and incapacitating cough, her condition improved without any specific treatment. She became asymptomatic on Feb 2 (illness day 11) and was discharged on Feb 12.Patient 5 (patients 3's daughter), a 46-year-old Chinese woman, was diagnosed with COVID-19 on Jan 29, 2020 (illness day 2). She had stayed with patient 3 since their travel from China. She had mild symptoms, with sore throat and dry cough from Jan 28 (illness day 1), and a normal chest x-ray. Her cough, which was initially mild, increased transiently over time; she was asymptomatic from Feb 4 (illness day 8) without any specific treatment, and was discharged on Feb 17.Patients 4 and 5 had nasopharyngeal samples collected within the first 24 h of illness onset, allowing an early diagnosis of COVID-19. These early specimens had a high viral load, enabling whole-genome virus sequencing and virus isolation (table 2). The maximal normalised viral load obtained in their respiratory specimens were at 5\u00b72 log10 copies per 1000 cells for patient 4 and 7\u00b74 log10 copies per 1000 cells for patient 5 (based on the RdRp quantitative rtRT-PCR). This viral load in respiratory samples decreased over time (figure 2). SARS-CoV-2 detection by RT-PCR was negative on illness day 12 for patient 4 and on illness day 16 for patient 5 (figure 2). These patients also had a positive detection of SARS-CoV-2 in stools, with viral load as high as 6\u00b78 log10 copies per g of stool for patient 4 and 8\u00b71 log10 copies per g of stool for patient 5. However, the virus was not detected in the serum or the urine samples.\nTable 2Confirmation of COVID-19 by RT-PCR, whole genome sequencing, and virus isolation\nSamples RT-PCR targets Virus sequence Virus isolate titre (PFU/mL)\nDay post symptom onset Nature RdRp14\n(cycle threshold) E gene14\n(cycle threshold) RdRp-IP1(cycle threshold) GAPDH(cycle threshold)\nPatient 1 6 Nasopharyngeal swab 28\u00b75 27\u00b73 26\u00b77 27\u00b74 EPI_ISL406597*\nNo\nPatient 2 9 Nasopharyngeal swab Negative 34\u00b77 33\u00b70 27\u00b71 No No\nPatient 3 7 Nasopharyngeal swab Negative 30\u00b73 29\u00b72 25\u00b77 Partial No\nPatient 3 7 Bronchoalveolar lavage Negative 27\u00b74 27\u00b73 24\u00b77 Partial No\nPatient 4 2 Nasopharyngeal swab 23\u00b76 22\u00b78 23\u00b70 26\u00b75 EPI_ISL406596 6\u00b725\u2008\u00d7\u2008105\nPatient 5 2 Nasopharyngeal swab 24\u00b73 20\u00b70 19\u00b73 25\u00b76 EPI_ISL408430 3\u00b70\u2008\u00d7\u2008107\nCOVID-19=coronavirus disease 2019.

PFU=plaque-forming unit.Patient 1 had nasopharyngeal samples collected at illness day 6 and patient 2 on day 9, which were positive by rtRT-PCR, with a SARS-CoV-2 viral load of 7\u00b71 log10 copies per 1000 cells, and detected but not quantifiable viral load, respectively. The whole-genome virus sequence was obtained by direct sequencing for patient 1 only; virus isolation was unsuccessful in both cases. The secondary evolution to severe disease in these two patients (days 10 and 11) was not correlated to any viral load increase (figure 2). Both received intravenous remdesivir when the viral load had already decreased below the detection threshold. During the whole course of the disease of these two patients, SARS-CoV-2 detection by RT-PCR was negative in stools, serum, and urine.At illness day 6, patient 3 (whose disease was classified as critical) was positive by RT-PCR in both a nasopharyngeal sample and bronchoalveolar lavage, with cycle threshold values for the E gene target (Charit\u00e9 protocol14\n) of 30\u00b73 and 27\u00b74, and similar cycle threshold values for the house-keeping gene GAPDH of 25\u00b77 and 24\u00b77, respectively (table 2). The SARS-CoV-2 titres in the nasopharynx were stable (from 6\u00b77 to 4\u00b74 log10 copies per 1000 cells) over time, although with a trend towards decrease after the first intravenous remdesivir dose, and thereafter when remdesivir was reinitiated (figure 2). This patient had a RNAaemia on illness day 8 and subsequently, with a low viral load (detected but below the quantification limit). During the course of the disease, he developed a pleural exudative effusion, with SARS-CoV-2 detection positive in the pleural fluid and negative bacterial cultures.Figure 3 illustrates the kinetics of the viral load in nasopharyngeal samples of all patients after disease onset. The viral load decreased over time and became negative between illness day 9 and 14 in four patients (patients 1, 2, 4, and 5). In the most severely ill patient (patient 3), nasopharyngeal virus detection persisted until death.\nFigure 3Overall dynamics of the nasopharyngeal viral load and virus detection in other body fluids in the five COVID-19 cases in France\nShow full caption\nView Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)When available, the sequence analysis of the virus of these patients showed that patients 1 and 4 compared with patient 5 correspond to two distinct events of importation. For patients 1 and 4, the virus was clustering with viruses from cases in Wuhan, Shenzhen (China), California (USA), Australia, and Taiwan, whereas for patient 5 the virus was clustering with those from Chongqing (China) and Singapore (the genetic epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 is available online). Furthermore, the very high degree of identity of the sequences from patients 1 and 4 supports the epidemiological link between these cases and the likelihood of transmission.In this case series of five patients with COVID-19, we illustrated three different clinical and biological types of evolution: first, mild cases through two paucisymptomatic patients aged younger than 50 years who were diagnosed early, with high viral load in nasopharyngeal samples, suggesting a significant shedding of SARS-CoV-2, reflected by virus detection by RT-PCR; second, two young patients presenting with mild symptoms at admission and experiencing a secondary progression to pneumonia and severe disease by days 10\u201311; and third, an older patient with a rapid evolution towards critical disease with multiple organ failure and a long and sustained persistence of SARS-CoV-2 nasopharyngeal detection associated with viral RNA detection in multiple sites, including blood.Among the five cases investigated here, the two patients with mild disease were diagnosed at an early stage of the disease because they had a contact with a confirmed case. High viral loads in upper respiratory tract samples are suggestive of potentially high risk of transmissibility during the very first days of symptoms. This finding is in line with data reported by Zou and colleagues, who analysed viral load in the upper respiratory tract in relation to day of onset of symptoms in 17 symptomatic patients in whom higher viral loads were detected soon after symptom onset.16\nThis observation suggests that the virus shedding pattern of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 is different from that seen with SARS-CoV, in which the virus load was very low at disease onset.17\n,  18\n,  19\nThese findings might affect the implementation of infection control measures. The implication is that COVID-19 control measures should combine immediate isolation of patients with the disease together with a rapid screening and monitoring of the contacts of these patients to detect those with very mild symptoms. In two of five patients reported here, SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in stool samples. This possible route of transmission must be investigated; detection of viral RNA does not necessarily imply that infectious particles are present and transmissible,20\nparticularly when patients, such as these two individuals, have no diarrhoea or other gastrointestinal symptoms.In this case series, except for the patient with critical disease, the viral load decreased over time and became negative between illness day 9 and day 14. Of note, the virus was also detected by rtRT-PCR at low levels in the upper respiratory tract, even after full resolution of symptoms. Whether infectious virus might be still present despite symptom resolution will require further attempts of virus isolation. This uncertainty justifies the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control recommendation to obtain two RT-PCR negative nasopharyngeal samples before discharge of asymptomatic patients.11\n\nThis conservative recommendation is, however, no longer feasible in many European countries that are in an epidemic situation.In this case series, three patients had a severe or critical disease with two different patterns. The first one, in patients with severe diseases (patients 1 and 2), is characterised by a biphasic evolution starting with a mild presentation followed with a secondary respiratory worsening despite a decreasing viral load in the nasopharyngeal samples: SARS-CoV-2 was no longer detected in the upper respiratory tract in one patient and at very low levels in the other. In patients with this pattern, a CT scan at the moment of the worsening showed ground-glass lung opacities, in line with those reported by others in patients with COVID-19.8\n,  20\nTime to worsening of respiratory symptoms was around 10 days after disease onset in these two cases, close to the median disease duration before worsening (8\u00b70 days [IQR 5\u00b70\u201313\u00b70]), previously reported by Huang and collaborators.6\nIn these patients, one might postulate that the lung damage is more related to immunopathological lesions, resulting from an excessive pro-inflammatory host response, rather than to uncontrolled viral replication.6\nOf note, we did not assess virus load in low respiratory tract samples from these two patients.The second pattern, observed in the patient classified as having critical disease and who died (patient 3), consists of a persistent and high viral excretion in the upper respiratory tract samples combined with positive virus detection by rtRT-PCR in other body fluids, including blood. By contrast with the previous pattern, this persistent high viral load suggests the ability of the SARS-CoV-2 to evade the immune response. Indeed, we can speculate that, as shown during Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and SARS coronavirus infections,21\n,  22\nSARS-CoV-2 might be able to inhibit the interferon signalling pathways, resulting in higher respiratory virus load, positive viraemia, and eventually poor prognosis, as for MERS-CoV.23\n,  24\nIndeed, the 80-year-old patient, unlike the other cases, had evidence of high viral replication in the respiratory tract and evidence for systemic virus dissemination beyond the respiratory tract, with virus detection in plasma and pleural effusion fluid. The impaired immune response might have facilitated the bacterial and fungal superinfections. Patients with similar, severe patterns (sustained viral RNA in the respiratory tract and detection of SARS-CoV-2 in the blood) have also been reported in China.6\nAs reported in previous studies,12\n,  25\nseverely ill patients are often older patient with comorbidities. Patient 3 was aged 80 years and might have had an impaired interferon pathway.These different patterns, and especially the fact that patients with severe or critical disease might have different viral kinetics in the upper respiratory tract, might be important. The findings suggest that different therapeutic approaches, based on viral kinetics monitoring, might be needed in patients with a virus load decrease in the upper respiratory tract versus those with high viral replication and systemic virus dissemination. We should be cautious when analysing these data because of the small number of patients, but adapting treatment to the clinical course should be considered in future studies.There is no currently validated antiviral treatment to control such SARS-CoV-2 infections. Among potential candidates, remdesivir is an antiviral prodrug (nucleosidic analogue family) that has broad-spectrum in-vitro and in-vivo activity against numerous RNA viruses, including SARS-CoV-2. In animal models, compared with lopinavir plus ritonavir combined with interferon beta, two other potential candidates, remdesivir more significantly reduced the virus titre of mice infected with the MERS-CoV and decreased the lung tissue damage.26\nRemdesivir treatment improved disease outcomes and reduced viral loads in SARS-CoV-infected mice27\nand is inhibitory for SARS-CoV-2 in vitro.28\nA phase 3 clinical trial assessed this drug for the treatment of Ebola virus infection; therefore, data exist for the safety of use in humans.29\nHence, on the basis of expert opinion, we considered remdesivir use in the three patients with severe disease patterns. To the best of our knowledge, only one case of remdesivir use in COVID-19 has been reported so far.20\nTwo randomised controlled trials are enrolling patients in China to assess the clinical benefit of this treatment (NCT04257656; NCT04252664). On the basis of our data, we cannot draw any conclusions on the potential efficacy of remdesivir on COVID-19 infections. In two patients, the drug was initiated at the time of disease worsening, when the virus was already barely detectable in the clinical specimens. In one of them, remdesivir was discontinued after 5 days because of a combined alanine aminotransferase elevation and a rash, although it could not be confirmed that this adverse event was related to remdesivir. In the third patient, remdesivir was discontinued after a single dose because of renal replacement therapy to avoid risk of cyclodextrin accumulation. Remdesivir contains cyclodextrin, an excipient whose clearance is linearly related to creatinine clearance. Because the patient's condition was worsening and viral load was not decreasing, we reinitiated remdesivir.In this paper, we report clinical and virological data on the first cases of COVID-19 in Europe. Although we acknowledge the fact that the results provided are based on a small number of cases, a detailed and comprehensive sampling strategy enabled us to illustrate the different courses of the disease we observed, and provide some relevant criteria regarding the severity of disease. We believe that these findings will contribute to better understanding of the natural history of the disease and will contribute to advances in the implementation of more efficient infection control strategies.ContributorsF-XL, LB, DN, MP, P-HW, AM, J-CL, FM, XD, DM, J-FT, and YY collected the clinical and epidemiological data, and summarised all data.

The detailed clinical features of five patients with COVID-19 are aligned with the quantitative severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) viral RNA load from nasopharyngeal and other selected sampling sites. Previous studies in patients with SARS, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), and COVID-19 generally provide insufficient detail to allow examination of the relationship between individual patient clinical course and viral RNA load.2\n,  3\n,  4\nAlthough patient numbers are small, the authors provide the first COVID-19 time series correlating viral RNA load and detailed clinical manifestations.1\nImportantly, the dataset is provided in sufficient detail so it could be readily combined with future similar studies for deeper analysis.Although the authors make a case for COVID-19 presenting as three distinct clinical patterns, we believe a distinction based on such small numbers is highly speculative. Nevertheless, based on the assumption that viral RNA load correlates with high levels of viral replication,5\nthere are important insights to be gained from this time-course analysis. Currently, our understanding of the relationship between viral RNA load kinetics and disease severity in patients with COVID-19 remains fragmented. Zou and colleagues reported that patients with COVID-19 with more severe disease requiring intensive care unit admission had high viral RNA loads at 10 days and beyond, after symptom onset.4\nUnfortunately, it is unknown when in the course of their disease these patients deteriorated. By contrast, Lescure and colleagues report the viral RNA kinetics of two patients who developed late respiratory deterioration despite the disappearance of nasopharyngeal viral RNA. It would be interesting to know whether viral RNA load in lung tissue, or a surrogate sample such as tracheal aspirate, mirrors the decline in nasopharyngeal shedding. Nevertheless, this observation suggests that these late, severe manifestations might be immunologically mediated and has obvious implications for the potential to use immune-modulatory therapies for this subset of patients. This finding is consistent with recent reports that corticosteroids were beneficial for acute respiratory distress syndrome,6\nand possibly those with COVID-19.7\nWith more detailed data such as those provided by Lescure and colleagues, the use of viral RNA load to suggest potential clinical strategies to treat COVID-19 could be exploited.\u2022 View related content for this articleIn a pandemic, prevention of disease transmission is key. Lescure and colleagues wisely note the implications for transmission from patients with few symptoms but high viral RNA load in the nasopharynx early in the course of disease. Individuals within the community, policy makers, and frontline health-care providers, especially general and emergency room practitioners, should be alert and prepared to manage this risk. Equally worrying is the persistently high nasopharyngeal viral RNA load, and the detection of viral RNA in blood and pleural fluid, of the older patient (aged 80 years) with severe multi-organ dysfunction. This finding broadly correlates with the severely ill group data reported by Zou and colleagues,4\nand has important implications for therapy and infection control. Development and effective administration of antiviral therapy to critically ill patients throughout the course of disease is likely to remain important. Vigilance regarding the strict implementation of transmission precautions is required throughout the prolonged course of COVID-19 in patients who are critically ill, and ancillary staff responsible for collecting and disposing of bodily fluids or waste, who are at high risk during an outbreak,8\nshould be properly protected and trained.9It is noteworthy that the presence of viral RNA in specimens does not always correlate with viral transmissibility. In a ferret model of H1N1 infection, the loss of viral culture positivity but not the absence of viral RNA coincided with the end of the infectious period. In fact, real-time reverse transcriptase PCR results remained positive 6\u20138 days after the loss of transmissibility.10\nFor SARS coronavirus, viral RNA is detectable in the respiratory secretions and stools of some patients after onset of illness for more than 1 month, but live virus could not be detected by culture after week 3.11\nThe inability to differentiate between infective and non-infective (dead or antibody-neutralised) viruses remains a major limitation of nucleic acid detection. Despite this limitation, given the difficulties in culturing live virus from clinical specimens during a pandemic, using viral RNA load as a surrogate remains plausible for generating clinical hypotheses.View Large Image\nCopyright \u00a9 2020 Flickr/Alachua CountyWe declare no competing interests.", "S1473-30992030244-9": "Since the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) began in December, a question at the forefront of many people's minds has been its mortality rate. Is the mortality rate of COVID-19 higher than that of influenza, but lower than that of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)?The trend in mortality reporting for COVID-19 has been typical for emerging infectious diseases. The case fatality rate (CFR) was reported to be 15% (six of 41 patients) in the initial period,1\nbut this estimate was calculated from a small cohort of hospitalised patients. Subsequently, with more data emerging, the CFR decreased to between 4\u00b73% and 11\u00b70%,2\n,  3\nand later to 3\u00b74%.4\n\nThe rate reported outside China in February was even lower (0\u00b74%; two of 464).5\u2022 View related content for this articleThis pattern of decreasing CFRs is not surprising during the initial phase of an outbreak. Hard outcomes such as the CFR have a crucial part in forming strategies at national and international levels from a public health perspective. It is imperative that health-care leaders and policy makers are guided by estimates of mortality and case fatality.However, several factors can restrict obtaining an accurate estimate of the CFR. The virus and its clinical course are new, and we still have little information about them. Health care capacity and capability factors, including the availability of health-care workers, resources, facilities, and preparedness, also affect outcomes. For example, some countries are able to invest resources into contact tracing and containing the spread through quarantine and isolation of infected or suspected cases. In Singapore, where these measures have been implemented, the CFR of 631 cases (as of March 25, 2020) is 0\u00b73%. In other places, testing might not be widely available, and proactive contact tracing and containment might not be employed, resulting in a smaller denominator and skewing to a higher CFR. The CFR can increase in some places if there is a surge of infected patients, which adds to the strain on the health-care system and can overwhelm its medical resources.A major challenge with accurate calculation of the CFR is the denominator: the number of people who are infected with the virus. Asymptomatic cases of COVID-19, patients with mild symptoms, or individuals who are misdiagnosed could be left out of the denominator, leading to its underestimation and overestimation of the CFR.A unique situation has arisen for quite an accurate estimate of the CFR of COVID-19. Among individuals onboard the Diamond Princess cruise ship, data on the denominator are fairly robust. The outbreak of COVID-19 led passengers to be quarantined between Jan 20, and Feb 29, 2020. This scenario provided a population living in a defined territory without most other confounders, such as imported cases, defaulters of screening, or lack of testing capability. 3711 passengers and crew were onboard, of whom 705 became sick and tested positive for COVID-19 and seven died,6\n\ngiving a CFR of 0\u00b799%. If the passengers onboard were generally of an older age, the CFR in a healthy, younger population could be lower.7Although highly transmissible, the CFR of COVID-19 appears to be lower than that of SARS (9\u00b75%) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (34\u00b74%),8\nbut higher than that of influenza (0\u00b71%).9\n,  10We declare no competing interests.", "S1473-30992030233-4": "In December, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) emerged in Wuhan, China, causing a pandemic that continues to spread globally.1\n86 countries have reported cases.2\n\nAs of March 6, 2020, Egypt has reported three cases of COVID-19; however, at least 14 cases have been exported from Egypt to four countries.3\n\nThe burden of infection in Egypt, therefore, might be substantially larger than reported. We estimated the potential burden of COVID-19 in Egypt using the approach of Fraser and colleagues.4We investigated two scenarios: (1) all exported cases, considered to be independent (n=14); and (2) all exported cases minus travellers who had visited multiple countries and possibly linked cases (n=5). In the second scenario, linked cases included six cases exported to France, all of whom appeared to be from the same tour group and so were counted as a single case. Similarly, the two exported cases to the USA, a husband and wife, were counted as a single case, and five cases exported to Canada were counted as three cases because two cases were linked to a third case. One exported case to Taiwan also travelled to the United Arab Emirates, where COVID-19 has been reported, and so was not counted in the second scenario.\u2022 View related content for this articleWe used travel data from the International Air Transport Association, which accounts for over 90% of the world's travel flights and traveller volumes. In February, 2019, 829\u2008370 international air travellers departed from Egypt. The four countries reporting exported cases were ranked eighth (USA), 13th (France), 31st (Canada), and 40th (Taiwan) for travel volumes and together accounted for 5\u00b71% of outbound air travellers from Egypt. We used data from the UN World Tourism Organization on the average length of stay in Egypt by tourists (11\u00b76 days) and proportion of air travellers who are tourists rather than residents of Egypt (61%) and assumed that COVID-19 had been transmitting in Egypt from Feb 6 to March 6, 2020. Residents were assumed to have a 1-month exposure period. Under the conservative estimate of the COVID-19 burden, in which linked and ambiguous cases were eliminated (ie, scenario 2), we estimated an outbreak size of 19\u2008310 cases (95% CI 6270\u201345\u2008070) in Egypt. Using all cases, regardless of possible non-independence, we obtained a higher estimate of 51\u2008520 cases (28\u2008170\u201386\u2008440), but given reports that several Nile tour operators have COVID-19 infections, these values might overestimate the burden in Egypt if tourists are preferentially affected and exporting cases. Given this observation, we estimate that the true value is probably closer to the lower end of the CI in the conservative estimate, and probably near 6000 cases.Egypt probably has a large burden of COVID-19 cases that are unreported, and increased clinical capacity for public health might help identify and manage cases. Using the lower bound of our more conservative estimate, this estimate would still represent a substantially greater number of cases than has been officially reported in the country. Additionally, Egypt might be a source of COVID-19 exportation that is not yet accounted for by many public health initiatives.KK is the founder and CEO of BlueDot, a social benefit company that tracks emerging infectious diseases.

Undoubtedly, their work is important for clinical management of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia. However, from an epidemiological perspective, interpretation of CT for early identification of SARS-CoV-2 infection needs to be done with caution.First, the sensitivity and specificity of CT for screening and diagnosing SARS-CoV-2 infection are unknown. Shi and colleagues1\nreported that the CT findings of 14 (93%) of 15 preclinical patients had ground-glass opacification. However, this study did not include suspected cases that were SARS-CoV-2 negative. RT-PCR results\u2014the gold standard for diagnosing SARS-CoV-2 infection\u2014corresponding to the CT findings were also not reported. Thus, the concordance between CT findings and laboratory tests was unknown. Another study showed a contradictory finding that seven (37%) of 19 asymptomatic cases had positive RT-PCR results for SARS-CoV-2 in the absence of CT changes.2\nTherefore, we have adequate reason to doubt whether CT is suitable for screening asymptomatic infections.\u2022 View related content for this articleSecond, the use of CT for screening and diagnosing COVID-19 might have a disproportionate risk\u2013benefit ratio. Large-scale use of CT will increase radiation exposure of the population, which increases the probability of uncertain biological effects in the long term.3\nUse of CT might also increase the risk of cross-infection if disinfection is not properly implemented. Furthermore, studies have shown that the secondary attack rate among close contacts is 9\u00b76% (95% CI 7\u00b79\u201311\u00b78),4\nand asymptomatic patients account for only 1\u00b72% of total SARS-CoV-2 infections.5\n\nThese data show the little additional value CT screening has for early diagnosis of COVID-19.The feasibility of applying CT for early diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection needs more supportive evidence. We believe that use of CT in screening or early diagnosis in high-risk groups should balance risks and benefits to reduce radiation dose and potential disease burden. On the basis of current evidence and experience, we suggest that there should be clear criteria for the use of CT in diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. One criterion would be to have symptoms or signs of infection or to identify close contacts and have a positive nucleic acid screening test; another would be to treat or determine the course of the disease. Otherwise, CT should not be recommended for screening or early diagnosis.We declare no competing interests.

During the outbreak of COVID-19 in China in January, and February, 2020, timely diagnosis was a crucial step for infection control, especially in the epidemic area of Wuhan, Hubei province. However, RT-PCR kits were not sufficiently provided to hospitals in Wuhan until Jan 16, 2020. Before then, there was less capacity of kits to meet the rapidly increasing clinical demand. Furthermore, the total positive rate of RT-PCR for throat swab samples was reported to be less than 60%.2\nThe diagnostic sensitivity of viral pneumonia by chest radiography was relatively low,3\nwhereas CT had a high sensitivity for diagnosis of COVID-19, making it a potential primary tool for COVID-19 detection in epidemic areas.2\nAdditionally, according to the guideline for diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19 by the Chinese Ministry of Health (fifth trial edition),4\n\nclinically suspected cases in Hubei province were mainly those with imaging features consistent with pneumonia.We agree that there should be clear criteria for CT use in diagnosis of COVID-19. In fact, we do not recommend CT for screening or early diagnosis in all areas or for all populations. In our study, group 1 (preclinical) included health-care workers (ten nurses and five physicians) from two hospitals in Wuhan, who were on the frontline during the outbreak peak. All 15 participants had close contact with confirmed cases and willingly underwent CT scanning as a screening measure. Our Article retrospectively included this group, mainly to illustrate the imaging findings in the subclinical phase, which might also be incidentally found in patients who are imaged for other reasons. Based on this discovery in an epidemic area, we have proposed the potential role of CT in asymptomatic high-risk individuals with a history of exposure to COVID-19 patients in epidemic areas. Compared with another recent publication,5\nthe discrepancy in CT positive rates might be attributed to variable sample sizes, different demographic features, and potential retrospective selection bias.\u2022 View related content for this articleIn the epidemic area, all CT scans were done in accordance with strict infection control protocol to avoid cross-infection. We agree that use of CT for screening or diagnosis has a disproportionate risk\u2013benefit ratio.

Most coronaviruses cause diseases in their particular host species;1\nthose that can infect humans through cross-species transmission have become an important threat to public health. Two serious coronavirus disease outbreaks have happened in the past two decades: severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003,2\nand Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) in 2012.3Since December, 2019, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been recognised as the causal factor in a series of severe cases of pneumonia originating in Wuhan in Hubei province, China.4\nThis disease has been named coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) by WHO. SARS-CoV-2 has been shown to cause disease via a mechanism analogous to the SARS coronavirus, with potential damage to vital organs such as lung, heart, liver, and kidney, and infection poses a considerable risk to patients by the high prevalence of pneumonia.5\nBy March 1, 2020, SARS-CoV-2 had led to 80\u2008981 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in China, and 44\u2008067 cases in 117 countries.6\n\nA cohort study of 44\u2008672 Chinese cases reported that 2\u00b71% of patients were younger than 20 years, and 1\u00b72% were asymptomatic.7Pneumonia is the leading cause of mortality in children.8\nDistinct immunological responses to viral infections can exist in children and result in severe damage to vital organs.9\nAlthough short-to-medium-term outcomes for children who recovered from SARS seemed good, the disease caused exercise impairment after more than 6 months.10\nA comprehensive literature search indicated that MERS was rare in children (31 cases identified between 2012 and 2016),11\nbecause transmission depends heavily on animal exposure and direct contact in the household or health-care facilities. Collectively, these two coronavirus diseases did not widely affect children because of the short-term epidemic of SARS and the strict transmission route of MERS. In a study of 15 children with COVID-19 (aged 4\u201314 years), six patients had small nodular ground-glass opacities in the lungs.12\nAt the time of the COVID-19 outbreak, all schools were on the spring festival holiday, which might have prevented children from exposure to transmission sources. However, the school community is a place that can enhance rapid spread of the highly infectious SARS-CoV-2.Research in context\nEvidence before this study\nWe searched PubMed from Nov 1, 2019, to March 1, 2020, for studies published in any language using the terms \u201cCOVID-19\u201d, \u201ccoronavirus disease 2019\u201d, \u201cnovel coronavirus\u201d, \u201cpediatric patients\u201d, \u201cchildren\u201d, \u201ctransmission\u201d, \u201cclinical feature\u201d, and \u201cepidemiological features\u201d.

To our knowledge, no study has been done to comprehensively investigate a cohort of paediatric patients with COVID-19 and their distinctive clinical features. Published work about adult patients has shown that manifestations vary strikingly by individual. Since children are different from adults in many aspects, such as immunological development, we aimed to investigate the clinical and epidemiological features of paediatric patients with COVID-19.\nAdded value of this study\nBetween Jan 17 and March 1, 2020, 661 cases of COVID-19 were reported in Ningbo and Wenzhou (Zhejiang province, China). Of these cases, 36 were in children. All children with COVID-19 had been infected either by close contact with adults infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) or by exposure to the epidemic area. Although fever, cough, and pneumonia were the most common signs, about half the children had mild disease with no presenting symptoms. Fewer children with COVID-19 had obvious symptoms compared with adult patients with COVID-19 and paediatric patients with H1N1 influenza described in previous studies.\nImplications of all the available evidence\nBy contrast with findings in adults, children with COVID-19 had milder clinical manifestations; nearly half of paediatric patients were asymptomatic (ie, no fever and no cough). This asymptomatic condition is relevant if community-acquired transmission becomes the primary mode; identification of paediatric patients without presenting symptoms will become a great challenge. Fortunately, the number of children infected with SARS-CoV-2 accounted for a small proportion of total people infected, and paediatric patients also had clear epidemiological information.

We aimed to describe the epidemiological and clinical features of these paediatric patients, information that is urgently needed for prevention and treatment of COVID-19 in children.We did an observational cohort study at three hospitals in Zhejiang province, China (Ningbo Women and Children's Hospital, The Third Affiliated Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University, and Wenzhou Central Hospital of Wenzhou). We included all paediatric patients (aged 0\u201316 years) with laboratory confirmed COVID-19. The diagnosis of COVID-19 was based on guidelines issued by the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China.13\n\nWe screened all patients who had cough, fever, and radiographic presentation at the initial assessment, or who underwent epidemiological investigation because of a history of exposure to epidemic areas or close contact with an infected individual. We confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection by RT-PCR of samples taken from upper nasopharyngeal swabs. Epidemiological investigation was focused on the route of transmission, and we assessed travel history, residence in epidemic areas, and close contact with patients with confirmed COVID-19 within 14 days.This study was approved by the ethics committee of Ningbo Women and Children's Hospital and followed the Declaration of Helsinki.

Information retrieved included demographic data, medical history, exposure history, underlying comorbidities, symptoms, laboratory examinations, chest CT scans, and treatment. Laboratory examinations included routine testing, analysis of immunological responses, and measurement of biomarkers for monitoring lung, liver, myocardial, and renal functions. We compared the prevalence of abnormal clinical indices of the paediatric patients with previously reported data for 175 adults with COVID-19 in Wenzhou,17\n44 paediatric patients with SARS in Hong Kong,10\n,  18\nand 167 Chinese paediatric patients with H1N1 influenza.19We presented continuous variables as mean (SD) and categorical variables as number (%). We compared means of continuous variables between groups using independent group t tests when values were normally distributed; otherwise, we used the Mann-Whitney U test. We compared proportions for categorical variables between groups using Fisher's exact test, because of limited numbers. We judged a two-sided \u03b1 less than 0\u00b705 statistically significant. All data analyses were done with SPSS version 20.The funder had no role in study design, data collection, data analysis, data interpretation, or writing of the report. The corresponding author had full access to all data in the study and had final responsibility for the decision to submit for publication.Between Jan 17 and March 1, 2020, 661 COVID-19 cases were reported in Ningbo and Wenzhou in China; of these cases, 36 (5%) were in children (aged 1\u201316 years; mean age 8\u00b73 [3\u00b75] years). 13 (36%) of 36 patients were female (table 1). The route of transmission for paediatric patients was either by close contact with family members with COVID-19 (32 [89%]) or a history of exposure to epidemic areas (12 [33%]), or both (eight [22%]). 17 (47%) of 36 children had mild clinical type, with ten (28%) patients asymptomatic and seven (19%) showing acute upper respiratory symptoms. The remaining 19 (53%) paediatric patients had moderate clinical type, characteristic of mild pneumonia (table 1). No severe and critically ill cases were seen.\nTable 1Epidemiological and clinical features of paediatric patients with COVID-19 stratified by two clinical types\nTotal (n=36) Mild cases (n=17) Moderate cases (n=19) p value*\nEpidemiological data\nFemale patients 13 (36%) 7 (41%) 6 (32%) 0\u00b770\nMale patients 23 (64%) 10 (59%) 13 (68%) ..\nAge, years (SD, range) 8\u00b73 (3\u00b75, 1\u201316) 7\u00b75 (3\u00b72, 1\u201316) 9\u00b70 (3\u00b76, 3\u201316) 0\u00b7099\nAge \u22645 years 10 (28%) 8 (80%) 2 (20%) ..\nHistory of exposure to epidemic area 12 (33%) 5 (29%) 7 (37%) 0\u00b770\nFamily members with COVID-19 32 (89%) 16 (94%) 16 (84%) 0\u00b760\nSymptoms\nDry cough 7 (19%) 3 (18%) 4 (21%) ..\nDyspnoea or tachypnoea 1 (3%) .. 1 (5%) ..\nPharyngeal congestion 1 (3%) 1 (6%) .. ..\nSore throat 2 (6%) 1 (6%) 1 (5%) ..\nVomiting or diarrhoea 2 (6%) .. 2 (10%) ..\nBody temperature, \u00b0C 37\u00b78 (0\u00b74) 37\u00b76 (0\u00b73) 38\u00b70 (0\u00b74) 0\u00b70020\nFever (body temperature >37\u00b0C) 13 (36%) 4 (24%) 9 (47%) ..\nHeadache 3 (8%) 1 (6%) 2 (10%) ..\nLaboratory tests (reference values)\nWhite blood cells (4\u201310\u2008\u00d7\u2008109 cells per L) 6\u00b71 (2\u00b71) 6\u00b75 (2\u00b73) 5\u00b78 (1\u00b79) 0\u00b732\nDecreased (n) 7 2 5 ..\nLymphocytes (1\u00b71\u20133\u00b72\u2008\u00d7\u2008109 cells per L) 2\u00b74 (0\u00b78) 2\u00b78 (1\u00b70) 2\u00b70 (0\u00b77) 0\u00b70083\nDecreased (n) 11 2 9 ..\nProcalcitonin (<0\u00b75 ng/mL) 0\u00b724 (0\u00b717) 0\u00b715 (0\u00b713) 0\u00b732 (0\u00b719) 0\u00b70039\nIncreased (n) 6 1 5 ..\nC-reactive protein (<8 mg/L) 5 (2) 4 (1) 5 (2) 0\u00b7072\nIncreased (n) 1 0 1 ..\nD-dimer (<0\u00b75 \u03bcg/mL) 0\u00b729 (0\u00b720) 0\u00b721 (0\u00b718) 0\u00b736 (0\u00b721) 0\u00b7028\nIncreased (n) 3 1 2 ..\nErythrocyte sedimentation rate (0\u201320 mm/h) 7 (2) 6 (2) 7 (2) 0\u00b714\nIncreased (n) 0 0 0 ..\nCreatine kinase (55\u2013170 U/L) 96 (47) 80 (44) 110 (56) 0\u00b7085\nIncreased (n) 1 0 1\nCreatine kinase MB (<18 U/L) 19 (10) 14 (9) 24 (12) 0\u00b70084\nIncreased (n) 11 4 7 ..\nAlanine aminotransferase (<40 U/L) 21 (14) 21 (12) 20 (13) 0\u00b782\nIncreased (n) 2 2 0 ..\nAspartate transferase (<40 U/L) 30 (11) 32 (10) 28 (11) 0\u00b726\nIncreased (n) 3 2 1 ..\nCreatinine (40\u2013110 \u03bcmol/L) 56 (12) 58 (11) 54 (13) 0\u00b732\nIncreased (n) 0 0 0 ..\nBlood urea nitrogen (3\u20137 mmol/L) 3\u00b78 (0\u00b75) 3\u00b77 (0\u00b74) 3\u00b79 (0\u00b75) 0\u00b720\nIncreased (n) 0 0 0 ..\nOxygen saturation (92\u2013100%) 98\u00b71 (0\u00b74) 98\u00b72 (0\u00b73) 98 (0\u00b73) 0\u00b7054\nDecreased (n) 0 0 0 ..\nRadiography\nPulmonary ground-glass opacities 19 (53%) .. 19 (100%) ..\nTreatment\nOxygen inhalation 6 (17%) 1 (6%) 5 (26%) ..\nInterferon alfa 36 (100%) 17 (100%) 19 (100%) ..\nLopinavir\u2013ritonavir 14 (39%) 2 (12%) 12 (63%) ..\nTime taken to become SARS-CoV-2 PCR-negative, days (SD, range) 10 (2, 7\u201322) 9 (2, 7\u201312) 11 (2, 8\u201322) 0\u00b70050\nDuration of fever after admission, days (SD, range)\u2020\n3 (2, 2\u20135) 2 (2, 2\u20134) 3 (2, 2\u20135) 0\u00b714\nDuration of hospitalisation, days (SD, range) 14 (3, 10\u201320) 12 (3, 10\u201316) 15 (4, 12\u201320) 0\u00b7017\nData are n (%) or mean (SD), unless otherwise indicated.

Of 13 patients with fever, four (11%) had a body temperature of 38\u00b75\u00b0C or higher and nine (25%) had a body temperature of 37\u00b75\u201338\u00b75\u00b0C. Other symptoms were recorded infrequently, including sore throat (two [6%]), pharyngeal congestion (one [3%]), dyspnoea or tachypnoea (one [3%]), and vomiting or diarrhoea (two [6%]). Neither neurological symptoms nor signs of cardiac, liver, or renal failure were recorded.Generally, two types of abnormal radiographic presentations were seen: multiple opacities and patchy opacities. 19 (53%) paediatric patients had pulmonary ground-glass opacities on CT scan, suggesting pneumonia (figure 1). Pneumonia plus either fever or cough was seen in 11 (30%) paediatric patients and eight (22%) had pneumonia as the only symptom. Ten (28%) children showed no symptoms of pneumonia, five (14%) reported fever only, and two (5%) only had a dry cough.\nFigure 1Chest CT scans from two paediatric patients with coronavirus disease 2019\nShow full caption\nView Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Table 1 shows findings of laboratory examinations related to immunological responses and cardiac, liver, and renal damage, according to mild or moderate clinical type. Abnormal findings in paediatric patients were increased serum creatine kinase MB (11 [31%]), decreased lymphocytes (11 [31%]), leucopenia (seven [19%]), and increased procalcitonin (six [17%]). Some features differed significantly between mild and moderate clinical type of COVID-19, including decreased lymphocytes (p=0\u00b70083), raised body temperature (p=0\u00b70020), and high levels of procalcitonin (p=0\u00b70039), D-dimer (p=0\u00b7028), and creatine kinase MB (p=0\u00b70084). Children with moderate clinical type also had a positive PCR result for longer (p=0\u00b70050) and spent more days in hospital (p=0\u00b7017) than did those with mild clinical type.Table 2 shows findings of laboratory examinations related to immunological responses and cardiac, liver, and renal damage, according to age group. Ten patients were aged 5 years or younger and 26 patients were 16 years or younger but older than 5 years. The older children had decreased lymphocytes (p=0\u00b7029), elevated procalcitonin (p=0\u00b7032), and decreased creatine kinase (p=0\u00b7032) compared with the younger patients.\nTable 2Comparison of clinical features between paediatric patients, by age group\nAge 0 to \u22645 years (n=10) Age >5 to \u226416 years (n=26) p value\nEpidemiological data\nFemale patients 4 (40%) 9 (35%) ..\nMale patients 6 (60%) 17 (65%) ..\nHistory of exposure to epidemic area 2 (20%) 10 (38%) ..\nFamily members with COVID-19 10 (100%) 22 (85%) 0\u00b760\nSymptoms\nDry cough 1 (10%) 6 (23%) ..\nBody temperature, \u00b0C 37\u00b77 (0\u00b73) 37\u00b79 (0\u00b74) 0\u00b716\nFever (body temperature >37\u00b0C) 3 (30%) 10 (38%) ..\nRadiography\nPulmonary ground-glass opacities 6 (60%) 13 (50%) 0\u00b770\nLaboratory tests (reference values)\nWhite blood cells (4\u201310\u2008\u00d7\u2008109 cells per L) 6\u00b75 (2\u00b72) 5\u00b79 (2\u00b70) 0\u00b744\nDecreased (n) 2 5 ..\nLymphocytes (1\u00b71\u20133\u00b72\u2008\u00d7\u2008109 cells per L) 2\u00b79 (1\u00b71) 2\u00b72 (0\u00b77) 0\u00b7029\nDecreased (n) 2 9\nProcalcitonin (<0\u00b75 ng/mL) 0\u00b713 (0\u00b715) 0\u00b728 (0\u00b719) 0\u00b7032\nIncreased (n) 1 5 ..\nC-reactive protein (<8 mg/L) 4 (1) 5 (2) 0\u00b714\nIncreased (n) 0 1 ..\nD-dimer (<0\u00b75 \u03bcg/mL) 0\u00b720 (0\u00b718) 0\u00b732 (0\u00b720) 0\u00b711\nIncreased (n) 0 3 ..\nCreatine kinase (55\u2013170 U/L) 124 (54) 85 (44) 0\u00b7032\nIncreased (n) 1 0 ..\nCreatine kinase MB (<18 U/L) 21 (14) 18 (7) 0\u00b740\nIncreased (n) 5 6 ..\nOxygen saturation (92\u2013100%) 98\u00b72 (0\u00b73) 98\u00b71 (0\u00b73) 0\u00b738\nDecreased (n) 0 0 ..\nMild cases 4 (40%) 13 (50%) 0\u00b770\nTherapy and outcomes\nOxygen inhalation 1 (10%) 5 (19%) ..\nInterferon alfa 10 (100%) 26 (100%) >0\u00b799\nLopinavir\u2013ritonavir 1 (10%) 13 (50%) ..\nTime taken to become SARS-CoV-2 PCR-negative, days (SD, range) 9 (2, 7\u201314) 11 (2, 8\u201322) 0\u00b7011\nDuration of hospitalisation, days (SD, range) 13 (3, 10\u201318) 15 (4, 13\u201320) 0\u00b716\nData are n (%) or mean (SD), unless otherwise indicated.

On admission, all children were treated with interferon alfa by aerosolisation twice a day, 14 (39%) received lopinavir\u2013ritonavir syrup twice a day, and six (17%) needed oxygen inhalation (table 1). In the 13 patients with fever, mean duration of fever was 3 (SD 2) days. Improvement in pneumonia was seen 4\u201310 days after treatment initiation. SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR results became negative after a mean of 10 (SD 2) days of treatment, regardless of the various initial manifestations of patients (figure 2). The mean number of days in hospital was 14 (SD 3) days. By Feb 28, 2020, all patients were cured, according to the criteria for cured outcome, and quarantined for a further 2 weeks. Follow-up is continuing every week, with samples taken to measure serum IgG and IgM and SARS-CoV-2 in blood, faeces, and nasopharyngeal swabs.\nFigure 2Trajectory of COVID-19 disease progression and treatment in four paediatric patients with different manifestations\nShow full caption\nView Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The comparison of paediatric patients with COVID-19 with adult patients with COVID-19 in the same city (table 3) showed that paediatric patients had a significantly lower prevalence of abnormal values of several variables indicating disease severity, such as fever (36% for children and 86% for adults), cough (19% and 62%), pneumonia (53% and 95%), elevated C-reactive protein (3% and 49%), and severe disease type (0% and 23%; p<0\u00b70001 for all features). Nevertheless, no differences were noted between children and adults in prevalence of leucopenia, lymphopenia, and elevated myocardial enzymes. When compared with children with SARS, paediatric patients with COVID-19 had much milder disease in terms of the prevalence of fever, cough, pneumonia, and severe case type. Compared with children with H1N1 influenza, paediatric patients with COVID-19 had fewer upper respiratory symptoms (eg, cough and pharyngeal congestion) but pneumonia was more frequent. Notably, when the three groups of patients with coronavirus infections were compared with the paediatric patients with H1N1 influenza, the most striking difference was that patients with H1N1 influenza had a much higher prevalence of pharyngeal congestion and a lower prevalence of pneumonia.\nTable 3Comparison of prevalence of clinical features between children with COVID-19, adults with COVID-19, children with H1N1 influenza, and children with SARS\nChildren with COVID-19 (n=36) Adults with COVID-19 (n=175)17\nChildren with SARS (n=44)10\nChildren with H1N1 influenza (n=167)19\nAge, years 8\u00b73 (3\u00b75) 45 (14) 12\u00b72 (4\u00b71) 4\u00b71 (3\u00b75)\nFever 13 (36%) 150 (86%) 44 (100%) 153 (92%)\nCough 7 (19%) 109 (62%) 28 (64%) 138 (83%)\nPharyngeal congestion or sore throat 1 (3%) 8 (5%) 6 (14%) 159 (95%)\nDyspnoea 1 (3%) 23 (13%) 4 (9%) 12 (7%)\nAsymptomatic*\n10 (28%) <5% 0 <5%\nPneumonia 19 (53%) 166 (95%) 40/62 (65%)\u2020\n18 (11%)\nComorbidities or complications (except pneumonia and bronchitis) 0 10 (6%) 5 (11%) 7 (4%)\nMild and moderate cases 36 (100%) 136 (77%) 35 (79%) 135 (81%)\nSevere cases 0 39 (23%) 9 (21%) 32 (19%)\nLeucopenia 7 (19%) 44 (25%) 15 (34%) 65 (39%)\nLymphopenia 11 (31%) 61 (35%) 34 (77%) NA\nMyocardial enzymes elevated 11 (31%) 39 (22%) 3 (7%) 18 (11%)\nLiver enzymes elevated 2 (6%) 32 (18%) 21 (48%) 12 (7%)\nElevated C-reactive protein 1 (3%) 86 (49%) NA 42 (25%)\nAntiviral therapy 14 (39%) 170 (97%) 42 (96%) 167 (100%)\nData are n (%) or mean (SD).

NA=not available.SARS-CoV-2 is an emerging contagious pathogen causing a high prevalence of pneumonia in infected individuals. Understanding the clinical features in paediatric patients is important for diagnosis and effective treatment of this illness. The findings of our study show that the main clinical features of COVID-19 in children were fever, dry cough, and pneumonia. Paediatric patients acquired COVID-19 by clear transmission routes, including close contact with family members, a history of exposure to epidemic areas, or both of these. No other sources, such as a hospital stay or unclear routes of transmission, were identified. This transmission feature means that identification of these paediatric patients was straightforward. However, previous work has shown that potential transmission routes of SARS-CoV-2 can be highly variable,20\ncompared with MERS coronavirus, which is less transmissible.11\nThis situation could be altered if COVID-19 persists for a long time in an area with increased risk for community-acquired infections.Among the paediatric patients in our study, just under a third were asymptomatic. Moreover, a fifth had pneumonia only and needed radiographic examination to be identified. Symptoms seen on admission were variable, including cough and fever. All asymptomatic patients and children who did not present with pneumonia needed laboratory and radiographic examinations for diagnosis. The large proportion of children with asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection contrasts with paediatric patients with H1N1 influenza19\nand SARS,10\nand adult patients with COVID-19,17\nin terms of presenting symptoms such as cough and pharyngeal congestion (table 3), indicating SARS-CoV-2 has little effect on the upper respiratory tract of children. COVID-19 is highly transmissible, similar to SARS and H1N1 influenza, but can have a covert presentation in children.Pneumonia is the leading infectious cause of death in children younger than 5 years.21\nAlthough COVID-19 in children seemed to be mild in term of presenting symptoms, the prevalence of pneumonia with COVID-19 (53%) was higher than with H1N1 influenza (11%), but very similar to the prevalence with SARS (65%).18\nA striking characteristic of COVID-19 is that it affects several vital organs (eg, lungs and heart), as shown by increased amounts of myocardial enzymes, even though all children with COVID-19 had the mild or moderate clinical type (table 3). With high mortality in adult patients with COVID-19 in epidemic areas6\n\n(eg, >4% mortality in Wuhan), paediatric patients should continue to be monitored after discharge from hospital.Compared with adults, children rarely have comorbidities such as hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes. Paediatric patients in our study had a lower prevalence of pneumonia and symptoms such as fever, cough, and dyspnoea compared with adult patients with COVID-19 (table 3). However, in our study, the prevalence of leucopenia, lymphopenia, and increased myocardial enzymes in children with COVID-19 was similar to that in adults. Notably, adults have a much higher prevalence of increased C-reactive protein than do children, suggesting a much milder immunological response in children and less immune damage.22\nExcept for antiviral drugs, no special treatments (eg, glucocorticoid therapy and invasive mechanical ventilation) were administered, and few children needed inhaled oxygen. Taking all these findings into consideration, the presentation of COVID-19 in paediatric patients is much milder than in adults. It is noteworthy that few patients with coronavirus disease (ie, COVID-19 and SARS) have pharyngeal congestion or sore throat, which contrasts with patients with H1N1 influenza, despite the high prevalence of cough and fever in all patients. Pharyngeal congestion is more like an upper respiratory symptom than is fever (which is a systemic symptom) and cough, which can also be induced by a lower respiratory infection.The findings of our study also showed that, although all paediatric cases were mild or moderate, the number of days spent in hospital and time needed for these patients to have negative PCR results was still considerable (table 1, figure 2). The time to achieve a negative PCR result seemed to be unaffected by severity of disease in terms of symptoms and the presence of pneumonia and treatment choices. Nevertheless, fever resolved faster in mild cases than in moderate cases (figure 2). Considering that delayed clearance of viral RNA in patients' stools is a potential risk for transmission,23\nparticularly in patients in rehabilitation, the reliability of viral RNA-negative criteria in asymptomatic patients, in the long run, needs further investigation.The major limitation of our study was the small sample size. However, most results were consistent within the study and, with several case reports on children with COVID-19, we believe our conclusions are valid. Since COVID-19 is spreading in more countries and has become an urgent public health event, we present an early report on paediatric patients and expect additional data to improve our findings.In conclusion, our study shows that paediatric patients with COVID-19 have a simple transmission mode, either by close contact with infected adults or by exposure to epidemic areas. Although fever, dry cough, and mild pneumonia are common manifestations, nearly half of patients have neither obvious symptoms nor abnormal radiological findings. The proportion of asymptomatic cases indicates the difficulty in identifying paediatric patients without clear epidemiological information. This finding suggests a dangerous situation if community-acquired infections occur.ContributorsHQ and JW designed the study and did the literature search.

Common symptoms reported in adults with COVID-19 are fever, dry cough, and fatigue; severe cases have been associated with dyspnoea and bilateral ground-glass opacities on chest CT.3\nIn China, the SARS-CoV-2 reproductive number is estimated at 2.6\nThe combined case-fatality rate is 2% in China,7\nand the risk of death is increased significantly in older people (approximately 15%).7\nIt is noteworthy that infants and children have not been featured prominently in COVID-19 case statistics. An analysis from China has shown that children younger than 10 years account for only 1% of COVID-19 cases,7\nsimilar to the proportion for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV epidemics.4\n,  5Infants and young children are typically at high risk for admission to hospital after respiratory tract infection with viruses such as respiratory syncytial virus and influenza virus.8\nImmaturity of the respiratory tract and immune system is thought to contribute to severe viral respiratory disease in this age group.8\nTherefore, the absence of paediatric patients with COVID-19 has perplexed clinicians, epidemiologists, and scientists. Case definitions and management strategies for children are absent because of the limited number of paediatric patients with COVID-19. In The Lancet Infectious Diseases, Haiyan Qiu and colleagues9\nhave shed light on this under-represented population with a clinical report of 36 paediatric patients (aged 1\u201316 years) with PCR-confirmed COVID-19. Their analyses have important implications for clinical management of younger people with SARS-CoV-2 infection and social distancing policies to prevent virus transmission.\u2022 View related content for this articleThe patients in this study9\nwere being treated at three hospitals located in Zhejiang province, China, which is 900 km from Wuhan. The children accounted for roughly 5% of total patients with COVID-19. Patients were stratified by disease severity and were assessed in hospital (mean duration of hospitalisation, 14 [SD 3] days) for secondary bacterial and fungal infection, sepsis, immune responses, and organ dysfunction (lung, liver, heart, and kidney). All children underwent CT examination for diagnosis of pneumonia.Ten (28%) patients were asymptomatic latent cases identified because either an adult family member had the infection or they had been exposed to the epidemic area.9\nContact tracing was also used to identify paediatric infections during the SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV epidemics.4\n,  5\nNone of the children developed severe illness or died, similar to findings of SARS-CoV paediatric cases in 2002\u201303.4\nThe most commonly reported clinical finding in children with COVID-19 was pneumonia (19 [53%]); fever, dry cough, or both were the next most frequent symptoms. All children with COVID-19 were aggressively treated, which was also standard for children with SARS-CoV infection.4\nTreatment for COVID-19 consisted of aerosolised interferon alfa in all children, lopinavir\u2013ritonavir syrup twice a day for 14 days in 14 (39%), and supplemental oxygen for six (17%). Paediatric patients were discharged after two negative SARS-CoV-2 PCRs.Qiu and colleagues have done a very important preliminary study defining the clinical picture for children infected with SARS-CoV-2, which will be valued globally. Although this work will assist with case identification, management, and social policy guidance, much more information is needed to establish the optimum management regimen. Specifically, the data showed that paediatric patients with COVID-19 had mild or asymptomatic disease accompanied by pneumonia in about half the cases.9\nIt is unclear which children should be targeted for antiviral and immunomodulatory treatment, particularly in view of the high proportion of asymptomatic infected contacts. Together, these results could suggest that children have specific mechanisms regulating the interaction between the immune system and respiratory machinery, which could be contributing to milder disease. Possibly, lung infiltrates have a protective role during paediatric SARS-CoV-2 infection, similar to lymphocytes participating in inducible bronchus-associated lymphoid structure development after respiratory insult.10\nCorrelation between chest radiography and CT findings might give additional insight into the clinical importance, if any, of the CT findings. In view of the substantial radiation exposure associated with CT, if children are only experiencing mild disease, routine use of CT might not be warranted and needs further assessment for the management of paediatric cases.The most important finding to come from the present analysis is the clear evidence that children are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection, but frequently do not have notable disease, raising the possibility that children could be facilitators of viral transmission. If children are important in viral transmission and amplification, social and public health policies (eg, avoiding interaction with elderly people) could be established to slow transmission and protect vulnerable populations. There is an urgent need to for further investigation of the role children have in the chain of transmission.View Large Image\nCopyright \u00a9 2020 iStock/yaoinloveAAK and SH are funded by the Canadian Institutes for Health Research Rapid Response Grant for COVID-19.", "S1473-30992030176-6": "Background\nIn December, 2019, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in Wuhan, China.

Up to now, seven liveborn infants have been delivered by pregnant women with COVID-19 at Tongji Hospital (Wuhan, China). We aim to describe epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics, treatment, and maternal and fetal outcomes of full-term pregnant women confirmed to have SARS-CoV-2 infection.For this retrospective, single-centre study, we recruited patients from Jan 1 to Feb 8, 2020, at Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology (Wuhan, China). According to the arrangements put in place by the Chinese Government, pregnant women were admitted centrally to the hospital from all of Wuhan without selectivity. All pregnant women in Tongji Hospital who were diagnosed with COVID-19 according to the WHO interim guidance were enrolled in this study.4\n\nAmong them, three patients were directly admitted to Tongji hospital for fever and four patients were transferred from other hospitals across Wuhan. This study was approved by the ethics committee of Tongji Hospital, and written informed consent was obtained from the patients for the publication of individual data from before enrolment when data were collected retrospectively.Research in context\nEvidence before this study\nWe searched PubMed and Google Scholar on Feb 8, 2020, for articles describing the features of patients in pregnancy infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2; previously known as 2019 novel coronavirus [2019-nCoV]), using the search terms \u201cnovel coronavirus\u201d or \u201c2019 novel coronavirus\u201d or \u201c2019-nCoV\u201d and \u201cpregnancy\u201d or \u201cmaternal infection\u201d or \u201cneonatal outcomes\u201d. We also searched the China National Knowledge Infrastructure database and Wanfang Data using the same terms in Chinese. We found several epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, management, and outcomes studies regarding the epidemiology and clinical features of pneumonia caused by SARS-CoV-2. We identified no reports on management of pregnant women with COVID-19 and scarce evidence of mother-to-child vertical transmission.\nAdded value of this study\nWe assessed the incubation period, clinical manifestations, laboratory findings, chest CT scans, maternal and fetal management, therapeutic schedule, and maternal and fetal outcomes of full-term pregnant women confirmed to have COVID-19 pneumonia caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection. With intensive, active management, the outcomes of the pregnant women and neonates were good. Although one neonate was found to be infected with SARS-CoV-2 36 h postpartum, up to the follow-up day, no pneumonia and other clinical symptoms and signs were found in all seven neonates. To the best of our knowledge, we provide the first evidence that clinical features of COVID-19 in full-term pregnant women were similar to those of non-pregnant adult patients with COVID-19 and outcomes were good following intensive active management of the disease.\nImplications of all the available evidence\nThe outcomes observed in late pregnancy appear very good In light of all the evidence and we suggest that intensive, active management might be best practice in the absence of more robust data.Evidence before this studyWe searched PubMed and Google Scholar on Feb 8, 2020, for articles describing the features of patients in pregnancy infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2; previously known as 2019 novel coronavirus [2019-nCoV]), using the search terms \u201cnovel coronavirus\u201d or \u201c2019 novel coronavirus\u201d or \u201c2019-nCoV\u201d and \u201cpregnancy\u201d or \u201cmaternal infection\u201d or \u201cneonatal outcomes\u201d.

The incubation period was defined as the interval between the potential earliest date of contact of the transmission source (wildlife or person with suspected or confirmed case) and the potential earliest date of symptom onset (ie, cough, fever, fatigue, or myalgia). If data were missing from the records or clarification was needed, data were obtained by direct communication with attending doctors and other healthcare providers. All data were checked by two physicians (WL and NY).Laboratory confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 infection was done at Tongji Hospital. Throatswab specimens from the upper respiratory tract that were obtained from all patients at admission were maintained in viral transport medium. SARS-CoV-2 infection was confirmed by realtime RT-PCR using the same protocol as described previously.3\nReal-time RT-PCR detection reagents were provided by Tongji Hospital. Other respiratory viruses, including influenza A virus, influenza B virus, respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza virus, and adenovirus were also tested for by realtime RT-PCR. Sputum or endotracheal aspirates were obtained at admission for the identification of possible causative bacteria or fungi. Additionally, all patients were given chest CT examinations. All the patients delivered infants by caesarean section, and then the neonates were transferred to the neonatology department.We describe epidemiological data, demographics, signs and symptoms on admission, comorbidities, laboratory results, coinfection with other respiratory pathogens, chest radiography and CT findings, treatment received for COVID-19, and clinical maternal, fetal, and neonatal outcomes.Statistical analysis was done using SPSS, version 20.0.

All patients received antiviral treatment, including oseltamivir (75 mg every 12 h, orally), ganciclovir (0\u00b725 g every 12 h, intravenously), and interferon (40 \u03bcg daily, atomisation inhalation) and arbidol tablets (200 mg three times daily, orally; appendix 2 p 2). Traditional Chinese medicines, such as Jinyebaidu granules and Lianhuaqingwen capsules, were also given. All patients were given antibiotic treatment: two (29%) patients were treated with a single antibiotic and five (71%) patients were given combination therapy. The antibiotics used were cephalosporins, quinolones, and macrolides. Five (71%) patients were also treated with methylprednisolone after caesarean section (appendix 2 p 2).All the patients had caesarean section after consultation with a multidisciplinary team. The time of delivery was from 37 weeks to 41 weeks plus 5 days, with a mean of 39 weeks plus 2 days (appendix 2 p 3). Regarding anaesthesia, six patients had combined spinal and epidural anaesthesia and one received general anaesthesia. Intraoperative oxygen saturation was maintained at a minimum of 98%, mean intraoperative infusion volume was 1036 mL (range 500\u20131500 mL), mean intraoperative bleeding volume was 193 mL (50\u2013300 mL), and mean oxytocin use was 26 units (20\u201330 units).The outcomes of the pregnant women were good. There were no intesive care unit admissions for mothers throughout the study period, including before and after delivery. At the end of follow-up (March 12, 2020), all patients had been discharged from the hospital per the following discharge criteria: body temperature returned to normal for more than 3 days; respiratory symptoms improved significantly; pulmonary imaging showed a significant improvement in acute exudative lesions; and nucleic acid test of respiratory specimens such as results of sputum and nasopharyngeal swabs were negative twice in a row (sampling interval \u226524 h). The neonatal birthweights and Apgar scores were normal. Four infants were taken home and were not tested for SARS-CoV-2; no fever, pathological jaundice, or other symptoms were reported during the follow-up call at 28 days after birth. Another three infants remained for observation in the neonatology department and were tested for SARS-CoV-2. Nucleic acid test for the throat swab of one neonate (child of patient 1) was positive at 36 h after birth; nucleic acid tests for the other two were negative. Subsequently, this infected neonate was transferred to Wuhan Children's Hospital, a designated hospital for children infected with COVID-19. After admission, the neonate had no fever and cough, with mild shortness of breath symptoms. Chest x-ray revealed mild pulmonary infection. The shortness of breath relieved quickly under neonatal care and monitoring. The neonate was discharged after 2 weeks following two consecutive negative nucleic acid test results. At 28 days after birth, the remaining three neonates were healthy and had no respiratory symptoms or fever (table 2).\nTable 2Maternal and neonatal outcomes of seven patients with COVID-19\nPatient 1 Patient 2 Patient 3 Patient 4 Patient 5 Patient 6 Patient 7\nPregnancy outcome Discharged Discharged Discharged Discharged Discharged Discharged Discharged\nNeonatal outcome Normal Normal Normal Normal Normal Normal Normal\nBirthweight, g 3250 3350 3200 3000 3500 3300 3250\nApgar score (1 min) 8\u20139 8\u20139 8\u20139 8\u20139 8\u20139 8\u20139 8\u20139\nApgar score (5 min) 9\u201310 9\u201310 9\u201310 9\u201310 9\u201310 9\u201310 9\u201310\nAdmission to neonatology department Yes No Yes No No No Yes\nNucleic acid test of SARS-CoV-2 Positive (36 h) Not tested Negative Not tested Not tested Not tested Negative\nDays of follow-up 40 28 28 28 28 28 28\nNeonatal complications No No No No No No No\nNone of the women were admitted to intensive care.

SARS-CoV-2=severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2.This is a descriptive study on the clinical characteristics and obstetric and neonatal outcomes of pregnant women infected with COVID-19. At present, few cases of infected pregnant women have been reported. This study is one of the first to report the maternal, fetal, and neonatal outcomes of pregnant women with COVID-19 who are in their third trimesters. We have presented seven cases of COVID-19 in late pregnancy with good outcomes for both mother and infant.Human coronaviruses are among the most common pathogens that cause respiratory infection. SARS-CoV-2 has enveloped virions that measure about 50\u2013200 nm in diameter with a single positive-sense RNA genome.11\nCOVID-19 is transmitted through respiratory droplets, physical contact, and aerosols, and there is evidence of human-to-human transmission.12\n\n,  13\nNone of our pregnant patients had a history of exposure to Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, but all of them lived in the epidemic area. In terms of clinical manifestations, the common symptoms of these pregnant women at the onset of COVID-19 were fever and cough, and the less common symptoms were diarrhoea and shortness of breath. Laboratory tests showed that absolute lymphocyte counts were reduced, C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and D-dimer were increased, and leucocytes were normal in most of the seven pregnant patients. In our study, these patients showed a pattern of clinical characteristics similar to those reported in non-pregnant adults with COVID-19.Because COVID-19 is an emerging infectious disease, the optimal treatment for affected individuals has not yet been established. In our study, most patients were treated with ribavirin, corticosteroids, and antibiotics. Although remdesivir and other antiviral drugs have been used in the clinical treatment of patients with COVID-19, no data of their safety and efficacy as COVID-19 treatments have been published. No safety concerns have been identified related to the use of traditional Chinese medicine in our study. Five of our patients were treated with steroids (methylprednisolone 1\u20132 mg/kg per day); however, animal studies have shown that the use of large doses of corticosteroids during pregnancy might lead to fetal malformation, and some studies have shown that the easy passage of corticosteroids through the placenta might increase the incidence of low birthweight in infants.14\nTherefore, steroids were only used after caesarean section in this study. Thus far, no complications related to the steroids have been recorded in the mothers and infants, but their safety still needs more data to draw conclusions. Because of alterations in hormone levels and decreased lung volumes caused by increases in uterus size during pregnancy, patients might have a more rapid clinical deterioration. Additionally, the influence of the virus itself and these antivirals and Chinese medicines on fetal development is unknown. Therefore, for full-term pregnant women, after consultation with a multidisciplinary team, delivering as soon as possible might be a better choice for the sake of safety considerations. Timely use of antibiotics to prevent secondary bacterial infections and strengthen immune support treatment can reduce complications and mortality, so antibiotics were used routinely after operation.15\nCOVID-19 pneumonia in pregnancy is a complicated clinical scenario, and a multidisciplinary team of medical personnel is needed to care for and treat these patients comprehensively. Relevant specialty areas include obstetrics, infectious diseases, internal medicine, paediatrics, anaesthesia, psychology, and infection control. No medical staff had SARS-Cov-2 infections during the whole treatment period.The sequence similarity between SARS and SARS-CoV-2 is as high as 79%;16\nthe mortality rate of SARS infection is 10%,17\n\nand the mortality rate of SARS in pregnant women was 25%.18\nStudies have reported that the mortality rate of patients with COVID-19 is about 1\u00b74%.19\nIn our study, the maternal, fetal, and neonatal outcomes of pregnant women with COVID-19 pneumonia are better than those with SARS infection. This might be associated with our small number of cases and short delivery time (ie, as soon as possible after diagnosis). Previous studies have shown no evidence of perinatal SARS infection in infants born to mothers who had SARS infection during pregnancy.18\n,  20\nOne neonate in our study was infected with COVID-19 36 h after birth. However, the viral nucleic acid tests of the placenta and cord blood in this patient were negative for SARS-CoV-2, so intrauterine vertical transmission might not have occurred; thus, further study is needed.However, this study has several limitations. First, only seven pregnant women with COVID-19 were included in the analyses. More infected pregnant women and comparative studies (eg, cohorts, case-control) should be analysed to get a more comprehensive understanding of COVID-19 in pregnancy. Second, all enrolled patients were in the third trimester, so the effect of the virus infection on the fetus in the first or second trimester is unknown. Third, due to the short time of the outbreak, the long-term outcomes of the neonates and whether mother-to-child transmission exists require further study. However, the data in this study permit an early assessment of the clinical characteristics and maternal and fetal outcomes of COVID-19 in late pregnancy in women in Wuhan, China.In conclusion, the clinical characteristics of these patients with COVID-19 during late pregnancy are similar to those reported by non-pregnant adults with COVID-19. The maternal, fetal, and neonatal outcomes of those pregnant women infected in late pregnancy appear very good, and these outcomes are achieved with intensive, active management, which might be the best practice in absence of more robust data. Long-term outcomes and potential mother-to-child vertical transmission needs further study.ContributorsAll authors had full access to all the data in the study and take responsibility for the integrity of the data and the accuracy of the data analysis.

By March 10, 2020, 116\u2008166 cases have been reported globally, causing 4088 deaths. The epidemic has spread to 118 countries around the world.2With immunocompromised status and physiological adaptive changes during pregnancy, pregnant women could be more susceptible to COVID-19 infection than the general population. As COVID-19 is rapidly spreading, maternal management and fetal safety become a major concern, but there is scarce information of assessment and management of pregnant women infected with COVID-19, and the potential risk of vertical transmission is unclear. In The Lancet Infectious Diseases, Nan Yu and colleagues3\nreport the clinical features and obstetric and neonatal outcomes of pregnancy with COVID-19 pneumonia in Wuhan, China. Seven pregnant women with COVID-19 pneumonia were assessed and the onset symptoms were similar to those reported in non-pregnant adults with COVID-19. All patients received oxygen therapy and antiviral treatment in isolation. All patients had caesarean section after consultation with a multidisciplinary team and the outcomes of the pregnant women and neonates were good. Three neonates were tested for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), and one was found to be infected with COVID-19 36 h after birth. The findings of the study provide some indications for clinical assessment and management of pregnant women with COVID-19, but questions remain on how to manage pregnant women infected with COVID-19.\u2022 View related content for this articleAs Yu and colleagues3\nreported, five pregnant women were treated with steroids after caesarean section. Two were also treated with traditional Chinese medicine. However, no reliable evidence recommends any specific COVID-19 treatment for pregnant women. WHO guidance and some clinical evidence does not recommend the use of corticosteroids for COVID-19.4\n\n,  5\nUse of drugs in pregnant women needs to be on the basis of solid evidence. Clinical trials are needed to prove the effectiveness of drugs and the effects on the fetus to establish a standardised treatment for pregnant women with COVID-19. More evidence of the safety of traditional Chinese medicine is also warranted.The time of delivery in the study was 37 weeks to 41 weeks plus 5 days, all by caesarean section. In cases of pregnant women with COVID-19, more evidence is needed to establish when to deliver and when caesarean sections should be recommended. Previous treatment experience has been inconclusive about which delivery method is safer in this patient population. Zhu and colleagues6\nreported nine pregnant women with COVID-19. Seven of the women delivered their babies by cesarean section and two by vaginal delivery. All three neonates delivered vaginally (including two who were twins) had an Apgar score of at least 9 and negative nucleic acid test. Yudin and colleagues7\nreported a pregnant woman with SARS at 31 weeks of gestation; the patient stayed for 21 days in the hospital and did not require intensive care admission or ventilatory support, and a healthy baby girl was delivered by vaginal birth. It is unknown whether vaginal delivery increases the infection risk. Further research is needed to assess the risk and to produce guidelines for delivery times and methods in patients with COVID-19.As discussed in the study, although all mothers and infants showed good outcomes, all enrolled pregnant women were in the third trimester, and all had only mild symptoms. Hence, the effect of SARS-CoV-2 infection on the fetus in the first or second trimester or in patients with moderate to severe infection is unknown. As a previous study reported, SARS coronavirus infection during pregnancy might cause preterm birth, intrauterine growth restriction, intrauterine death, and neonatal death.8\nConsidering that the potential of SARS-CoV-2 to cause severe obstetric and neonatal adverse outcomes is unknown, rigorous screening of suspected cases during pregnancy and long-term follow-up of confirmed mothers and their neonates are needed.In the study by Yu and colleagues,3\nthree neonates were tested for SARS-CoV-2, of whom two were negative. One neonate was positive, but the viral nucleic acid tests of the placenta and cord blood in this case were negative. At the end of follow-up, no pneumonia and other clinical symptoms and signs were reported in any of the seven neonates. No reliable evidence has been provided in support of the possibility of vertical transmission of COVID-19 infection from mother to baby. The outcomes are consistent with previous reports.9\n,  10\nBut all these studies only assessed a small number of cases. Future studies should include a larger number of samples across multiple centres to establish whether vertical transmission can occur between mother and child.Yu and colleagues'3\nreport of the clinical features and obstetric and neonatal outcomes of pregnant women with COVID-19 provides a reference for clinical assessment and management of this patient population. However, understanding of SARS-CoV-2, especially the effect on pregnant women and neonates, is still insufficient. We need to further strengthen research to provide an evidence-based foundation for the medical management of pregnant patients with COVID-19.View Large Image\nCopyright \u00a9 2020 iStockphotoWe declare no competing interests. We provided the management and follow-up information for the neonate positive for SARS-CoV-2 described in the paper by Yu and colleagues; we were not involved in the management of the pregnant women described in the paper.", "S1473-30992030235-8": "Since December, 2019, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has affected more than 100\u2008000 patients globally.1\n\nCOVID-19 is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and has a case-fatality rate of 2\u00b73%, with higher rates among elderly patients and patients with comorbidities.2\nPerson-to-person transmission is efficient, with multiple clusters reported. Clinically, patients with COVID-19 present with respiratory symptoms, which is very similar to the presentation of other respiratory virus infections. Radiologically, COVID-19 is characterised by multifocal ground-glass opacities, even for patients with mild disease.3Knowledge of virus dynamics and host response are essential for formulating strategies for antiviral treatment, vaccination, and epidemiological control of COVID-19. However, a systematic study on these aspects has not been done. In The Lancet Infectious Diseases, Kelvin To and colleagues4\nreport the viral load and antibody profiles of a cohort of 23 patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19. In these patients, the viral load peaked during the first week of illness then gradually declined over the second week. Viral load was also shown to correlate with age. Furthermore, both IgG and IgM antibodies started to increase on around day 10 after symptom onset, and most patients had seroconversion within the first 3 weeks. Finally, the IgG and IgM antibody level against the SARS-CoV-2 internal nucleoprotein and the surface spike receptor binding domain correlated with neutralising activity.\u2022 View related content for this articleThese findings have several practical implications. First, the high viral load during the early phase of illness suggests that patients could be most infectious during this period, and it might account for the high transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2. Furthermore, the high viral load on presentation suggests that SARS-CoV-2 could be susceptible to emergence of antiviral resistance. Second, age was associated with viral load in this study, which could explain the high degree of severe disease in older patients with SARS-CoV-2.5\n,  6\nThe high viral load in elderly patients is associated not only with low immunity but also with high expression of the ACE2 receptor (the cell-entry receptor for SARS-CoV-2) in older adults.7\nThe timing of antibody seroconversion is crucial for determining the optimum timepoints for collecting serum specimens for antibody testing for diagnosis. Furthermore, this information is important for immunologists to choose the best timepoints for obtaining peripheral blood B cells for development of therapeutic monoclonal antibodies.8The major strength of the study by To and colleagues is the systematic analysis of the serial viral load and antibody profile for up to 4 weeks, which provides insights into viral and host interactions during the acute and convalescent phases. Another notable aspect is that self-collected posterior oropharyngeal saliva samples were used, instead of nasopharyngeal specimens, for viral load monitoring. Collection of nasopharyngeal specimens is an invasive procedure, and it is uncomfortable for the patient and poses an infection risk to health-care workers. Self-collected saliva is much more acceptable to patients and is safer for health-care workers. This study clearly shows the feasibility of using saliva for viral load monitoring.The information provided by To and colleagues is solid scientific evidence on COVID-19 for clinicians and scientists. Nonetheless, many questions are still outstanding on the viral characteristics and host response during infection. SARS-CoV-2 has been detected in faeces, blood, and urine samples,9\n,  10\nand it is important to ascertain viral load dynamics in such samples, for prevention and control of the pandemic. Furthermore, the relation between viral load and disease severity needs to be further clarified. Studies with a larger sample size are needed to understand how different factors can affect viral load or antibody response. For example, immunocompromised patients might have higher viral load, prolonged viral shedding, and impaired antibody response. Future studies in the paediatric population are vital, because children seem to have much milder disease than in adults. Finally, a more detailed understanding of the innate and adaptive immune response against SARS-CoV-2 is important for understanding the pathogenesis and for designing vaccines.View Large Image\nCopyright \u00a9 2020 Flickr-Ben (busy)We declare no competing interests.", "S1473-30992030196-1": "Background\nCoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) causes severe community and nosocomial outbreaks.

Nasopharyngeal and throat swabs are usually obtained for serial viral load monitoring of respiratory infections but gathering these specimens can cause discomfort for patients and put health-care workers at risk. We aimed to ascertain the serial respiratory viral load of SARS-CoV-2 in posterior oropharyngeal (deep throat) saliva samples from patients with COVID-19, and serum antibody responses.\nMethods\nWe did a cohort study at two hospitals in Hong Kong. We included patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19. We obtained samples of blood, urine, posterior oropharyngeal saliva, and rectal swabs. Serial viral load was ascertained by reverse transcriptase quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR). Antibody levels against the SARS-CoV-2 internal nucleoprotein (NP) and surface spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD) were measured using EIA. Whole-genome sequencing was done to identify possible mutations arising during infection.\nFindings\nBetween Jan 22, 2020, and Feb 12, 2020, 30 patients were screened for inclusion, of whom 23 were included (median age 62 years [range 37\u201375]). The median viral load in posterior oropharyngeal saliva or other respiratory specimens at presentation was 5\u00b72 log10 copies per mL (IQR 4\u00b71\u20137\u00b70). Salivary viral load was highest during the first week after symptom onset and subsequently declined with time (slope \u22120\u00b715, 95% CI \u22120\u00b719 to \u22120\u00b711; R2=0\u00b771). In one patient, viral RNA was detected 25 days after symptom onset. Older age was correlated with higher viral load (Spearman's \u03c1=0\u00b748, 95% CI 0\u00b7074\u20130\u00b775; p=0\u00b7020). For 16 patients with serum samples available 14 days or longer after symptom onset, rates of seropositivity were 94% for anti-NP IgG (n=15), 88% for anti-NP IgM (n=14), 100% for anti-RBD IgG (n=16), and 94% for anti-RBD IgM (n=15). Anti-SARS-CoV-2-NP or anti-SARS-CoV-2-RBD IgG levels correlated with virus neutralisation titre (R2>0\u00b79). No genome mutations were detected on serial samples.\nInterpretation\nPosterior oropharyngeal saliva samples are a non-invasive specimen more acceptable to patients and health-care workers. Unlike severe acute respiratory syndrome, patients with COVID-19 had the highest viral load near presentation, which could account for the fast-spreading nature of this epidemic. This finding emphasises the importance of stringent infection control and early use of potent antiviral agents, alone or in combination, for high-risk individuals. Serological assay can complement RT-qPCR for diagnosis.\nFunding\nRichard and Carol Yu, May Tam Mak Mei Yin, The Shaw Foundation Hong Kong, Michael Tong, Marina Lee, Government Consultancy Service, and Sanming Project of Medicine.Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) causes severe community and nosocomial outbreaks.

Reliable data for profiles of serial viral load and serum antibody responses are needed urgently to guide antiviral treatment, infection control, epidemiological measures, and vaccination. The peak viral load of patients with MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV infections occurs at around 7\u201310 days after symptom onset, which could be associated with nosocomial outbreaks involving health-care workers.2\n,  4\nClinical studies of antiviral agents for SARS showed that the viral load decreased significantly with treatment success.5\nNo systematic study of these two important variables with statistical analysis has been done for SARS-CoV-2, although preliminary descriptive studies have been reported.6\n,  7\n,  8Research in context\nEvidence before this study\nWe searched PubMed on Feb 24, 2020, with no limitations by starting date, with the terms \u201cCOVID-19\u201d, \u201ccoronavirus\u201d, \u201cantibody\u201d, and \u201cviral load\u201d; we restricted our search to articles published in English.

However, collection of nasopharyngeal or throat swab specimens can induce coughing and sneezing, which generates aerosol and is a potential health hazard for health-care workers. Collection of throat swabs also requires direct inspection of the patient's posterior pharynx and tonsils. Furthermore, collection of nasopharyngeal specimens is a relatively invasive procedure, which is uncomfortable and can even induce bleeding. A patient's reluctance to provide a sample can account for the paucity of timepoints in viral load studies of respiratory virus infections. Findings of previous studies have shown high concordance between saliva and nasopharyngeal aspirate as specimens for laboratory diagnosis of respiratory viruses.9\nWe have reported use of posterior oropharyngeal (deep throat) saliva for diagnosis and viral load monitoring in a cohort of 12 patients with COVID-19.6\nHere, we report use of self-collected posterior oropharyngeal saliva samples from patients with COVID-19, which avoids close contact between health-care workers and patients, for viral load monitoring. We also monitored serial serum antibody levels of patients.We included consecutive patients with laboratory confirmed COVID-19 who were admitted to Princess Margaret Hospital and Queen Mary Hospital in Hong Kong. In Hong Kong, patients were tested for SARS-CoV-2 based on clinical and epidemiological criteria as outlined and updated by the Hospital Authority. Initial laboratory confirmation was done using nasopharyngeal or sputum specimens at the Public Health Laboratory Centre of Hong Kong. We excluded patients if archived saliva or serum samples were insufficient for testing.This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the University of Hong Kong/Hospital Authority Hong Kong West Cluster (UW 13-372). Since archived specimens were used, written informed consent was waived. 12 of 23 patients included in this study have been reported previously,6\nbut their clinical information, viral load by single copy RNA-dependent RNA polymerase-helicase gene, antibody response, or viral genome analysis has not been reported before.For viral load monitoring, all patients were asked to produce an early morning saliva sample from the posterior oropharynx (ie, coughed up by clearing the throat) before toothbrushing and breakfast, because nasopharyngeal secretions move posteriorly and bronchopulmonary secretions move by ciliary activity to the posterior oropharyngeal area while the patients are in a supine position during sleep. Patients were instructed and supervised by nurses. Viral transport medium was added to the saliva specimen. If patients were intubated, we obtained endotracheal aspirate instead of posterior oropharynx saliva.6\n,  9\n,  10\n,  11\nOur initial experience showed that such saliva samples are promising in viral load monitoring in patients with COVID-19.6\nWe also retrieved serum remnant from blood samples taken for routine biochemical testing, and refrigerated these samples at \u221220\u00b0C until antibody testing could be done.We recorded clinical findings in a predesigned database, including a patient's history and physical examination and findings of haematological, biochemical, radiological, and microbiological investigations. We defined severe disease as the need for supplemental oxygen, admission to the intensive care unit (ICU), or death.We did in-house reverse transcriptase quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) targeting the SARS-CoV-2 RNA-dependent-RNA-polymerase-helicase gene region, as described (appendix p 1).12\nWe did EIAs for SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein (NP) and spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD), as described but with modifications.13\nRecombinant NP and spike protein RBD of SARS-CoV-2 were used for the EIAs. We assessed the purity of NP and RBD by sodium dodecyl sulphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and western blotting (figure 1A, B; appendix pp 2\u20133). A positive sample was included in each run as a positive control. We used an archived anonymous sample from 2018 as a negative control.14\nThe cutoff for seropositivity was set as the mean value of 93 anonymous archived serum specimens from 2018, plus 3 SDs. We verified the validity of EIAs by competitive EIA (appendix p 6) and by western blotting, using patients' serum samples (figure 1C, D; appendix p 9). We did microneutralisation assays and virus culture, as described (appendix pp 1\u20135).6\n,  15\nWe did whole-genome sequencing using the Oxford Nanopore MinION device (Oxford Nanopore Technologies, Oxford, UK), as described (appendix p 4).1\nFigure 1Recombinant NP and RBD of spike protein used for EIA\nShow full caption\nView Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)We did statistical analyses using SPSS version 26.0 or PRISM version 6.0.

Ten patients had severe COVID-19, of whom all required oxygen supplementation, and 13 patients had mild disease. The median age of patients was 62 years (range 37\u201375). 11 (48%) of 23 patients had chronic medical illnesses, and the most common underlying diseases were hypertension in six (26%) patients and diabetes in four (17%).

On presentation, the most common symptom was fever in 22 patients (96%), followed by cough in five (22%), chills in four (17%), and dyspnoea in four (17%; table). Dyspnoea was significantly more frequent among the ten patients with severe disease than among those with mild disease (four [40%] of ten vs none [0%] of 13; p=0\u00b7024). Serum alkaline phosphatase was significantly higher among patients with severe disease than among those with mild disease (74 U/L [range 56\u2013149] vs 60 U/L [38\u2013118]; p=0\u00b7026). The lymphocyte count was lower among patients with severe disease than among those with mild disease (0\u00b765\u2008\u00d7\u2008109 cells per L [range 0\u00b730\u20131\u00b790] vs 1\u00b703 [0\u00b757\u20132\u00b725]), but this difference was not significant (p=0\u00b7088). Lymphopenia and neutrophilia were present in a higher proportion of patients with severe disease than in those with mild disease, but the differences were not significant (p=0\u00b7090 and p=0\u00b7068, respectively).Chest radiographic abnormalities were seen in 15 (65%) patients. Multifocal ground-glass lung opacities were seen in 17 (74%) patients on CT. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in blood samples in five (22%) patients and rectal swabs in four (27%), but the detection rate between severe and mild cases did not differ (p=0\u00b762 and p=0\u00b757, respectively; table). SARS-CoV-2 RNA was not detected in any urine specimens. Lopinavir\u2013ritonavir with or without ribavirin or interferon beta 1b was given in 18 (78%) patients at different timepoints after symptom onset.In total, 173 respiratory specimens were obtained from 23 patients (mean 7\u00b75 respiratory specimens per patient). The median viral load at presentation was 5\u00b72 log10 copies per mL (IQR 4\u00b71\u20137\u00b70). SARS-CoV-2 RNA was not detected in the saliva of three (13%) patients. Specimens with undetectable viral load were assigned a value of 1 log10 copies per mL. No correlation was noted between days after symptom onset and initial viral load (Spearman's \u03c1=0\u00b748; p=0\u00b797). The viral load in posterior oropharyngeal saliva samples was highest during the first week of symptom onset then gradually declined (slope \u22120\u00b715, 95% CI \u22120\u00b719 to \u22120\u00b711; R2=0\u00b771; figure 2). Endotracheal aspirate viral load was available from day 8 after symptom onset and showed a non-significant decline (slope \u22120\u00b713, 95% CI \u22120\u00b731 to 0\u00b704; R2=0\u00b715). Of the 21 patients who survived, seven (33%) had viral RNA detected for 20 days or longer after symptom onset. No association was seen between prolonged detection of viral RNA (\u226520 days after symptom onset) and severity of illness (p=0\u00b735). One patient had viral RNA detected for up to 25 days after symptom onset; another patient had undetectable viral load on days 21 and 22 after symptom onset, with rebound of viral load on days 23 and 24, followed by 5 days of undetectable viral load.\nFigure 2Temporal profile of serial viral load from all patients (n=23)\nShow full caption\nView Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)A significant positive correlation between age and peak viral load was noted (Spearman's \u03c1=0\u00b748, 95% CI 0\u00b7074\u20130\u00b775; p=0\u00b7020; figure 3A). The median initial (p=0\u00b756) and peak (p=0\u00b752) viral loads in severe cases were about 1 log10 higher than those in mild cases, although the difference was not significant (figure 3B, C). The initial (p=0\u00b749) and peak (p=0\u00b729) viral loads did not differ between patients without comorbidities and those with comorbidities (figure 3D, E). For patients with both viral load and antibody results available in week 1 or week 3, median viral load was 6\u00b770 log10 copies per mL (range 4\u00b717\u20138\u00b764), and the concomitant median optical density (OD) for anti-NP IgG was 0\u00b713 (range 0\u00b710\u20131\u00b783) in week 1, whereas in week 3, median viral load was 4\u00b791 log10 copies per mL (range 3\u00b799\u20138\u00b794) and the concomitant median OD for anti-NP IgG was 2\u00b759 (range 2\u00b712\u20132\u00b765).\nFigure 3Relation between viral load and age or disease severity\nShow full caption\nView Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)108 serum specimens were obtained from 23 patients (mean 4\u00b77 serum specimens per patient). An increase was noted in IgG or IgM antibody levels against NP or RBD for most patients at 10 days or later after symptom onset, as shown by OD values in EIA (figure 4). When comparing the onset of seropositivity between anti-RBD and anti-NP, more patients had earlier seropositivity for anti-RBD than anti-NP for both IgG (RBD earlier, ten [43%] of 23 vs NP earlier, two [9%] of 23) and IgM (RBD earlier, six [26%] of 23 vs NP earlier, four [17%] of 23). When comparing the onset of seropositivity between IgG and IgM, more patients had earlier seroconversion for IgG than IgM for anti-NP (IgG earlier, six [26%] of 23 vs IgM earlier, one [4%] of 23) and anti-RBD (IgG earlier, 13 [57%] of 23 vs IgM earlier, one [4%] of 23). For 16 patients with serum specimens available for 14 days or longer after symptom onset, the rate of seropositivity was 94% for anti-NP IgG (n=15), 88% for anti-NP IgM (n=14), 100% for anti-RBD IgG (n=16), and 94% for anti-RBD IgM (n=15).\nFigure 4Temporal profiles of serum IgM and IgG against NP and spike protein RBD, as ascertained by EIA\nShow full caption\nView Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To assess for host factors that affect the antibody titre, the correlation was analysed between the highest OD value during the convalescent period (third week after symptom onset) and age or comorbidities. Patients with comorbidities had a lower anti-RBD IgG OD than did those without comorbidities, although the difference was not significant (median OD, 0\u00b765 vs 1\u00b732; p=0\u00b715; appendix p 7). No association was seen between comorbidity and anti-NP IgG or IgM OD values, or between age and anti-NP IgM or IgG or anti-RBD IgM or IgG OD values (appendix p 8).Specimens with microneutralisation assay titres less than 10 were assigned a value of 5, and specimens with microneutralisation assay titres greater than 320 were assigned a value of 640. For one patient, a microneutralisation antibody assay was done with ten serial samples. The correlation between microneutralisation assay titres and anti-NP IgG (R2=0\u00b799) or anti-RBD IgG (R2=0\u00b796) was better than those between microneutralisation assay titres and anti-NP IgM (R2=0\u00b788) or anti-RBD IgM (R2=0\u00b787; figure 5).\nFigure 5Correlation between MN antibody titres and anti-NP or anti-RBD IgG or IgM\nShow full caption\nView Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Nanopore sequencing was successful for paired samples from four patients. The interval between the first and second specimens was 1\u20133 days. No viral mutations were identified between paired samples from individual patients.We analysed the serial viral load, antibody kinetics, and viral genome of patients with COVID-19 in Hong Kong. For most patients, the viral load of SARS-CoV-2 was very high at presentation and declined steadily. Despite development of antibodies against surface and internal proteins of SARS-CoV-2, viral RNA could still be detected in posterior oropharyngeal (deep throat) saliva samples from a third of patients for 20 days or longer. Peak viral load correlated positively with age. Most patients had an antibody response at 10 days or later after onset of symptoms. Viral whole-genome sequencing of paired samples from four patients did not identify any single nucleotide polymorphisms.A high viral load on presentation of COVID-19 was recorded in our cohort, even for patients who were hospitalised shortly after symptom onset. Using nasal swab and throat swab, Zou and colleagues8\nhave also reported a high viral load shortly after symptom onset. However, in that study, only cycle threshold values (not exact viral loads) were reported, and no statistical or correlative analysis was done with clinical variables such as age, comorbidities, disease severity, and antibody response. The viral load profile of SARS-CoV-2 is similar to that of influenza, which peaks at around the time of symptom onset, but contrasts with that of SARS-CoV at around 10 days and that of MERS-CoV at the second week after symptom onset.4\n,  16\n,  17\nThe high viral load on presentation suggests that SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted easily, even when symptoms are relatively mild. This finding could account for the efficient person-to-person transmission noted in community and health-care settings. Clusters in families, workplaces, religious gatherings, and food premises have been widely reported.18The viral load profile is important for guiding antiviral treatment. Since viral load had already peaked around the time of hospital admission, the risk of emergence of antiviral resistance could be similar to that of single-drug treatment of influenza by adamantanes, acid polymerase inhibitors, and neuraminidase inhibitors. However, our previous clinical trial of influenza treatment showed that a triple antiviral combination could significantly improve the clinical outcome and viral load profile and could reduce emergence of resistant virus quasispecies.19\nCurrently, no standard treatment is available for COVID-19. For SARS-CoV infection, our previous treatment study showed that a combination of lopinavir\u2013ritonavir and ribavirin led to significantly fewer complications (eg, acute respiratory distress syndrome) or deaths than reported with historical controls treated with ribavirin.5\nLopinavir\u2013ritonavir or interferon beta 1b also reduced lung damage and decreased viral load in a non-human primate model of MERS-CoV.20\nLopinavir is a protease inhibitor with in-vitro activity against SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. However, the idea that SARS-CoV 3C-like protease was the antiviral target of lopinavir was based purely on binding in computational modelling.21\nOther protease inhibitors and nucleotide analogues (eg, remdesivir [Gilead Sciences, Foster City, CA, USA]) are potential candidates for treatment. Combination treatment with virus-targeting and host-targeting agents to improve clinical outcome should be investigated.Studies for SARS-CoV have shown that a high initial viral load was associated with death.22\nHowever, our study only showed that the median viral load was 1 log10 higher in severe cases than in mild cases, and the difference was not significant. But, older age was associated with a higher peak viral load. In a previous study of patients infected with SARS-CoV, older age was an independent factor associated with higher viral load,23\nas expected for immunosenescence, which impairs our innate and adaptive immune responses.SARS-CoV-2 RNA could be detected for 20 days or longer in a third of patients who survived in our cohort, and one patient had SARS-CoV-2 RNA detected for 25 days. Prolonged detection of viral RNA of 20 days or longer was also commonly seen for patients with MERS-CoV or SARS-CoV infections.4\n,  16\nProlonged detection of viral RNA represents a challenge for the limited availability of hospital isolation facilities because patients might not be discharged until viral RNA is undetectable in respiratory specimens. Further studies are warranted to ascertain whether patients are shedding live virus, by viral culture of the prolonged RT-PCR-positive specimens obtained from patients with concomitant seropositivity when shedded virions are coated with host antibodies which render them non-infectious.A criterion for discontinuation of transmission-based precautions is a negative RT-qPCR result from two sets of nasopharyngeal and throat swab specimens. In the current study, one patient with complete symptom resolution tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 again after 2 days of negative findings. Our results suggest that SARS-CoV-2 might be excreted at low levels despite clinical recovery. Thus, both serial viral load monitoring and antibody response should be considered when making decisions about infection control measures, because viral load seemed to be related inversely to serum antibody response in this study.The antibody profile is vital for timing requests for serological assays and interpretation of antibody test results. Serological diagnosis is important for patients who present late with a very low viral load, below the detection limit of RT-PCR assays. Because most patients have rising antibody titres 10 days after symptom onset, collection of serial serum samples in the convalescent phase would be more useful. Serum IgG amounts can rise at the same time or earlier than those of IgM against SARS-CoV-2. By comparison with findings of a study on IgM and IgG EIA, in which more patients were seropositive for IgG than IgM at day 0 and day 5 of hospital admission,24\na higher proportion of patients in the current study also had earlier IgG than IgM seroconversion. However, this finding could also be accounted for by a lower sensitivity of the IgM EIA, which warrants investigations with more patients.Serum antibody levels were not correlated with clinical severity. Notably, one patient with severe disease had an early antibody response 6 days after symptom onset. Deceased patients infected with SARS-CoV developed faster peak anti-spike antibody responses when compared with patients who recovered25\nand had subsequent reduced B-cell immunity with impaired neutralising ability. In a SARS-CoV macaque model, anti-spike IgG stimulated pulmonary proinflammatory responses and caused acute lung injury.26\nThe detrimental effect of anti-spike IgG was attributable to the effect on wound-healing macrophages, which was mediated via the Fc\u03b3 receptor. Our findings showing correlation between antibody level detected by EIA and virus neutralisation titre are especially important for design of vaccine studies, and use of convalescent plasma or therapeutic monoclonal antibodies, which could improve clinical outcome or paradoxically cause immunopathological damage to the recipient.Whole-genome sequencing on paired samples from four patients was successful and showed no differences in individually paired genome sequences. However, single nucleotide polymorphisms were shown to emerge during hospitalisation for MERS-CoV infection, using a targeted sequencing approach.27\nFurther studies in more patients with samples obtained at longer intervals could be more informative.A high viral load in throat wash and saliva (up to 108 copies per mL of SARS-CoV RNA) was reported in 17 patients with SARS.28\nIn a Chinese macaque model of SARS-CoV, salivary gland ducts were early targets of SARS-CoV and, therefore, were a likely source of the virions found in patients' saliva, particularly early in infection.29\nBecause of these important findings, our study used posterior oropharyngeal saliva brought up by a throat-clearing manoeuvre to ascertain the temporal viral load profile. The posterior oropharynx is the meeting point between secretions coming from the posterior nasopharynx and the salivary glands and respiratory secretions swept up from the tracheal-bronchial tree. Testing of saliva could show viral shedding from both the salivary glands and the upper and lower respiratory tract. Moreover, because of greater patient acceptability for posterior oropharyngeal saliva samples than for nasopharyngeal or throat swabs, we obtained 7\u00b75 respiratory specimens per patient for testing. Thus, our temporal viral load profile can be analysed by statistics, unlike previous clinical studies of viral kinetics of infections by highly pathogenic betacoronaviruses.8\n,  16\nFurther studies are needed to ascertain whether the salivary glands can be infected by SARS-CoV-2.Our study has several limitations. First, we could only include a few patients, and viral load and antibody titre data were not available everyday. This limitation is a common problem in studies of emerging infections such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.16\nThe few patients enrolled does not allow for adjustment for potential confounding factors that could affect viral load or antibody response. Second, 48% of patients enrolled had chronic medical illness, which is a higher proportion than that reported in a large clinical series (24%).30\nAlthough a lower anti-RBD IgG level was noted among patients with comorbidities, further studies are warranted with more patients. Third, posterior oropharyngeal saliva samples cannot differentiate whether the virus is coming from the nasopharynx or from secretions from the lower respiratory tract; thus, our study cannot indicate whether SARS-CoV-2 has a predilection for both upper and lower respiratory tract. Moreover, some patients might not clear the throat effectively to cough out saliva from deep in the throat, which could decrease test sensitivity when compared with that of nasopharyngeal swabs, particularly in patients with predominant upper respiratory involvement or mild symptoms. Finally, the most abundantly expressed internal NP might have some cross-antigenicity between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV (90% amino acid homology) and, occasionally, OC43-CoV (38% amino acid homology).31\nThus, the less abundantly expressed surface spike protein RBD, which is specific for SARS-CoV-2 and is the direct target for neutralising antibodies, was used to guard the specificity of our dual antibody assays.32COVID-19 is an emerging infection with many unknowns. This study has shed light on viral kinetics and antibody response in patients and provides scientific evidence for guiding infection control policies and therapeutics. Further virological and immunological studies are needed to understand SARS-CoV-2 infection; infection control measures should be reviewed with the rapidly evolving epidemiology of COVID-19.ContributorsKK-WT and K-YY contributed to study design, data collection, data analysis, data interpretation, the literature search, and writing of the report.

We aimed to investigate options for early intervention in Singapore should local containment (eg, preventing disease spread through contact tracing efforts) be unsuccessful.\nMethods\nWe adapted an influenza epidemic simulation model to estimate the likelihood of human-to-human transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in a simulated Singaporean population. Using this model, we estimated the cumulative number of SARS-CoV-2 infections at 80 days, after detection of 100 cases of community transmission, under three infectivity scenarios (basic reproduction number [R0] of 1\u00b75, 2\u00b70, or 2\u00b75) and assuming 7\u00b75% of infections are asymptomatic. We first ran the model assuming no intervention was in place (baseline scenario), and then assessed the effect of four intervention scenarios compared with a baseline scenario on the size and progression of the outbreak for each R0 value. These scenarios included isolation measures for infected individuals and quarantining of family members (hereafter referred to as quarantine); quarantine plus school closure; quarantine plus workplace distancing; and quarantine, school closure, and workplace distancing (hereafter referred to as the combined intervention). We also did sensitivity analyses by altering the asymptomatic fraction of infections (22\u00b77%, 30\u00b70%, 40\u00b70%, and 50\u00b70%) to compare outbreak sizes under the same control measures.\nFindings\nFor the baseline scenario, when R0 was 1\u00b75, the median cumulative number of infections at day 80 was 279\u2008000 (IQR 245\u2008000\u2013320\u2008000), corresponding to 7\u00b74% (IQR 6\u00b75\u20138\u00b75) of the resident population of Singapore. The median number of infections increased with higher infectivity: 727\u2008000 cases (670\u2008000\u2013776\u2008000) when R0 was 2\u00b70, corresponding to 19\u00b73% (17\u00b78\u201320\u00b76) of the Singaporean population, and 1\u2008207\u2008000 cases (1\u2008164\u2008000\u20131\u2008249\u2008000) when R0 was 2\u00b75, corresponding to 32% (30\u00b79\u201333\u00b71) of the Singaporean population. Compared with the baseline scenario, the combined intervention was the most effective, reducing the estimated median number of infections by 99\u00b73% (IQR 92\u00b76\u201399\u00b79) when R0 was 1\u00b75, by 93\u00b70% (81\u00b75\u201399\u00b77) when R0 was 2\u00b70, and by 78\u00b72% (59\u00b70 \u221294\u00b74) when R0 was 2\u00b75. Assuming increasing asymptomatic fractions up to 50\u00b70%, up to 277 000 infections were estimated to occur at day 80 with the combined intervention relative to 1800 for the baseline at R0 of 1\u00b75.\nInterpretation\nImplementing the combined intervention of quarantining infected individuals and their family members, workplace distancing, and school closure once community transmission has been detected could substantially reduce the number of SARS-CoV-2 infections. We therefore recommend immediate deployment of this strategy if local secondary transmission is confirmed within Singapore. However, quarantine and workplace distancing should be prioritised over school closure because at this early stage, symptomatic children have higher withdrawal rates from school than do symptomatic adults from work. At higher asymptomatic proportions, intervention effectiveness might be substantially reduced requiring the need for effective case management and treatments, and preventive measures such as vaccines.\nFunding\nSingapore Ministry of Health, Singapore Population Health Improvement Centre.Since the coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak began in the Chinese city of Wuhan on Dec 31, 2019, 68 imported cases and 175 locally acquired infections have been reported in Singapore. We aimed to investigate options for early intervention in Singapore should local containment (eg, preventing disease spread through contact tracing efforts) be unsuccessful.We adapted an influenza epidemic simulation model to estimate the likelihood of human-to-human transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in a simulated Singaporean population. Using this model, we estimated the cumulative number of SARS-CoV-2 infections at 80 days, after detection of 100 cases of community transmission, under three infectivity scenarios (basic reproduction number [R0] of 1\u00b75, 2\u00b70, or 2\u00b75) and assuming 7\u00b75% of infections are asymptomatic. We first ran the model assuming no intervention was in place (baseline scenario), and then assessed the effect of four intervention scenarios compared with a baseline scenario on the size and progression of the outbreak for each R0 value. These scenarios included isolation measures for infected individuals and quarantining of family members (hereafter referred to as quarantine); quarantine plus school closure; quarantine plus workplace distancing; and quarantine, school closure, and workplace distancing (hereafter referred to as the combined intervention). We also did sensitivity analyses by altering the asymptomatic fraction of infections (22\u00b77%, 30\u00b70%, 40\u00b70%, and 50\u00b70%) to compare outbreak sizes under the same control measures.For the baseline scenario, when R0 was 1\u00b75, the median cumulative number of infections at day 80 was 279\u2008000 (IQR 245\u2008000\u2013320\u2008000), corresponding to 7\u00b74% (IQR 6\u00b75\u20138\u00b75) of the resident population of Singapore. The median number of infections increased with higher infectivity: 727\u2008000 cases (670\u2008000\u2013776\u2008000) when R0 was 2\u00b70, corresponding to 19\u00b73% (17\u00b78\u201320\u00b76) of the Singaporean population, and 1\u2008207\u2008000 cases (1\u2008164\u2008000\u20131\u2008249\u2008000) when R0 was 2\u00b75, corresponding to 32% (30\u00b79\u201333\u00b71) of the Singaporean population. Compared with the baseline scenario, the combined intervention was the most effective, reducing the estimated median number of infections by 99\u00b73% (IQR 92\u00b76\u201399\u00b79) when R0 was 1\u00b75, by 93\u00b70% (81\u00b75\u201399\u00b77) when R0 was 2\u00b70, and by 78\u00b72% (59\u00b70 \u221294\u00b74) when R0 was 2\u00b75.

Evidence to date has suggested rapid spread of the virus: at the time of writing, imported cases have been reported in 143 countries and territories, including Singapore. 243 confirmed cases have been reported in Singapore; however, this number is expected to increase substantially in the following weeks. In 2003, SARS-CoV, which also originated from mainland China, established locally, causing 33 deaths after 238 cases were confirmed. Therefore, there is considerable concern since 3204 deaths and 81\u2008048 cases of COVID-19 have already been confirmed in mainland China, which surpasses the numbers observed in the SARS-CoV outbreak. 2020 Lunar New Year celebrations have now ended, marking a period of extensive travel between China and Singapore, and a corresponding high risk for case importation. Despite heightened surveillance and isolation of individuals suspected to have COVID-19 and confirmed cases, the risk is ongoing, with the number of cases continuing to increase in Singapore. Immediate deployment of interventions will be required to contain the outbreak in the event that significant secondary local transmission is observed within the community.

Our search yielded three relevant articles. Two articles investigated the effects of travel restrictions in Wuhan during the early stages of the outbreak; one of the articles additionally investigated the effects of quarantine in China, and the other article estimated the effectiveness of airport screening for the detection of infected travellers. We found no articles assessing the efficacy of immediate national control measures outside of China.\nAdded value of this study\nThis study is the first to investigate the use of isolation for individuals with COVID-19 and quarantine of family members, school closures, and workplace distancing as interventions for the immediate control of COVID-19 in the event of secondary local transmission using a simulation model. We found that a combined approach (incorporating quarantine, school closures, and workplace distancing) could prevent a national outbreak at low levels of infectivity and reduce the number of total infections considerably at higher levels of infectivity. Such control measures should be deployed in countries outside of China with evidence of imported cases and evidence of local transmission.\nImplications of all the available evidence\nThe results of this study provide policy makers in Singapore and other countries with evidence to begin the implementation of relatively standard outbreak control measures that could mitigate or reduce local transmission rates if deployed effectively and in a timely manner.Evidence before this studyAt present, in Wuhan, the capital of Hubei province in China, an outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is ongoing, caused by the 2019 novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2; previously called 2019-nCoV).

We found that a combined approach (incorporating quarantine, school closures, and workplace distancing) could prevent a national outbreak at low levels of infectivity and reduce the number of total infections considerably at higher levels of infectivity. Such control measures should be deployed in countries outside of China with evidence of imported cases and evidence of local transmission.Implications of all the available evidenceThe results of this study provide policy makers in Singapore and other countries with evidence to begin the implementation of relatively standard outbreak control measures that could mitigate or reduce local transmission rates if deployed effectively and in a timely manner.Internationally, ongoing local transmission of SARS-CoV-2 has been confirmed in 81 countries and territories.6\n\nIn Singapore, 243 individuals have tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, 121 have been hospitalised and are stable, 13 are in a critical condition, and 109 have been discharged at the time of writing.9\n\nThe first case in Singapore was identified on Jan 23, 2020, and was imported from China;10\n\na further 68 cases were imported, with the remaining 175 cases most likely the result of transmission within Singapore.11\nAll imported cases were travellers who had returned from Wuhan before Feb 4, 2020, with transmission to close contacts recorded within families at a church and shop in three small transmission clusters.11As of March 16, 2020, inpatients with COVID-19 in Singapore are isolated at the hospital they present to or at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases, a specialised facility designed to facilitate infectious disease outbreak response.10\n\nA government-wide taskforce has been established to increase surveillance at borders and prepare the public in terms of awareness and education.10\n\nThe Ministry of Health Singapore has implemented contact tracing efforts to identify potential cases among people travelling with, or in close proximity to, individuals with COVID-19.12\n\nDespite these efforts and nationwide precautionary measures, including the dispensing of masks to households and public hospital emergency departments being on high alert for an outbreak response, the number of suspected and imported cases in Singapore is expected to increase due to the high volume of incoming travellers.10\n\nPreliminary estimates indicate that the ascertainment rate in Wuhan is 5\u00b71% (95% CI 4\u00b78\u20135\u00b75);13\nhowever, high levels of under-reporting and misdiagnosis due to difficulties in identifying cases make it challenging for policy makers to prepare a large-scale response. Consequently, following the recommendations made by Wu and colleagues,14\nmodelling studies are needed to estimate the potential impact of interventions in the early phase of the outbreak when uncertainty is highest, which is crucial should local transmission begin to increase.In this study, we aimed to develop a national spatial model of COVID-19 transmission in Singapore to estimate the distribution of cases across time and space and to assess the potential impact of interventions on outbreak size should local containment efforts fail.We used FluTE,15\nan agent-based influenza epidemic simulation model, which accounts for demography, host movement, and social contact rates in workplaces, schools, and homes to estimate the likelihood of human-to-human transmission of SARS-CoV-2 should local containment fail. The FluTE simulation model requires a synthetic population to build the contact and transmission network. Therefore, we used the geographical, demographic, and epidemiological model of Singapore (hereafter referred to as GeoDEMOS-R, where R represents respiratory illness),16\na modelling framework that aims to recreate a synthetic but realistic representation of the Singaporean population at the household and individual level. We generated the synthetic population using national 2010 census data17\n\n,  18\n\nto fit multiple attributes of the population at the household and individual level. The generated households contained demographic characteristics, such as age, marital status, religion, and ethnicity, of household members. Individuals were then allocated to workplaces or educational facilities on the basis of local transportation data and home addresses according to 2010 census data.19\n\nThe contact behaviour of individuals in the area of their home (ie, between family members and their local community; defined as the home community), workplace, and school, where applicable, were recorded with potential transmission events as a function of infectivity. We ran the models for 80 days to investigate the early stages of an epidemic and seeded 100 local cases randomly among the resident population at 0 days, representing a few generations of local transmission at the time of scenario implementation (ie, when contact tracing has failed to identify cases within the community and unknown local transmission has started). A full description of the model is available in the appendix (pp 1\u20135).Within the FluTE infection model, we assumed that no individual had existing immunity to SARS-CoV-2. Since data (ie, infectiousness, the cumulative distribution function for the incubation period, and the duration of hospital stay) on SARS-CoV-2 were unavailable at the time of designing this study, we used SARS-CoV parameters to estimate the infectivity profile of SARS-CoV-2. These parameters included how infectious an individual is over time,20\nthe proportion of the population assumed to be asymptomatic (7\u00b75%),21\nthe cumulative distribution function for the mean incubation period (with SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 having the same mean incubation period of 5\u00b73 days),3\n,  22\nand the duration of hospital stay after symptom onset (3\u00b75 days).20\nAsymptomatic individuals were able to infect at a 50% reduced rate compared with their symptomatic counterparts based on estimates from Nishiura and colleagues.23We also investigated four alternate asymptomatic proportions: 22\u00b77%, as reported by Furuya-Kanamori and colleagues24\nfor influenza A H1N1 in a pooled prevalence study; and 30\u00b70%, 40\u00b70%, and 50\u00b70%, as potential but theoretical proportions to investigate intervention efficacy with a high fraction of infections that are cryptic and undetectable.Three values for the basic reproduction number (R0) were chosen for the infectiousness factor (1\u00b75, 2\u00b70, and 2\u00b75) on the basis of analyses of Wuhan case data by Wu and colleagues.14For the baseline scenario (ie, no interventions), we ran 1000 epidemic simulations to account for the stochasticity in infection contact networks and to calculate CIs across time. Four intervention scenarios were proposed for implementation after failure of local containment, following policy options currently being assessed by the Singaporean Ministry of Health, as standard interventions for respiratory virus control: isolation of infected individuals and quarantine of their family members (hereafter referred to as quarantine); quarantine plus immediate school closure for 2 weeks; quarantine plus immediate workplace distancing, in which 50% of the workforce is encouraged to work from home for 2 weeks; and a combination of quarantine, immediate school closure, and workplace distancing (hereafter referred to as the combined intervention). Quarantine of infected individuals is expected to occur 1 day after symptom onset in a health-care facility that is assumed to have 3000 beds at maximum capacity (during the early stage of the outbreak) and is fully equipped to handle full quarantine measures (ie, negative pressure isolation rooms, full personal protective equipment use by staff) so that the individual is unable to transmit SARS-CoV-2 to other inpatients. At full capacity, the remaining individuals are isolated at home after receiving treatment. Family members of infected individuals are quarantined at home for 14 days and thus are unable to attend work or school or infect the wider community at their residential address. However, transmission within families is possible as a result of the presence of an isolated and infected individual. Each of these intervention scenarios had 1000 simulations in which we additionally recorded the location of infection as the home community, workplace, or school (appendix pp 3\u20134).Each of the 1000 epidemic simulations had a set of parameters, and was run for baseline and the four control strategies. The median simulation was determined as the median cumulative number of cases at day 80. The same set of parameters was used for each 1000 set of simulations for each R0 value. When analysing differences across infectivity scenarios, we compared the outputs of each simulation, which used the same parameters, not the medians of each grouping. We calculated IQRs as the 25th and 75th simulation in terms of cumulative case count at 80 days. We used R statistical software (version 3.6.3) to plot graphs and for all analyses. We chose to present intervention data for the scenario in which R0 is 2\u00b70, because this represents a moderate and likely outbreak for policy planners. The relatively mild (R0=1\u00b75) and severe (R0=2.5) outbreak scenarios are presented in the appendix (pp 9\u201310).The funders had no role in study design, data collection, data analysis, data interpretation, or writing of the report. The corresponding author had full access to all the data in the study and had final responsibility for the decision to submit for publication.For the baseline scenario, when R0 was 1\u00b75, the median cumulative number of infections on day 80 was 279\u2008000 (IQR 245\u2008000\u2013320\u2008000; figure 1, table), which corresponds to 7\u00b74% (IQR 6\u00b75\u20138\u00b75) of the population. For the quarantine intervention, the median cumulative number of infections at day 80 was reduced to 15\u2008000 (800\u201330\u2008000; table; appendix p 9), which is a 94\u00b78% decrease (90\u00b72\u201399\u00b77) in the number of infected individuals compared with the baseline scenario. School closure and workplace distancing reduced the median cumulative number of infections on day 80 to 10\u2008000 (200\u201328\u2008000) and 4000 (200\u201323\u2008000), respectively (table; appendix p 9). The combined intervention decreased the median cumulative infection count on day 80 to 1800 (200\u201323\u2008000; table; appendix p 9), representing a 99\u00b73% (IQR 92\u00b76\u201399\u00b79) reduction from the baseline scenario. The corresponding maximum number of daily infections from day 0 to day 80 was 12\u2008400 (IQR 11\u2008700\u201312\u2008900) for the baseline scenario, 600 (0\u20131400) for the quarantine scenario, 500 (0\u20131300) for the school-closure scenario, 300 (0\u2013900) for the workplace-distancing scenario, and 120 (0\u2013900) for the combined intervention (figure 1; appendix p 9).\nFigure 1Total daily number and cumulative number of SARS-CoV-2 infections up to 80 days after failure of local containment for the baseline scenario, by infectivity level\nShow full caption\nView Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)\nTableEstimated median or cumulative number of SARS-CoV-2 infections on day 80 by location, intervention, and level of infectivity\nBaseline Quarantine School closure Workplace distancing Combined intervention\nR0=1\u00b75\nTotal number of infections 279\u2008000 (245\u2008000\u2013320\u2008000) 15\u2008000 (800\u201330\u2008000) 10\u2008000 (200\u201328\u2008000) 4000 (200\u201323\u2008000) 1800 (200\u201323\u2008000)\nHome community 138\u2008000 (116\u2008000\u2013152\u2008000) 2200 (300\u20137800) 2000 (117\u20137200) 700 (98\u20135500) 300 (13\u20135700)\nSchool 1400 (1100\u20131500) 14 (5\u201380) 16 (2\u201370) 7 (4\u201351) 1 (0\u201354)\nWorkplace 139\u2008000 (128\u2008000\u2013164\u2008000) 12\u2008000 (500\u201321\u2008900) 8000 (124\u201321\u2008000) 3500 (102\u201317\u2008800) 1500 (42\u201318\u2008000)\nR0=2\u00b70\nTotal number of infections 727\u2008000 (670\u2008000\u2013776\u2008000) 130\u2008000 (38\u2008000\u2013244\u2008000) 97\u2008000 (14\u2008000\u2013219\u2008000) 67 000 (11 000\u2013145 000) 50\u2008000 (2000\u2013143\u2008000)\nHome community 372\u2008000 (339\u2008000\u2013411\u2008000) 66\u2008000 (23\u2008000\u2013129\u2008000) 46\u2008000 (11\u2008000\u2013113\u2008000) 28\u2008000 (8000\u201379\u2008000) 21\u2008000 (1200\u201368\u2008000)\nSchool 4300 (3700\u20134300) 600 (100\u20131200) 500 (27\u20131000) 300 (33\u2013800) 200 (11\u2013800)\nWorkplace 351\u2008000 (327\u2008000\u2013361\u2008000) 63\u2008000 (15\u2008000\u2013127\u2008000) 51\u2008000 (3000\u2013105\u2008000) 38\u2008000 (2800\u201365\u2008000) 28\u2008000 (800\u201367\u2008000)\nR0=2\u00b75\nTotal number of infections 1\u2008207\u2008000 (1\u2008164\u2008000\u20131\u2008249\u2008000) 520\u2008000 (268\u2008000\u2013754\u2008000) 466\u2008000 (175\u2008000\u2013728\u2008000) 320\u2008000 (116\u2008000\u2013558\u2008000) 258\u2008000 (65\u2008000\u2013508\u2008000)\nHome community 640\u2008000 (623\u2008000\u2013675\u2008000) 264\u2008000 (144\u2008000\u2013410\u2008000) 235\u2008000 (92\u2008000\u2013366\u2008000) 163\u2008000 (66\u2008000\u2013281\u2008000) 132\u2008000 (34\u2008000\u2013265\u2008000)\nSchool 7100 (7200\u20137900) 3000 (1400\u20134000) 2400 (1300\u20133600) 1500 (800\u20133400) 1300 (300\u20132800)\nWorkplace 560\u2008000 (550\u2008000\u2013584\u2008000) 253\u2008000 (140\u2008000\u2013390\u2008000) 228\u2008000 (82\u2008000\u2013358\u2008000) 156\u2008000 (49\u2008000\u2013274\u2008000) 124\u2008000 (31\u2008000\u2013241\u2008000)\nData are median (IQR).

On day 80, quarantine resulted in a cumulative median of 130\u2008000 cases (38\u2008000\u2013244\u2008000), school closure 97\u2008000 cases (14\u2008000\u2013219\u2008000), workplace distancing 67\u2008000 cases (11\u2008000\u2013145\u2008000), and the combined intervention 50\u2008000 cases (2000\u2013143\u2008000; figure 2, table). The maximum number of daily infections was 27\u2008800 (IQR 27\u2008300\u201328\u2008000) for the baseline scenario, 11\u2008000 (4100\u201318\u2008600) for the quarantine scenario, 8400 (1900\u201317\u2008000) for the school-closure scenario, 6100 (1500\u201312\u2008000) for the workplace-distancing scenario, and 4900 (100\u201311\u2008700) for the combined intervention (Figure 1, Figure 2). The combined approach resulted in the largest reduction in cases from baseline (93\u00b70% reduction [IQR 81\u00b75\u201399\u00b77]).\nFigure 2Total daily number and cumulative number of SARS-CoV-2 infections up to 80 days under different intervention scenarios when R0 is 2\u00b70\nShow full caption\nView Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)For the baseline scenario, when R0 was 2\u00b75, 32% (IQR 30\u00b79\u201333\u00b71) of the Singaporean population were infected, with a cumulative median of 1\u2008207\u2008000 cases (IQR 1\u2008164\u2008000\u20131\u2008249\u2008000) on day 80 (figure 1, table). At this level of transmission, quarantine resulted in a median of 520\u2008000 cases (268\u2008000\u2013754\u2008000), school closure 466\u2008000 cases (175\u2008000\u2013728\u2008000), workplace distancing 320\u2008000 cases (116\u2008000\u2013558\u2008000), and the combined intervention 258\u2008000 cases (65\u2008000\u2013508\u2008000; table; appendix p 10). The maximum number of daily infections was 42\u2008800 (IQR 41 400\u201343\u2008500) for the baseline scenario, 37\u2008900 (25\u2008900\u201341\u2008800) for the quarantine scenario, 36\u2008400 (18\u2008100\u201341\u2008400) for the school-closure scenario, 29\u2008800 (12\u2008500\u201340\u2008500) for the workplace-distancing scenario, and 25\u2008200 (7700\u201339\u2008200) for the combined intervention (figure 1; appendix p 10). Compared with baseline, the combined approach resulted in the greatest reduction in cases (78\u00b72% [IQR 59\u00b70\u201394\u00b74]).For all simulations, the median age of infection was 37 years (IQR 26\u201349). The location of infection (school, workplace, or home community) was determined according to the site where individuals were exposed to the virus (table). Owing to behaviours of school absenteeism and work-distancing presenteeism, the number of infections acquired at work consistently exceeded those at school, although students could be transmitting the virus within the home community (table). Such patterns of transmission are particularly evident for the combined intervention at higher levels of infectivity (R0=2\u00b75), with a median of 1300 infections acquired at school (IQR 300\u20132800), 124\u2008000 at the workplace (31\u2008000\u2013241\u2008000), and 132\u2008000 (34\u2008000\u2013265\u2008000) in the home community.The median number of daily infections across time showed that when R0 was 1\u00b75 or 2\u00b70, the epidemic peak was unlikely to occur during the 80-day timeframe, whereas when R0 was 2\u00b75, a peak in cases was observed approximately 9 weeks after reaching 100 community infections (figure 1). When R0 was 2\u00b75, the interventions had a suppressive effect on the number of new cases each day, although the number of cases continued to increase at day 80, indicating a delayed intervention effect rather than a preventive effect as observed when R0 was 1\u00b75 (figure 2; appendix pp 9\u201310). Geospatially, the number of cases across Singapore at day 80 show a high number of home community infections in highly residential areas and considerable infection-source mixing (figure 3; appendix p 11). The combined intervention had the greatest effect on the number of infections, with a universal reduction across Singapore when R0 was 1\u00b75 (figure 3). The combined intervention had a smaller effect when R0 was 2\u00b70 or 2\u00b75, with a relatively homogeneous distribution nationwide, although dense residential clusters in the north of Singapore, in areas near the Malaysia border, indicate strong comparative persistence of the virus despite the use of the combined approach (figure 3).\nFigure 3Geospatial distribution of coronavirus disease 2019 cases at the time of infection at 80 days in Singapore\nShow full caption\nView Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Our models assumed that 7\u00b75% of cases were asymptomatic. Considering a higher asymptomatic proportion of the total infected population of 22\u00b77%, owing to isolation of fewer infected individuals and quarantine of fewer family members, for the quarantine scenario when R0 was 1\u00b75, an additional 100\u2008000 cases (IQR 41\u2008800\u2013152\u2008000) would be observed at 80 days (appendix p 7). Similarly, a higher asymptomatic proportion resulted in a higher median cumulative number of cases for the school-closure, work-distancing, and combined intervention scenarios: an additional 97\u2008000 (IQR 31\u2008200\u2013151\u2008000), 64\u2008800 (10\u2008500\u2013110\u2008000), and 51\u2008000 cases (1500\u2013107\u2008000), respectively, when R0 was 1\u00b75 (appendix p 12). When R0 was 2\u00b70, assuming an asymptomatic proportion of 22\u00b77%, an additional 381\u2008000 cases (IQR 250\u2008000\u2013474\u2008000) were observed for the quarantine scenario, 400\u2008000 cases (275\u2008000\u2013509\u2008000) for the school-closure scenario, 316\u2008000 cases (175\u2008000\u2013433\u2008000) for the workplace-distancing scenario, and 294\u2008000 cases (162\u2008000\u2013430\u2008000) for the combined interventions scenario (appendix p 13). When R0 was 2\u00b75, an additional 577\u2008000 cases (IQR 382\u2008000\u2013777\u2008000), 557\u2008000 cases (372\u2008000\u2013785000), 567\u2008000 cases (379\u2008000\u2013775\u2008000), and 599\u2008000 cases (394\u2008000\u2013804\u2008000) were observed for the quarantine, school-closure, workplace-distancing, and combined intervention scenarios, respectively (appendix p 14). The medians of the number of infections and location of infection for the 22\u00b77% asymptomatic fraction is presented in the appendix (p 7).The median number of infections and location of infection for the higher theoretical asymptomatic proportions are presented in the appendix (p 8). At higher asymptomatic proportions of 30\u00b70%, 40\u00b70%, and 50\u00b70%, further increases were observed (appendix pp 8, 15\u201319). We only ran the analysis at higher asymptomatic rates at the lower level of infectivity (R0=1\u00b75), because we observed substantial increases in the number of cases observed, reflecting poor case control that would otherwise be exacerbated and lead to containment failure at higher infectivity. When R0 was 1\u00b75, interventions caused substantial reductions in the number of infections at asymptomatic fractions of 7\u00b75% and 22\u00b77%. For quarantine, by comparison with the number of cases observed for the 7\u00b75% asymptomatic proportion assumption when R0 was 1\u00b75, the median number of cases increased by 172 000 (IQR 113\u2008000\u2013221\u2008000) for a 30\u00b70% asymptomatic proportion. This number increased to 253\u2008000 (209\u2008000\u2013294\u2008000) for a 40\u00b70% asymptomatic fraction, and to 314\u2008000 (276\u2008000\u2013343\u2008000) for a 50\u00b70% asymptomatic fraction (appendix pp 15\u201317). At an asymptomatic proportion of 30\u00b70%, increases compared with a 7\u00b75% asymptomatic proportion of 172\u2008000 (IQR 104\u2008000\u2013221\u2008000), 124\u2008000 (53\u2008100\u2013170\u2008000), and 114\u2008000 cases (36\u2008300\u2013172\u2008000) were observed for school closure, workplace distancing, and the combined interventions, respectively (appendix pp 15\u201317). Increases for school closure, workplace distancing, and combined interventions were 253\u2008000 (IQR 206\u2008000\u2013287\u2008000), 203\u2008000 (153\u2008000\u2013251\u2008000), and 196\u2008000 cases (134\u2008000\u2013244\u2008000), respectively, for an asymptomatic proportion of 40\u00b70% and 312\u2008000 (278\u2008000\u2013340\u2008000), 269\u2008000 (215\u2008000\u2013308\u2008000), and 267\u2008000 cases (216\u2008000\u2013307\u2008000), respectively, for an asymptomatic proportion of 50\u00b70% (appendix pp 16\u201317).Concerns about COVID-19 becoming a global epidemic are increasing on the basis of previous epidemics, such as SARS-CoV, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and pandemic influenza. The introduction of cases into new countries, regions and cities is likely to continue in areas where local establishment could form, depending on the ongoing level of control measures. In the event that local containment is unsuccessful, our findings suggest that national outbreak control is feasible provided that R0 is low (\u22641\u00b75), with a combination of the proposed intervention measures (quarantine, school closure, and workplace distancing) being most effective. Under this scenario (R0=1\u00b75), workplace distancing reduced the median number of cases from 279\u2008000 (IQR 245\u2008000\u2013 320\u2008000) to 4000 (200\u201323\u2008000), as a result of the high employment rates (around 98%) among individuals of working age in Singapore.25\n\nThis observation is consistent with the conclusions of a review of 15 studies that found a median reduction of 23% (range 12\u201382) in the cumulative influenza A H1N1 attack rate with workplace distancing alone.26\nThe implementation of such a control measure, however, is likely to have an acute societal economic effect on individuals who must work from home or take leave, especially if reimbursement is not possible. Thus, decision making becomes a function of risk as to whether the imported cases have or will infect the local population and cause a local outbreak. An R0 value of 1\u00b75 is not consistent with the evidence from China,14\nand thus prevention of community transmission might not be possible using interventions that would be widely supported by the population.At the start of the outbreak, the risk of repeated importation of SARS-CoV-2 into Singapore was deemed to be considerable given that around 3\u00b74 million people travel from Wuhan to Singapore annually.27\n\nFurthermore, the start of the epidemic coincided with the 2020 Chinese Lunar New Year holiday, with the expectation that the number of individuals arriving from China would be similar to that for the 2018 celebrations (around 800\u2008000 tourists from China).27\n\nThe high influx of incoming travellers exacerbated the risk of local disease establishment, bringing at least 18 initial confirmed imported cases into Singapore before Feb 4, 2020, when the first four local transmission cases were confirmed.11\nThese four cases had contact with at least two infected tourists at a shop, who were identified through intensive contact tracing efforts. Although travel is now reduced, at least 175 subsequent locally-acquired infections have been reported at the time of writing across a diverse range of residential and commercial sites despite efforts by the Singaporean Government to quarantine and isolate infected individuals. On March 16, 2020, 11 of the 17 confirmed cases were imported with travel histories including the UK, Indonesia, Portugal, Spain, the USA, France, Germany, Switzerland, and Belgium.11\nOn March 17, 2020, a further 17 of 23 cases were reported to be imported.11\nWith the risk of disease establishment remaining high from the continued importation of cases, workplace distancing and school closure remain as critical interventions that can avert a significant number of cases.We found that these two interventions, when used in combination with quarantine, would be highly effective at low infection rates (ie, R0 of 1\u00b75), with median of 10\u2008000 cases (IQR 200\u201328 000) observed for school closures and 4000 cases (200\u201323\u2008000) for workplace distancing compared with 279 000 cases (245\u2008000\u2013320\u2008000) at the baseline. At the highest level of infectivity (R0=2\u00b75), substantial reductions were observed with a median of 466\u2008000 cases (IQR 175\u2008000\u2013728\u2008000) observed when school closure was used and 320\u2008000 (116\u2008000\u2013558\u2008000) for workplace distancing compared with 1\u2008207\u2008000 cases (1\u2008164\u2008000\u20131\u2008249\u2008000) at baseline. However, if the preventive effect of these interventions reduces considerably due to higher asymptomatic proportions, more pressure will be placed on the quarantining and treatment of infected individuals, which could become unfeasible when the number of infected individuals exceeds the capacity of health-care facilities.Scale-up of ongoing surveillance programmes and rigorous contract tracing12\n\n,  28\n\nare thus required to assist in the maintenance of a low number of unidentified infections at this time, with school closure and workplace distancing being potentially effective strategies for deployment nationwide should local transmission, with multiple transmission events recorded between individuals in the resident population, begin. Our simulation model, which examined hypothetical infection spread with 100 unidentified Singaporean cases as a seed population, showed that for the baseline scenario (ie, no control interventions) by day 80, when R0 was 1\u00b75, around 279\u2008000 individuals would be infected, when R0 was 2\u00b70, around 727\u2008000 individuals would be infected, and when R0 was 2\u00b75, around 1\u2008207\u2008000 individuals would be infected. In the event that suppression of transmission through quarantine is unsuccessful and local transmission begins, which has currently been observed in other countries on a small scale,29\n,  30\n\npolicy makers in Singapore should deploy alternate measures, such as school closure and workplace distancing, in a timely manner. School closure has been used in the past in Singapore to limit the spread of hand, foot, and mouth disease, and was associated with a decrease of up to 53% in secondary cases,31\nprobably because children generally have high contact rates with their peers in the school environment. Given this historical experience, a similar programme for COVID-19 could be established reasonably quickly. However, at present, data on the susceptibility of children to SARS-CoV-2 infection, the number of infected children in Singapore, and the probability of children becoming symptomatic are limited, making school closure less desirable than workplace distancing.The continually high percentage contribution of work-related infections despite work distancing being effective suggests that the workplace is a key infection site in Singapore, whereby reductions in workplace transmission averts cases at all other sites. The effects of school closure and quarantine were comparable, since the displacement of students to the home community will then rely on quarantine as a measure of preventing infection. However, asymptomatic cases, assumed to account for 7\u00b75% of the infected population, would continue to contribute to transmission, and the identification of these individuals presents a challenge.Increasing the asymptomatic proportion in our model from 7\u00b75% to 22\u00b77%, which is reflective of influenza A H1N1,24\nresulted in limited infection control with considerable stochasticity, whereby the failure of early quarantine led to outbreaks similar in size to those observed for the baseline scenario, even when R0 was 1\u00b75. Under this assumption, the median number of cases averted compared with baseline ranged from 219\u2008000 to 282\u2008000 cases (64\u00b74\u201382\u00b79% reduction) depending on the intervention scenario. For the quarantine, school-closure, work-distancing, and combined intervention scenarios, assuming an asymptomatic proportion of 7\u00b75% and an R0 of 1\u00b75, a median of 264\u2008000\u2013277\u2008200 cases (94\u00b76\u201399\u00b74% reduction) would be averted compared with the baseline scenario. Thus, considering the differences in number of cases averted by proportion of asymptomatic individuals in the population, additional interventions, such as vaccination (where research is rapidly ongoing) or the prescribing of existing antiviral drugs that are effective for the treatment of related viral infections, should be considered. Contact inhibition remains important, but the high proportion of asymptomatic and undocumented infections and missed opportunities to quarantine will make control challenging. Even at a low infectivity (R0 \u22641\u00b75), a high asymptomatic proportion is problematic, with 58\u2008000 infections (IQR 5400\u2013123 000) occurring at an asymptomatic proportion of 22\u00b77% compared with 1800 infections (200\u201323\u2008000) at a 7\u00b75% asymptomatic proportion with the combined intervention'. These effects were exacerbated further at higher asymptomatic proportions of 30\u00b70\u201350\u00b70%. With fewer cases averted and larger outbreak sizes from undocumented spread due to asymptomatic individuals, the dialogue partly shifts from containment to case management to reduce mortality from complications.Regardless of the proportion of individuals in the population with asymptomatic infection, all the proposed interventions should be used in addition to other measures, such as rapid diagnosis and appropriate case management, if local containment fails. Current government-led outbreak control measures will only be successful with public cooperation through exercising good hygiene, infection prevention in shared spaces, and adequate education to understand when symptoms might be indicative of a potential SARS-CoV-2 infection. Public complicity is particularly crucial for older individuals (>60 years), individuals who are immunocompromised, and people with comorbidities who are at high risk of severe complications.5\n\nDuring the 2003 SARS outbreak, 238 probable SARS cases were reported and 33 individuals died in Singapore, with the highest proportion of deaths (45%) reported among people aged 65 years and older.32\n\nThe same observation is thus expected for COVID-19 should local transmission occur since the median age of infection in our models was 37 years (IQR 26\u201349), with comparatively few children becoming infected because of school closure and awareness among parents to quarantine children with fever. Singapore has one of the highest employment rates among older individuals (aged \u226565 years) of all countries within the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)33\nand a culture of eating at so-called hawker centres (ie, food courts), with around 75% of people visiting a hawker centre at least once a week.34\n\nConsequently, many older people are expected to be exposed to infection at work or within their home communities, which could be mitigated in part by implementation of workplace distancing and, if possible, incentivisation to remain at home and practise workplace distancing, specifically for older individuals.At present, the quarantining of family and close contacts of confirmed cases is crucial, as shown by the substantial increase in infection rates among individuals who shared living spaces and bathrooms during the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic in China, despite the regular disinfection of these areas.35\nThe protocols in place at present, including the use of specialist ambulances, negative pressure isolation rooms, and ultraviolet disinfection, will assist in isolating the infection and preventing transmission events at health-care facilities, as was seen during the 2003 SARS outbreak.21\nSince at least 15 medical staff in Wuhan have contracted the virus,3\nSingapore has provided full personal protective equipment for health-care workers; however, the results of our study suggest that community transmission will substantially contribute to transmission should local containment fail despite these measures. The main control measures at this time are surveillance, standard testing procedures,36\nand quarantine of individuals who are confirmed positive for the virus. Such measures have been used in the past for suspected cases of MERS-CoV, which has a 34\u00b74% case-fatality rate,37\nwith no cases of MERS-CoV reported in Singapore to date, and for Zika virus, which established locally in 2016, with only ten cases reported in 2019.38\n\nSuch successes in preventing local outbreaks are attributed to robust disease surveillance in Singapore. Nevertheless, dengue outbreaks are ongoing in Singapore,39\nwhich highlights the difficulties in disease control that are in part due to undocumented spread and individuals who are asymptomatic; these issues are likely to affect the control of the ongoing COVID-19 epidemic since many imported cases worldwide have been asymptomatic on entry to countries.9\n\nThe implementation of school closure and workplace distancing can therefore be considered as a potential secondary control response in the event of infection quarantine failure and the establishment of community transmission.Our study has several limitations. First, since GeoDEMOS-R is validated against census data, errors exist in our estimations of population features that are based on data that have been sample enumerated. Second, a large population of migrant workers who travel from Malaysia to Singapore each day, visiting tourists, and long-term visa owners were not accounted for in our infection dynamics. Third, the epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19 remain uncertain in terms of the transmission and infectivity profile of the virus; therefore, estimates of the time between symptom onset and admission to hospital, how infectious an individual is over time, and the asymptomatic rate were based on SARS-CoV. Once this information becomes available for COVID-19, a full sensitivity analysis should be done. Fourth, the contact patterns between individuals are highly dynamic and heterogeneous across the population; therefore, our simulated work, school, and home populations serve as a general estimation of infection spread. Fifth, effectiveness of the interventions might vary depending on the ongoing seeding of imported cases, which we did not account for, and will also rely on intervention compliance. Sixth, multiple indirect effects from the interventions and modifications to human behaviour are likely, which are difficult to quantify and measure. The optimum times to implement each intervention and how long they should be run for to achieve long-term epidemic control should be explored. Finally, there are multiple unforeseen factors that remain challenging to assess at this time, such as increased infection rates at mass gatherings, delays in quarantining as a result of individuals not seeking health care at symptom onset, alternate contact events in locations such as public transport, potential transmission events in the health-care setting, and the effects of community-wide behavioural shifts in response to knowledge of the outbreak.Pandemic planning is crucial at the early stages to avert a nationwide outbreak. In this study, we investigated the use of interventions that aim to restrict contact between individuals at important mixing sites: schools, workplaces, and at home. We found that, especially for lower infection scenarios (R0 of 1\u00b75), a combined approach comprising quarantine (for infected individuals and their families), school closure, and workplace distancing is effective and could prevent 99\u00b73% of infections (IQR 92\u00b76\u201399\u00b79) when compared with the baseline scenario. At higher infectivity scenarios, outbreak prevention becomes considerably more challenging because although effective, transmission events still occur: for the combined approach scenario, a median of 50\u2008000 cases were estimated at R0 of 2\u00b70 and 258\u2008000 cases at R0 of 2\u00b75. These combined interventions should therefore be implemented rapidly upon confirmation of second-generation local transmission occurring within the resident population to suppress increases in the national R0. At higher asymptomatic rates, public education and case management become increasingly important, with a need to develop vaccines and existing drug therapies.This online publication has been corrected.

This development has had serious implications for public institutions and raises particular questions for medical schools. Frequent rotations between departments and hospitals make medical students potential vectors for COVID-19. Equally, as trainee doctors we stand to learn a tremendous amount and can contribute to the care of patients. More immediate concerns among medical students centre on the impact of COVID-19 on medical education.A substantial number of medical students are in the process of preparing for or undertaking assessments that require clinical exposure. The effect of COVID-19 on medical education could therefore be considerable. Several teaching hospitals in the UK have reported cases of COVID-19, with some hospitals suspending medical and observership students from attending clinical attachments. This suspension might extend to more hospitals as the COVID-19 pandemic continues to develop, which could lead to clinical medical students receiving reduced exposure in specific specialties, causing a detrimental effect to exam performance and competency as foundation year 1 doctors.\u2022 View related content for this articleThe situation is more complex for some final year medical students who are in the process of sitting their final assessments. Some medical schools have reduced clinical exposure in the weeks coming up to their final exams to reduce the risk of contracting the virus. Many electives could also be cancelled because of the global prevalence of COVID-19. This situation would not only cause financial losses for students, but also lead to a missed opportunity of working in a health-care system outside of the UK. At this stage, it is difficult to predict what will happen, and most medical schools are following advice from Public Health England to determine how to proceed.Despite widespread panic and uncertainty, the medical community must ask itself what history has taught us about medical education during pandemics. To answer this question, we reflect on the effects of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) on medical education in China at the turn of the century.1\nSome Chinese medical schools officially cancelled formal teaching on wards and their exams were delayed, hindering the education of medical students in the face of the newly emerging epidemic.1\nSimilarly, in Canada, the impact of the SARS restrictions led to the cessation of clinical clerkships and electives for students for up to 6 weeks.2\nThe Canadian national residency match felt the effect of these limitations, particularly because electives are one of the most crucial factors determining allocation.1Despite the challenges posed by the SARS epidemic, several resourceful initiatives were implemented, leading to progress in medical education. In one Chinese medical school, online problem-based learning techniques were implemented to complete the curricula; these methods proved incredibly popular, to the extent that they were applied in subsequent years. These impressive feats illuminate how even in times of distress, solace can always be found. We are waiting to see what ingenuities for medical education will emerge in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic.This online publication has been corrected.

The number of cases reported to date is likely to represent an underestimation of the true burden as a result of shortcomings in surveillance and diagnostic capacity affecting case ascertainment in both high-resource and low-resource settings.2\nBy all scientifically meaningful criteria, the world is undergoing a COVID-19 pandemic.In the absence of any pharmaceutical intervention, the only strategy against COVID-19 is to reduce mixing of susceptible and infectious people through early ascertainment of cases or reduction of contact. In The Lancet Infectious Diseases, Joel Koo and colleagues3\nassessed the potential effect of such social distancing interventions on SARS-CoV-2 spread and COVID-19 burden in Singapore. The context is worthy of study, since Singapore was among the first settings to report imported cases, and has so far succeeded in preventing community spread. During the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) outbreak in Singapore, numerous non-pharmaceutical interventions were implemented successfully, including effective triage and infection control measures in health-care settings, isolation and quarantine of patients with SARS and their contacts, and mass screening of school-aged children for febrile illness.4\nEach of these measures represented an escalation of typical public health action. However, the scale and disruptive impact of these interventions were small compared with the measures that have been implemented in China in response to COVID-19, including closure of schools, workplaces, roads, and transit systems; cancellation of public gatherings; mandatory quarantine of uninfected people without known exposure to SARS-CoV-2; and large-scale electronic surveillance.5\n,  6\nAlthough these actions have been praised by WHO,5\nthe possibility of imposing similar measures in other countries raises important questions. Populations for whom social-distancing interventions have been implemented require and deserve assurance that the decision to enact these measures is informed by the best attainable evidence.\u2022 View related content for this articleFor a novel pathogen such as SARS-CoV-2, mathematical modelling of transmission under differing scenarios is the only viable and timely method to generate such evidence. Koo and colleagues3\nadapted an existing influenza epidemic simulation model7\nusing granular data on the composition and behaviour of the population of Singapore to assess the potential consequences of specific social-distancing interventions on the transmission dynamics of SARS-CoV-2. The authors considered three infectivity scenarios (basic reproduction number [R0] of 1\u00b75, 2\u00b70, or 2\u00b75) and assumed between 7\u00b75% and 50\u00b70% of infections were asymptomatic. The interventions were quarantine with or without school closure and workplace distancing (whereby 50% of workers telecommute). Although the complexity of the model makes it difficult to understand the impact of each parameter, the primary conclusions were robust to sensitivity analyses. The combined intervention, in which quarantine, school closure, and workplace distancing were implemented, was the most effective: compared with the baseline scenario of no interventions, the combined intervention reduced the estimated median number of infections by 99\u00b73% (IQR 92\u00b76\u201399\u00b79) when R0 was 1\u00b75, by 93\u00b70% (81\u00b75\u201399\u00b77) when R0 was 2\u00b70, and by 78\u00b72% (59\u00b70\u201394\u00b74) when R0 was 2\u00b75. The observation that the greatest reduction in COVID-19 cases was achieved under the combined intervention is not surprising. However, the assessment of the additional benefit of each intervention, when implemented in combination, offers valuable insight. Since each approach individually will result in considerable societal disruption, it is important to understand the extent of intervention needed to reduce transmission and disease burden.New findings emerge daily about transmission routes and the clinical profile of SARS-CoV-2, including the substantially underestimated rate of infection among children.8\nThe implications of such findings with regard to the authors' conclusions about school closure remain unclear. Additionally, reproductive number estimates for Singapore are not yet available. The authors estimated that 7\u00b75% of infections are clinically asymptomatic, although data on the proportion of infections that are asymptomatic are scarce; as shown by Koo and colleagues in sensitivity analyses with higher asymptomatic proportions, this value will influence the effectiveness of social-distancing interventions. Additionally, the analysis assumes high compliance of the general population, which is not guaranteed.Although the scientific basis for these interventions might be robust, ethical considerations are multifaceted.9\nImportantly, political leaders must enact quarantine and social-distancing policies that do not bias against any population group. The legacies of social and economic injustices perpetrated in the name of public health have lasting repercussions.10\nInterventions might pose risks of reduced income and even job loss, disproportionately affecting the most disadvantaged populations: policies to lessen such risks are urgently needed. Special attention should be given to protections for vulnerable populations, such as homeless, incarcerated, older, or disabled individuals, and undocumented migrants. Similarly, exceptions might be necessary for certain groups, including people who are reliant on ongoing medical treatment.The effectiveness and societal impact of quarantine and social distancing will depend on the credibility of public health authorities, political leaders, and institutions. It is important that policy makers maintain the public's trust through use of evidence-based interventions and fully transparent, fact-based communication.View Large Image\nCopyright \u00a9 2020 Caia Image/Science Photo LibraryWe declare no competing interests.", "S1473-30992030231-0": "The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has now spread to over 100 countries with more than 100\u2008000 laboratory-confirmed cases worldwide.1\n\nHere we describe the first case of COVID-19 in Afghanistan acquired from Iran.A 35-year-old male Afghan shopkeeper visited Qom, Iran, for 1 week beginning Feb 9, 2020. In Iran, he had contact with employees from the shoe company that supplied his shop. He returned to his home in Herat, Afghanistan, by car on Feb 15, 2020, where he spent time with his family and friends without any precautions. On Feb 16, his symptoms began with fever, headache, cough, and dyspnoea. 5 days later, he felt increased concern and decided to visit a private clinic. At the private clinic, he was suspected of COVID-19 as he had recently returned from Iran, where the COVID-19 epidemic has intensified. The patient was referred to the governmental hospital to further investigate COVID-19 disease.\u2022 View related content for this articleOn the day of admission, Feb 22, 2020, the patient reported headache and appeared stressed. A physical examination showed no fever, a pulse of 85 beats per min, blood pressure of 110/70\u2008mm Hg, oxygen saturation at ambient air of 98%, and respiratory rate of 25 breaths per min accompanied with wheezing. On auscultation, a mild crepitation was heard beneath the lungs. No other abnormality was found. There was no specific change on the patient's x-ray (appendix). Full blood count was in the normal range, with a white blood cell count of 7\u00b75\u2008\u00d7\u2008109 cells per L, a haemoglobin concentration of 14\u00b71\u2008g/dL, and a platelet count of 235\u2008\u00d7\u2008109 cells per L. The patient's procalcitonin concentration was 0\u00b721\u2008ng/mL. The fasting blood sugar test, the amount of creatinine and urea in the blood, and the concentration of alanine transaminase and aspartate transaminase were in the normal range. The patient had no underlying medical problems.Molecular assays were done to detect COVID-19 and the confirmed diagnosis was made 3 days after admission. All individuals who had been in close contact with the patient were quarantined at home, and accommodations and vehicles related to the patient were disinfected. Treatment for the patient included ceftriaxone 1\u2008g (vial) every 12 h for 7 days, oseltamivir 75\u2008mg (tablets) every 12 h for 30 days, and terbutaline 10\u2008mg (tablets) every 12 h for 7 days. 17 days from admission, the patient was in good health and a molecular test was done again with a negative result. As of Feb 28, 2020, all people who had been in close contact with the patient appeared to have no symptoms.The weakened public health-care system in Afghanistan, amid widespread poverty and instability, faces a serious challenge, with a looming epidemic at its borders from neighbouring Iran. We stress that all contacts and returning travellers from Iran undergo testing to avoid missing asymptomatic patients, which might result in substanstial chains of transmission throughout Afghanistan.We declare no competing interests.

We previously reported that the viral load of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) peaks within the first week of disease onset.1\n,  2\nFindings from Feb, 2020, indicated that the clinical spectrum of this disease can be very heterogeneous.3\nHere, we report the viral RNA shedding patterns observed in patients with mild and severe COVID-19.76 patients admitted to the First Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University (Nanchang, China) from Jan 21 to Feb 4, 2020, were included in the study. All patients were confirmed to have COVID-19 at the time of admission by RT-PCR. The viral loads of their nasopharyngeal swab samples were estimated with the DCt method (Ctsample \u2013 Ctref). Patients who had any of the following features at the time of, or after, admission were classified as severe cases: (1) respiratory distress (\u226530 breaths per min); (2) oxygen saturation at rest \u226493%; (3) ratio of partial pressure of arterial oxygen to fractional concentration of oxygen inspired air \u2264300 mm Hg; or (4) severe disease complications (eg, respiratory failure, requirement of mechanical ventilation, septic shock, or non-respiratory organ failure). 46 (61%) individuals were classified as mild cases and 30 (39%) were classified as severe cases. The basic demographic data and initial clinical symptoms of these patients are shown in the appendix. Parameters did not differ significantly between the groups, except that patients in the severe group were significantly older than those in the mild group, as expected.4\nNo patient died from the infection. 23 (77%) of 30 severe cases received intensive care unit (ICU) treatment, whereas none of the mild cases required ICU treatment.\u2022 View related content for this articleWe noted that the DCt values of severe cases were significantly lower than those of mild cases at the time of admission (appendix). Nasopharyngeal swabs from both the left and right nasal cavities of the same patient were kept in a sample collection tube containing 3 mL of standard viral transport medium. All samples were collected according to WHO guidelines.5\n\nThe mean viral load of severe cases was around 60 times higher than that of mild cases, suggesting that higher viral loads might be associated with severe clinical outcomes. We further stratified these data according to the day of disease onset at the time of sampling. The DCt values of severe cases remained significantly lower for the first 12 days after onset than those of corresponding mild cases (figure A). We also studied serial samples from 21 mild and ten severe cases (figure B). Mild cases were found to have an early viral clearance, with 90% of these patients repeatedly testing negative on RT-PCR by day 10 post-onset. By contrast, all severe cases still tested positive at or beyond day 10 post-onset. Overall, our data indicate that, similar to SARS in 2002\u201303,6\npatients with severe COVID-19 tend to have a high viral load and a long virus-shedding period.

To date, there has been no evidence of vertical transmission of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) based on two small clinical series.2\n,  3\nAccording to WHO, delayed umbilical cord clamping is highly unlikely to increase the risk of transmitting pathogens from the mother to the fetus even in the case of maternal infection.4\n\nBecause the vernix caseosa contains antimicrobial peptides, we recommend leaving it in place until 24 h after birth.5\n\nNew data examining neonates from infected mothers could be reassuring, but transmission after birth via contact with infectious respiratory secretions is still a concern, and physical separation of mother from child should be considered. Separation is a standard practice in pulmonary tuberculosis and is discussed in cases of maternal influenza infection.6\n\nTherefore, separation of the mother and her newborn baby should be individually discussed by an interdisciplinary team, considering local facilities and risk factors for adverse neonatal outcomes, such as prematurity and fetal distress. Indirect adverse neonatal events stemming from maternal illness due to SARS-CoV-2 were shown in one series.2\nSix of ten infants had abnormal early clinical findings, including respiratory distress, fever, thrombocytopenia, or transaminitis, with one infant death. Although all nine tested infants had negative results for COVID-19 infection, neonatal complications following fetal distress were probably secondary to maternal illness. For these reasons, continued vigilance of mother\u2013infant pairs affected by COVID-19 is warranted. In case of symptom development, newborns should promptly be admitted to a neonatal unit and isolated, with initiation of supportive treatments as needed.COVID-19 was not detected in the maternal milk of six patients.3\nHowever, the primary concern is whether an infected mother can transmit the virus through respiratory droplets during breastfeeding. Breastfeeding during maternal COVID-19 infection is not contraindicated by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,7\n\nand all possible precautions should be taken to avoid spreading the virus to the infant, including washing hands before touching the infant and wearing a face mask if possible.

In January, WHO decided to define the outbreak of COVID-19 as a public health emergency of international concern, which triggered the release of funding and other resources. Despite SARS-CoV-2 now being present in every continent apart from Antartica, WHO remains reluctant to make the next step and call the outbreak a pandemic. On March 5, Tedros Adhamon Ghebreyesus, director-general of WHO, stated that while the outbreak might be uncontrolled in some settings, it is not yet uncontrollable and that would be the threshold to pass for the definition of a pandemic.

The main concern is that calling the outbreak of COVID-19 a pandemic might prompt governments to needlessly or prematurely change their strategies in ways that could undermine their efforts at containment.\u2022 View related content for this articleThese concerns stem from the fact that in outbreak management, two approaches for disease control can be considered: if a pathogen has slow transmission capacity, containment is the approach that permits adoption of measures that limit the spread of a pathogen within well-defined foci (eg, identification and isolation of infected patients, contact tracing, and quarantine of small areas where cases have appeared); by contrast, when a pathogen starts to spread rapidly and there is sustained local transmission, rendering it impossible to isolate all cases, mitigation measures should be put in place with aims such as slowing down the spread of a pathogen within a country or region. Mitigation measures, such as the closure of schools and banning of mass events, specifically aim at avoiding overburdening health systems with an escalation of cases in need of intensive care. The current lockdown of Italy in the face of the rapid increase of COVID-19 cases has this specific goal. The time gained through mitigation measures can potentially also allow the evaluation of new therapeutic options and in the long run the development of a vaccine. WHO's current position is that in most areas containment of COVID-19 is still possible, so a declaration of a pandemic would hamper the commitment of individual countries to put in place rapidly and effectively the required containment measures.Independently from the potential definition of COVID-19 as a pandemic, the spread of SARS-CoV-2 around the world is putting into question the utility of travel bans, strongly opposed by WHO, that some countries have adopted to reduce the risk of introducing the virus in their territories. Banning incoming flights from countries with high numbers of cases of COVID-19 is not a watertight measure because it does not prevent infected individuals from arriving from countries with intermediate numbers where controls are less stringent. In addition, screening travellers for fever using infrared thermometers at airport customs and border checkpoints misses at least 25% of people with fever, making the measure suboptimal for stopping entry of the virus in a country. The fact that SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted by asymptomatic infected people also puts in doubt the value of control measures such as screening at borders. For severe acute respiratory syndrome in 2003, despite extensive controls in airports, not a single case was detected before entering a country.The uncertainty around COVID-19 being a pandemic is causing a disjointed response to the disease among different countries. Declaration of a pandemic, combined with clear and coordinated management guidelines, might help every country limit the impact of the disease and bring it more swiftly under control.View Large Image\nCopyright \u00a9 2020 iStock/Dzyuba", "S1473-30992030195-X": "As of March 1, 2020, 79\u2008968 patients in China and 7169 outside of China had tested positive for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).1\n\nAmong Chinese patients, 2873 deaths had occurred, equivalent to a mortality rate of 3\u00b76% (95% CI 3\u00b75\u20133\u00b77), while 104 deaths from COVID-19 had been reported outside of China (1\u00b75% [1\u00b72\u20131\u00b77]). However, these mortality rate estimates are based on the number of deaths relative to the number of confirmed cases of infection, which is not representative of the actual death rate; patients who die on any given day were infected much earlier, and thus the denominator of the mortality rate should be the total number of patients infected at the same time as those who died. Notably, the full denominator remains unknown because asymptomatic cases or patients with very mild symptoms might not be tested and will not be identified. Such cases therefore cannot be included in the estimation of actual mortality rates, since actual estimates pertain to clinically apparent COVID-19 cases.The maximum incubation period is assumed to be up to 14 days,2\nwhereas the median time from onset of symptoms to intensive care unit (ICU) admission is around 10 days.3\n,  4\nRecently, WHO reported that the time between symptom onset and death ranged from about 2 weeks to 8 weeks.5\u2022 View related content for this articleWe re-estimated mortality rates by dividing the number of deaths on a given day by the number of patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection 14 days before. On this basis, using WHO data on the cumulative number of deaths to March 1, 2020, mortality rates would be 5\u00b76% (95% CI 5\u00b74\u20135\u00b78) for China and 15\u00b72% (12\u00b75\u201317\u00b79) outside of China. Global mortality rates over time using a 14-day delay estimate are shown in the figure, with a curve that levels off to a rate of 5\u00b77% (5\u00b75\u20135\u00b79), converging with the current WHO estimates. Estimates will increase if a longer delay between onset of illness and death is considered. A recent time-delay adjusted estimation indicates that mortality rate of COVID-19 could be as high as 20% in Wuhan, the epicentre of the outbreak.6\nThese findings show that the current figures might underestimate the potential threat of COVID-19 in symptomatic patients.\nFigureGlobal COVID-19 mortality rates (Feb 11 to March 1, 2020)\nShow full caption\nView Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)We declare no competing interests.", "S1473-30992030174-2": "In China, the most common method for diagnosing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is the detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA in throat swabs.

Furthermore, most of these patients do not have sputum, especially during the convalescent period.2\nWe resolved this problem in two patients by inducing sputum production. To our knowledge, this is the first report of such a technique in patients with COVID-19.\u2022 View related content for this articleOur first case was a 54-year-old man with a history of diabetes who was admitted to our hospital (Affiliated Hospital of Guangdong Medical University, Zhanjiang, Guangdong, China) for treatment and quarantine on Feb 1, 2020, because of self-reported fever for the previous 3 days. On admission, his white blood cell count was 6\u00b762\u2008\u00d7\u2008109 per L, lymphocyte count was 2\u00b702\u2008\u00d7\u2008109 per L, C-reactive protein level was 26\u00b76 mg/L (normal range 0\u20138\u00b70 mg/L), and fasting blood glucose level was 12\u00b75 mmol/L. Lung CT showed multiple ground-glass opacities in both lungs and lesions that were primarily distributed along the pleura (appendix pp 1\u20132). On Feb 3, a China Food and Drug Administration-approved viral RNA detection kit confirmed mild COVID-19 in this patient. Symptoms resolved after treatment with oxygen, lopinavir\u2013ritonavir, moxifloxacin, and hypoglycaemic drugs. 3 days later, the patient's fever decreased and C-reactive protein levels normalised. After four follow-up lung CT scans, the patient's lungs showed substantial lesion resorption (appendix pp 1\u20132). Beginning Feb 13, three consecutive throat swabs (>24 h intervals) and one anal swab tested negative for viral RNA. On Feb 21, induced sputum (ie, 10 mL of 3% hypertonic saline was inhaled through a mask with oxygen at a flow rate of 6 L/min for 20 min or until the sputum was produced) was positive for viral RNA.Our second case was a 42-year-old woman who was admitted to our hospital on Jan 27, 2020, because of self-reported fever for the previous 4 days. On admission, her white blood cell count was 4\u00b701\u2008\u00d7\u2008109/L, lymphocyte count was 0\u00b771\u2008\u00d7\u2008109/L, and C-reactive protein level was 2\u00b758 mg/L. Lung CT showed scattered inflammation in both lungs and lesions that were primarily distributed along the pleura (appendix pp 1\u20132). On Jan 28, viral RNA was detected in a throat swab, confirming a mild case of COVID-19. Her fever subsided the day after treatment with oxygen, lopinavir\u2013ritonavir, and moxifloxacin, and her symptoms gradually resolved. After four follow-up lung CT scans, her lungs showed lesion resorption and improvement (appendix pp 1\u20132). Beginning Feb 10, three consecutive throat swabs (>24 h intervals) and one anal swab tested negative for viral RNA. On Feb 21, we induced 3 mL of sputum, as described before for our first case, and viral RNA was detected.Sputum induction is a safe and simple non-invasive method for detecting various lung diseases.3\nMoreover, the risk of medical staff exposure to COVID-19 is lower with sputum induction than with nasal or throat swabs and bronchoalveolar lavage methods. Here we showed sputum induction might be more helpful than throat swabs for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in convalescent patients; to confirm our findings, more patients should be tested using this method to further test its viability for clinical application. Our study also showed that patients with COVID-19 might be contagious despite being clinically cured and having multiple negative throat swabs. To reduce the risk of disease spread, viral RNA tests of induced sputum\u2014not throat swabs\u2014should be assessed as a criterion for releasing COVID-19 patients.This online publication has been corrected.

Person-to-person transmission of SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), started in December, 2019, in Wuhan, China and has spread to become a global pandemic, with, as of Feb 26, 2020, community transmission in Italy, Iran, and South Korea.Modelling studies have aided understanding of COVID-19 dynamics from the first announcement of the epidemic and publication of the genetic sequence of the causative virus. Initial phylogenetic analysis of closely related viruses suggested highly linked person-to-person spread of SARS-CoV-2 originating from mid-November to early December, 2019.1\n,  2\nFollowing this, modellers provided simple calculations that identified a mismatch between reported cases in China and reported importations of cases from travellers. Based on travel volumes, modellers inferred3\nthat cases in Wuhan were underestimated by a factor of 40\u2014a crucially important finding. Further calculations, again based on travel volumes, suggested that some countries would be expected to have many more travel-related cases than had been notified,4\ndrawing attention to the possibility of undetected cases and community transmission in several countries.\u2022 View related content for this articleTransmission dynamic models are a necessary first step in understanding the pandemic potential of an emerging infectious disease, including estimating the reproduction number\u2014the number of new cases arising from a typical infected case. The first published transmission dynamic study of COVID-19 was rapid and uncomplicated, estimating the basic reproduction number as time-invariant5\nwithout exploring some of the major underlying assumptions, such as lack of infectiousness during the incubation period. Since this early publication, many estimates for the reproduction rate have appeared, ranging from around 2 to more than 6.6In The Lancet Infectious Diseases, the study by Adam Kucharski and colleagues7\naddresses many of the assumptions of earlier works. The report contributes a time-varying reproduction number, showing the effect of the massive public health interventions put in place by China from Jan 23, 2020. By using additional datasets of travel-related exported cases, Kucharski and colleagues do not rely entirely on notified cases in Wuhan, which are likely to bias estimates caused by changes in case detection over time. The authors show that the reproduction number fell almost to the threshold value of 1 during the unprecedented public health restrictions in China.7Kucharski and colleagues7\nsuggest that chains of transmission might not take off initially and might require up to four imported cases to establish transmission. This estimate assumes that SARS-CoV-2 has heterogeneity of infectiousness similar to SARS, which was characterised by a number of super-spreaders with most cases infecting no other people. If SARS-CoV-2 has a more homogenous infectiousness profile (to which emerging evidence is pointing) in which most people infect two to three others, the risk of established local transmission with a single imported case is considerably higher.This study answers\u2014at least in one location over a restricted time\u2014a critical question regarding this emerging pandemic, its reproduction number.7\nThis crucial number began at 2\u00b735 and declined to 1\u00b705 over the course of December, 2019, and January, 2020. Many questions remain unanswered and should be addressed with urgency, including the infectiousness of cases over the duration of their illness\u2014particularly how much transmission could occur from people who are unaware that they have illness, including asymptomatic and mildly symptomatic people. Initial reports suggest that live virus can be recovered from asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic people,3\nwhich is of great concern as it will make disease much harder to detect and therefore control. However, what contribution such people make to the overall epidemic is unknown. Additionally, the infection severity, including the infection-fatality rate across different ages and risk groups, must be established. Early reports provide estimates of case fatality of 2\u00b73% within China.8\n\nHowever, it is notoriously difficult to make such estimates early in an outbreak,9\nand it is clear that not all infections become cases and studies of many tiers of severity (deaths measured as a proportion of hospitalisations, notified cases and syndromic surveillance, and even potentially serosurveillance testing when available) will be needed to establish infection-fatality rates.Ongoing modelling and surveillance should continue at the epicentre of the pandemic in mainland China to assess the effect of public health measures. However, attention must also move to the emerging foci outside of China, including Italy, Iran, and South Korea, to determine if the reproduction ratio might vary in different climates and sociological contexts. New foci of infection across different continents change the risk to global communities, as this coronavirus becomes a pandemic.View Large Image\nCopyright \u00a9 2020 Flickr/Dipartimento Protezione CivileI declare no competing interests.", "S1473-30992030144-4": "Background\nAn outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has led to 95\u2008333 confirmed cases as of March 5, 2020.

The four datasets we fitted to were: daily number of new internationally exported cases (or lack thereof), by date of onset, as of Jan 26, 2020; daily number of new cases in Wuhan with no market exposure, by date of onset, between Dec 1, 2019, and Jan 1, 2020; daily number of new cases in China, by date of onset, between Dec 29, 2019, and Jan 23, 2020; and proportion of infected passengers on evacuation flights between Jan 29, 2020, and Feb 4, 2020 (appendix p 3). We used an additional two datasets for comparison with model outputs: daily number of new exported cases from Wuhan (or lack thereof) in countries with high connectivity to Wuhan (ie, top 20 most at-risk countries), by date of confirmation, as of Feb 10, 2020; and data on new confirmed cases reported in Wuhan between Jan 16, 2020, and Feb 11, 2020 (appendix p 3).In the model, we divided individuals into four infection classes, as follows: susceptible, exposed (but not yet infectious), infectious, and removed (ie, isolated, recovered, or otherwise no longer infectious; figure 1). The model accounted for delays in symptom onset and reporting by including compartments to reflect transitions between reporting states and disease states. The model also incorporated uncertainty in case observation, by explicitly modelling a Poisson observed process of newly symptomatic cases, reported onsets of new cases, reported confirmation of cases, and a binomial observation process for infection prevalence on evacuation flights (appendix pp 1\u20133). The incubation period was assumed to be Erlang distributed with mean 5\u00b72 days14\n(SD 3\u00b77) and delay from onset to isolation was assumed to be Erlang distributed with mean 2\u00b79 days (2\u00b71).2\n\n,  15\nThe delay from onset to reporting was assumed to be exponentially distributed with mean 6\u00b71 days (2\u00b75).2\n\nOnce exposed to infection, a proportion of individuals travelled internationally and we assumed that the probability of cases being exported from Wuhan to a specific other country depended on the number of cases in Wuhan, the number of outbound travellers (assumed to be 3300 per day before travel restrictions were introduced on Jan 23, 2020, and zero after), the relative connectivity of different countries,16\n\nand the relative probability of reporting a case outside Wuhan, to account for differences in clinical case definition, detection, and reporting within Wuhan and internationally.

The model had three unknown parameters, which we estimated: magnitude of temporal variability in transmission, proportion of cases that would eventually be detectable, and relative probability of reporting a confirmed case within Wuhan compared with an internationally exported case that originated in Wuhan. We assumed the outbreak started with a single infectious case on Nov 22, 2019, and the entire population was initially susceptible. Once we had estimated Rt, we used a branching process with a negative binomial offspring distribution to calculate the probability an introduced case would cause a large outbreak. We also did a sensitivity analysis on the following three key assumptions: we assumed the initial number of cases was ten rather than one; we assumed connectivity between countries followed WorldPop rather than MOBS Lab estimates; and we assumed that cases were infectious during the second half of their incubation period rather than only being infectious while symptomatic.

The model captured the exponential growth in case onsets in early January, the rising number of exported case onsets between Jan 15, and Jan 23, 2020, and the prevalence of infection measured on ten evacuation flights from Wuhan to seven countries. We estimated that 94\u00b78% (95% CI 93\u00b71\u201396\u00b71%) of the Wuhan population were still susceptible on Jan 31, 2020 (figure 2). Our results suggested there were around ten times more symptomatic cases in Wuhan in late January than were reported as confirmed cases (figure 2), but the model did not predict the slowdown in cases that was observed in early February. The model could also reproduce the pattern of confirmed exported cases from Wuhan, which was not explicitly used in the model fitting (figure 2). We found that confirmed and estimated exported cases among the 20 countries most connected to China generally corresponded with each other, with the USA and Australia as notable outliers, having had more confirmed cases reported with a travel history to Wuhan than would be expected in the model (figure 2). There was evidence that the majority of cases were symptomatic. We estimated that 100% (95% CI 51\u2013100) of cases would eventually have detectable symptoms, implying that most infections that were exported internationally from Wuhan in late January were in theory eventually detectable. As a sensitivity analysis, we repeated the analysis with a large number of initial cases, different mobility data, and the assumption that pre-symptomatic cases could transmit. In these analyses, we observed the same result of a decline in Rt from more than 2 to almost 1 in the last 2 weeks of January, 2020 (appendix pp 10\u201313).To examine the potential for new outbreaks to establish in locations outside Wuhan, we used our estimates of the Rt to simulate new outbreaks with potential individual-level variation in transmission (ie, so called superspreading events).17\n,  18\n,  19\nSuch variation increases the fragility of transmission chains, making it less likely that an outbreak will take hold following a single introduction. If transmission is more homogeneous, with all infectious individuals generating a similar number of secondary cases, it is more likely than an outbreak will establish.18\nBased on the median Rt estimated during January before travel restrictions were introduced, we estimated that a single introduction of SARS-CoV-2 with SARS-like or Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-like individual-level variation in transmission would have a 17% to 25% probability of causing a large outbreak (figure 3). Assuming SARS-like variation and Wuhan-like transmission, we estimated that once four or more infections have been introduced into a new location, there is an over 50% chance that an outbreak will occur (figure 3).\nFigure 3Risk that introduced infections will establish in a new population\nShow full caption\nView Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Combining a mathematical model with multiple datasets, we found that the median daily Rt of SARS-CoV-2 in Wuhan probably varied between 1\u00b76 and 2\u00b76 in January, 2020, before travel restrictions were introduced. We also estimated that transmission declined by around half in the 2 weeks spanning the introduction of restrictions.The estimated fluctuations in Rt were driven by the rise and fall in the number of cases, both in Wuhan and internationally, as well as prevalence on evacuation flights. Such fluctuations could be the result of changes in behaviour in the population at risk, or specific superspreading events that inflated the average estimate of transmission.17\n,  18\n,  19\nWe found some evidence of a reduction in Rt in the days before the introduction of travel restrictions in Wuhan, which might have reflected outbreak control efforts or growing awareness of SARS-CoV-2 during this period. The uncertainty in our estimates for Rt following the decline in early February, 2020, results from a paucity of data sources to inform changes in transmission during this period.Comparing model predictions with observed confirmed cases reported in Wuhan, we found that the model predicted at least ten times higher cases than were reported in early February, 2020. The model also did not predict the more recent slowdown in cases, suggesting that transmission might have declined more than our model\u2014which did not fit to this case data\u2014estimated during early February, 2020. Our estimates for international cases in specific countries were broadly consistent with the number of subsequently confirmed exported cases outside Wuhan. However, there were notably more cases exported to France, USA, and Australia compared with what our model predicted. This could be the result of increased surveillance and detection as awareness of SARS-CoV-2 increased in late January, which would suggest earlier exported cases might have been missed, or could be the result of increased travel out of Wuhan immediately before introduction of travel restrictions on Jan 23, 2020.Based our on estimated reproduction number and published estimates of individual-level variation in transmission for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, we found that a single case introduced to a new location would not necessarily lead to an outbreak. Even if the reproduction number is as high as in Wuhan in early January, it could take several introductions for an outbreak to establish, because high individual-level variation in transmission makes new chains of transmission more fragile, and hence it becomes less likely that a single infection will generate an outbreak. This factor highlights the importance of rapid case identification and subsequent isolation and other control measures to reduce the chance of onward chains of transmission.20Our analysis highlights the value of combining multiple data sources in analysis of COVID-19. For example, the rapid growth of confirmed cases globally during late January, 2020, with case totals in some instances apparently doubling every day or so, would have had the effect of inflating Rt estimates to implausibly large values if only these recent datapoints were used in our analysis. Our results also have implications for estimation of transmission dynamics using the number of exported cases from a specific area.21\nOnce extensive travel restrictions are introduced, as they were in Wuhan, the signal from such data gets substantially weaker. If restrictions and subsequent delays in detection of cases are not accounted for, this could lead to artificially low estimates of Rt or inferred case totals from the apparently declining numbers of exported cases. Our model estimates benefited from the availability of testing data from evacuation flights, which allowed us to estimate current prevalence. Having such information for other settings, either through widespread testing or serological surveillance, will be valuable to reduce reliance on case reports alone.There are several other limitations to our analysis. We used plausible biological parameters for SARS-CoV-2 based on current evidence, but these values might be refined as more comprehensive data become available. However, by fitting to multiple datasets to infer model parameters, and conducting sensitivity analyses on key areas of uncertainty, we have attempted to make the best possible use of the available evidence about SARS-CoV-2 transmission dynamics. Furthermore, we used publicly available connectivity and risk estimates based on international travel data to predict the number of cases exported into each country. These estimates have shown good correspondence with the distribution of exported cases to date,22\nand are similar to another risk assessment for COVID-19 with different data.23\nWe also assumed that the latent period is equal to the incubation period (ie, individuals become infectious and symptomatic at the same time) and all infected individuals will eventually become symptomatic. However, there is evidence that transmission of SARS-CoV-2 can occur with few reported symptoms.24\nTherefore, we did a sensitivity analysis in which transmission could occur in the second half of the incubation period, but this did not change our overall conclusions of a decline in Rt from around 2\u00b74 to almost 1 during the last 2 weeks of January. We also explored having a larger initial spillover event and using different sources for flight connectivity data, both of which produced the same conclusion about the decline in transmission. In our analysis of new outbreaks, we also used estimates of individual-level variation in transmission for SARS and MERS-CoV to illustrate potential dynamics. However, it remains unclear what the precise extent of such variation is for SARS-CoV-2.17\nIf transmission were more homogenous than SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV, it would increase the risk of outbreaks following introduced cases. As more data become available, it will be possible to refine these estimates; therefore we have made an online tool so that users can explore these risk estimates if new data become available (appendix p 4).Our results show that there was probably substantial variation in SARS-CoV-2 transmission over time, and suggest a decline in transmission in Wuhan in late January, 2020, around the time that control measures were introduced. If COVID-19 transmission is established outside Wuhan, understanding the effectiveness of control measures in different settings will be crucial for understanding the dynamics of the outbreak, and the likelihood that transmission can eventually be contained or effectively mitigated.ContributorsData analysis was led by AJK, who programmed the model with help from TWR.

On presentation, his temperature was 38\u00b71\u00b0C. Laboratory tests showed a C-reactive protein concentration of 0\u00b756 mg/dL (normal range 0\u00b700\u20130\u00b760] mg/dL). Complete blood count showed elevated leukocytes (10\u2008060 cells per \u03bcL [normal range 3500\u20139500 cells per \u03bcL]), neutrophils (7550 cells per \u03bcL [1800\u20136300 cells per \u03bcL]), and monocytes (990 cells per \u03bcL [100\u2013600 cells per \u03bcL]), while the lymphocyte count (1490 cells per \u03bcL) was in the normal range (1100\u20133200 cells per \u03bcL). The patient was negative for influenza A and B viruses, adenovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, and parainfluenza 1, 2, and 3 viruses. Chest CT showed multiple ground-glass opacities in the lower lobes bilaterally.The patient was given antibacterial, antiviral, and corticosteroid treatments (moxifloxacin [0\u00b74 g/day] for 5 days, followed by ribavirin [0\u00b75 g/day] and methylprednisolone [40 mg/day] for 5 days) via intravenous drop infusion. However, after 10 days, the patient had persistent fever (highest temperature 38\u00b75\u00b0C), cough, and shortness of breath. The patient was diagnosed with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on the basis of RT-PCR analysis of sputum samples. On day 11, the patient developed exertional angina with cardiac palpitations along with respiratory wheezing. Chest CT revealed multiple ground-glass opacities with bilateral parenchymal consolidation and interlobular septal thickening. Spontaneous pneumomediastinum and subcutaneous emphysema were also observed (figure).\nFigureChest CT showed spontaneous pneumomediastinum (arrow), subcutaneous emphysema, and bilateral ground-glass opacities of the lung\nView Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Corticosteroid treatment was stopped, while ribavirin was continued at the same dosage for 14 days. Supplemental oxygen, antibiotics, antitussives, and bronchodilators were also added to the regimen, which included theophylline (0\u00b72 g/12 h), ambroxol (45 mg/12 h), and cefoperazone\u2013tazobactam (2 g/8 h) via intravenous drip infusion, as well as recombinant human interferon alfa-1b via aerosol (three times daily) for 14 days.\u2022 View related content for this articleBy day 25, the patient's temperature had recovered to normal (36\u00b75\u00b0C), his cough had improved, and his breathing was normal. RT-PCR analysis of COVID-19 was negative. Chest CT revealed resolution of previous pneumomediastinum and a reduction of parenchymal consolidation with pulmonary fibrosis and pneumatocele in the inferior left lower lobe. Repeat RT-PCR was negative on day 30, and the patient was discharged for outpatient follow-up.Although the precise mechanism of pneumomediastinum is unknown, spontaneous pneumomediastinum is usually a self-limiting disease. However, it can potentially cause severe circulatory and respiratory pathology. Therefore, the occurrence of spontaneous pneumomediastinum in COVID-19 patients should be monitored closely as a potential indicator of worsening disease.ContributorsCZ and CG contributed to data analysis, data interpretation, the literature search, and manuscript drafting.

In December, 2019, a novel coronavirus, named SARS-CoV-2, emerged in Wuhan, China, and led to a rapidly spreading outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). By Jan 30, 2020, COVID-19 was declared a public health emergency of international concern. The similarities between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are striking, not only in name. The whole genome of SARS-CoV-2 has a 86% similarity with SARS-CoV.1\nBoth viruses share high degrees of homology to SARS-like coronaviruses isolated in bats, suggesting that bats are the probable origin of both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. Live animal markets selling multiple species of wild and domestic animals in proximity to large populations of densely housed humans are thought to be the source of both outbreaks. Even in terms of disease dynamics there are apparent similarities. The main transmission route is thought to be respiratory droplets, although viral shedding via faeces has also been reported for both viruses. The angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), found in the lower respiratory tract of humans, has been identified as the receptor used for cell entry for both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.2\n,  3\nCOVID-19 and SARS have a median incubation time of about 5 days. The mean serial interval of COVID-19 is 7\u00b75 days (95% CI 5\u00b73\u201319\u00b70) and the initial estimate for the basic number (R0) was 2\u00b72 (95% CI 1\u00b74\u20133\u00b79),4\nsimilar to that reported for SARS (mean serial interval 8\u00b74 days, and basic R0 range 2\u00b72\u20133\u00b76 for serial intervals of 8\u201312 days).5\nRisk factors for severe disease outcomes are old age and comorbidities. The progression for patients with severe disease follows a similar pattern in both viruses, with progression to acute respiratory distress syndrome approximately 8\u201320 days after onset of first symptoms, whereby lung abnormalities on chest CT show greatest severity approximately 10 days after initial onset of symptoms.6\n,  7\n,  8\n,  9However, the similarities end here. The epidemic trajectory looks different. The SARS epidemic in 2003 reported 8098 cases with 774 deaths, and was eventually brought under control by July, 2003, in a matter of 8 months. Although 26 countries reported cases, the vast majority of cases were concentrated in five countries or regions: China, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Singapore, and Toronto, Canada. SARS was eventually contained by means of syndromic surveillance, prompt isolation of patients, strict enforcement of quarantine of all contacts, and in some areas community-level quarantine. By interrupting all human-to-human transmission, SARS was effectively eradicated. By contrast, by Feb 28, 2020, within a matter of 2 months since the beginning of the outbreak, more than 82\u2008000 confirmed cases of COVID-19 have been reported with more than 2800 deaths, mostly in China. Outside of China, 46 countries are reporting more than 3600 cases including at least 700 on several cruise ships.Key messages\n\u2022\nThere are many similarities between severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) from the virus homology to the origin and transmission routes.\n\u2022\nSARS was effectively eradicated by implementing top-down draconic measures to halt all human-to-human transmission.\n\u2022\nTraditional public health measures used during SARS were successful and included active case detection, isolation of cases, contact tracing and quarantine of all contacts, social distancing, and community quarantine.\n\u2022\nWhether these measures will also be successful for COVID-19 will not depend on the similarities but the differences between SARS and COVID-19.\n\u2022\nClear differences are emerging, such as in transmissibility and severity pyramids; COVID-19 has a higher transmissibility than SARS, and many more patients with COVID-19 rather than SARS have mild symptoms that contribute to spread because these patients are often missed and not isolated.\n\u2022\nBecause of the extent of community spread, traditional public health measures might not be able to halt all human-to-human transmission, and we need to consider moving from containment to mitigation.\u2022\nThere are many similarities between severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) from the virus homology to the origin and transmission routes.\n\u2022\nSARS was effectively eradicated by implementing top-down draconic measures to halt all human-to-human transmission.\n\u2022\nTraditional public health measures used during SARS were successful and included active case detection, isolation of cases, contact tracing and quarantine of all contacts, social distancing, and community quarantine.\n\u2022\nWhether these measures will also be successful for COVID-19 will not depend on the similarities but the differences between SARS and COVID-19.\n\u2022\nClear differences are emerging, such as in transmissibility and severity pyramids; COVID-19 has a higher transmissibility than SARS, and many more patients with COVID-19 rather than SARS have mild symptoms that contribute to spread because these patients are often missed and not isolated.\n\u2022\nBecause of the extent of community spread, traditional public health measures might not be able to halt all human-to-human transmission, and we need to consider moving from containment to mitigation.Traditional public health measures were widely used to eradicate SARS. Can COVID-19 be controlled by these same measures? It is crucial to remember what measures were taken, and which lessons could be applicable to COVID-19.In the absence of vaccines and specific treatment, the only available public health tools to control person-to-person transmittable diseases are isolation and quarantine, social distancing, and community containment measures.10Isolation is the separation of ill people from non-infected people, and usually occurs in hospital settings, but could also be done at home for mild infections.11\nFor isolation to be successful in preventing transmission, case detection should be early\u2014ie, before the onset of viral shedding or at least before the onset of peak viral shedding. For SARS, viral loads peaked at 6\u201311 days after onset of illness for nasopharyngeal aspirates, enabling early isolation before transmission.12\nThe number of secondary cases from an infected patient was clearly reduced if the infected patient was isolated within 4 days after onset of symptoms.13\nFor SARS, a highly sensitive case definition was used with a focus on fever or respiratory symptoms, and an epidemiological link (contact or travel history). All suspected patients were isolated until SARS was ruled out. Implementing optimal isolation by itself was modelled to be more cost-effective than implementing suboptimal isolation and quarantine together.14\nSecondary household transmission was low in Singapore (6\u00b72%), indicative of rapid detection and isolation of patients. Similarly, in Toronto, secondary attack rate in households was 10%, with a linear association between secondary attack rate and the time that the index patient spent at home after symptom onset.15\nIn Singapore, health-care-associated transmission accounted for more than 90% of all cases.16\nOnce full measures were in place, almost all patients were promptly isolated before secondary transmission had occurred. The outbreak in Singapore was propagated by five superspreading events,16\nincluding three superspreading events as a result of atypical clinical manifestations of SARS.17Quarantine involves movement restriction, ideally combined with medical observation during the quarantine period, of close contacts of infected patients during the incubation period.18\nThe premise for successful quarantine is prompt and comprehensive contact tracing of each and every confirmed patient. Quarantine can take place at home or in designated places such as hotels, and both of these options were used during the SARS epidemic. Quarantined contacts had to record their temperatures, and were visited or telephoned daily by a member of the public health-care team. If the contact developed symptoms, they were investigated at a designated health-care facility. The principle is that if the person under quarantine developed illness, that person would not have any close contacts to spread the disease, effectively reducing the R0 of the outbreak to less than 1. As an example of the magnitude of efforts taken, Toronto Public Health investigated 2132 potential cases of SARS and identified 23\u2008103 contacts as requiring quarantine.19\nLegally enforceable quarantine orders were issued to contacts. Police made spot checks in Hong Kong whereas video cameras were installed at the home of each contact in Singapore.16\n,  20Once it is no longer feasible to identify all infectious individuals and their contacts in the attempt to slow the spread of disease, a possible next step is to apply community-wide containment measures. Community-wide containment is an intervention that is applied to an entire community, city, or region, designed to reduce personal interactions.10\nThese interventions range from measures to encourage personal responsibility to identify disease, increase social distancing among community members including cancellation of public gatherings, and finally implement community quarantine.11\nEnforcement of community-wide containment measures is far more complex than isolation or quarantine because of the larger number of people involved. China best exemplified this large-scale quarantine by declaring epidemic zones and placing people under collective quarantine in villages, cities, or institutions.21\nIn April 2003, the Chinese authorities gained full control of all activities to combat SARS, with guidelines and control measures that were national, unambiguous, rational, and widely followed, under central guidance. The stringent control measures included school closures and closures of all universities and public places, as well as the cancellation of the public holiday in May. Immediately, the R0 decreased greatly and consistently.22\nIn May, 2003, China locked down Beijing and closed more than 3500 public places in an effort to curb community spread.Singapore became the so-called country of thermometers: temperature monitoring was made mandatory in schools and temperature screening was instituted at entry to public buildings. Case detection was further improved by the opening of hundreds of fever clinics and use of the mass media to encourage people to check for fever several times a day. Citizens with higher degrees of anxiety, better knowledge about SARS, and greater risk perceptions than average were more likely to take comprehensive precautionary measures against the infection.23\nIn Hong Kong, 49% of the patients with SARS were in clinics, hospitals, and elderly or nursing homes. The Amoy Gardens cluster accounted for another 18\u00b78% of cases; these affected areas were put on community quarantine.24\nAwareness about SARS was very high, and there was an extraordinarily high willingness (90% of respondents in a psychobehavioural study in Singapore and Hong Kong) to be quarantined if deemed necessary.23\nThere was a strong political will in all affected countries with a top-down approach to enforce all public health measures in a short timeframe. In mainland China, the strong political commitment with a centrally coordinated response was considered the most important factor in the control of SARS.22Hospital-based measures included isolation rooms with barrier nursing techniques, strict enforcement of personal protective equipment for staff, and restriction of visitors and movement of staff. Negative pressure rooms were not used, or only used when available. Infection control precautions were enhanced in all hospitals, and included the provision of separate triage facilities for patients with fever or respiratory symptoms. In Toronto and Singapore, workers were required to use gloves, gowns, eye protection, and N95 respirators for all contact with all patients, regardless of whether SARS was suspected or not.19\nTo reduce within-hospital spread, hospitals banned all visitors to patients with SARS except on compassionate grounds.19\nHealth-care workers or visitors exposed to facilities where SARS transmission had occurred were not permitted to enter non-SARS areas.25\nIn Singapore, temperature screening was mandated twice daily for all health-care workers.26\nHealth-care workers who developed a fever had to report to a designated health-care facility, and were isolated until SARS was ruled out. To accommodate the large number of patients with SARS (both probable and suspect), Beijing rapidly constructed the 1000-bed Xiaotangshan hospital within a week, which admitted a seventh of SARS patients in the country within 2 months.Following the WHO global alert, and a stronger emergency travel advisory issued by WHO on March 15, 2003, almost all countries with imported cases were able to either prevent any further transmission or keep the number of additional cases small. Exit screening via thermal scanners was done for all departing passengers at all airports of affected countries. Many countries also implemented entry screening for all passengers arriving from affected areas. After all these measures were implemented, new imported cases of SARS did not trigger new outbreaks as systems were in place to identify and isolate them early.27\nNo travel bans were implemented at any time, but travel advisories to avoid non-essential travel to countries affected by SARS were issued by several governments. The psychological effects of SARS, coupled with travel restrictions imposed by various national and international authorities, resulted in a major economic loss for the airline industry and world economy in 2003, far beyond the main areas affected by SARS.2817 years later, we can draw upon the lessons learnt from SARS. The global community is much better prepared now, with many capacity-building initiatives including those under the WHO's International Health Regulations (2005). Indeed, the time interval from the first case description to the virus sequencing and the availability of diagnostic assays was much faster for COVID-19 than for SARS, and diagnostic tests were available globally within 2 weeks of reports of cases from China. Organisations such as the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations, and the Global Research Collaboration For Infectious Disease Preparedness, supported by the WHO Research Blueprint and its Global Coordinating Mechanism, were able to accelerate the outbreak response and rapidly initiate technical platforms for the development of vaccines and therapeutics.29\nStandardised data collection tools were distributed and used within a matter of weeks, and the first clinical trials for therapeutic interventions was initiated in January.30\nChina has higher medical standards, a better educated health-care workforce, and more technical and scientific expertise now than in 2003. China's current response contains much more transparency and decisive action, which was initiated much earlier in the current outbreak than in the 2003 outbreak.31So why have the case numbers of COVID-19 already surpassed those of SARS by Jan 30, 2020?There are several explanations. First, the situation is different. Wuhan, the epicentre of COVID-19, combines multiple elements that make containment challenging. As the largest city (>11 million) in central China, Wuhan is a major transport hub and centre for industry and commerce, home to the largest train station, biggest airport, and largest deep-water port in central China.32\nChina's outward travel has more than doubled in the past decade, and its urban population densities possibly even tripled. The proximity of people in residential housing, during commute, and in work environments in a megacity such as Wuhan amplifies person-to-person transmission. The sheer population size is the single biggest challenge. Hospitals were initially overwhelmed by the number of patients, and many patients were not hospitalised because of a shortage of hospital beds, thereby contributing to seeding in the community. A new hospital was built within 10 days. A massive banquet with 40\u2008000 guests took place just before the lockdown, further exacerbating community spread. Worse, in the days just before Wuhan was put under lockdown, more than 5 million people (many of whom might have been incubating the virus) had travelled out because of the upcoming Spring Festival, thus spreading COVID-19 to other provinces in China. The high connectivity of Wuhan to international airports further facilitated rapid spread to cities and countries with high air passenger volumes from China, such as Singapore, Japan, and Thailand.33\n,  34A second explanation might be that the infectious period is different. Isolation was effective for SARS because peak viral shedding occurred after patients were already quite ill with respiratory symptoms and could be easily identified. Although asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic patients have been reported for SARS,35\nno known transmission occurred from these patients. By contrast, preliminary evidence from exported COVID-19 cases suggest that transmission during the early phase of illness also seems to contribute to overall transmission;36\n,  37\ntherefore, isolation of more severely ill patients at the time of presentation to health-care facilities will be too late. The effectiveness of isolation and contact tracing methods depends on the proportion of transmission that occurs before symptom onset. Pre-symptomatic transmission will also make temperature screening less effective.38A third explanation could be that the transmissibility might be higher for COVID-19 than for SARS. R0 is a central concept in infectious disease epidemiology, indicating the risk of an infectious agent with respect to its epidemic potential. A recent review (published in February, 2020) found the average R0 of COVID-19 to be 3\u00b728 and median R0 to be 2\u00b779, higher than that of SARS, although more accurate estimates can only be ascertained when the epidemic stablises.39\nThe speed of spread of COVID-19\u2014from the first documented case in early December, 2019, to 80\u2008000 cases by the end of February, 2020, despite massive containment efforts\u2014is certainly much faster than that reported for SARS between November, 2002, and March, 2003, before any forms of containment were even instituted. The high attack rates on the cruise ship Diamond Princess in Japan, with more than 700 on board infected out of approximately 3700 cruise ship passengers and crew members by Feb 28, 2020, despite public health measures, suggest a very high transmissibility.40A fourth explanation is that the clinical spectrum is different. China's initial case definition was focused on pneumonia, and initial case fatality rates (CFR) were reported at about 10% on the basis of this narrow case definition.6\nHowever, as the epidemic unfolds, it has become apparent that mild cases are common in COVID-19. Patients with mild disease manifestations will be missed even if a more sensitive surveillance system were in place, and these patients might spread the disease silently, similar to influenza. On Feb 18, 2020, the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention published their data of the first 72\u2008314 patients including 44\u2008672 patients with confirmed COVID-19.41\n\nAs many as 81% of the patients with confirmed COVID-19 were reported to have a mild disease or less severe forms of pneumonia, whereas 13\u00b78% had a severe condition and 4\u00b77% were critically ill. The study also noted that nearly half (49%) of the critically ill patients have died. Of the patients from the Diamond Princess cruise ship, which provides a captive cohort to study the virus, more than 10% were asymptomatic upon diagnosis. Estimating CFRs remains elusive, as many patients are still in the early stages of disease, and more fatalities could occur given that death seems to occur 2\u20134 weeks after onset of symptoms.6\n,  7\nThe current estimate by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention is a CFR of 2\u00b73%, with increasing CFRs for patients with advanced age or comorbidities. However, the report also shows that CFRs vary greatly between Wuhan and other provinces in China; therefore some uncertainty remains around CFRs. With already more than 3600 cases imported into or acquired in other countries (or on cruise ships), more information on the full spectrum of disease and a better estimate of the CFR should be available in the next few weeks. Of note is that even if the CFR of COVID-19 (possibly <2%) is far lower than that of SARS (10%), this is not reassuring, as a highly transmissible disease with low CFR will result in many more cases, and therefore also ultimately more deaths than SARS.A fifth explanation is that community spread is more prominent. Whereas SARS was mainly an outbreak propagated within hospitals, widespread community transmission is already evident for COVID-19. By Feb 28, 2020, more than 82\u2008000 cases had been reported. Some models indicate that several hundred thousand infections might already exist in China. Consequently, there will be more unknown contacts than known contacts in the community, which means that many contacts who will subsequently develop an infection are not quarantined and under proper medical observation. Hence, China decided to enforce the most drastic of all classic public health measures: community containment with social distancing, community use of facemasks, and a lockdown of Wuhan's public transportation, including buses, trains, ferries, and airport. As the community-based outbreak spread, the lockdown was extended to more than 60 million residents in more than 20 cities by Jan 30, 2020. China has essentially issued the largest quarantine in history to prevent its spread to the rest of the world. By Jan 30, 2020, 113\u2008579 close contacts have been tracked and a total of 102\u2008427 people were receiving medical observation. This approach is an unprecedented gigantic effort that surpasses all efforts done during SARS.The gigantic efforts come at a cost to travel and trade, to China's economy and beyond, let alone the mental health of millions of people under lockdown. These sacrifices are being made because the memories of SARS fuel hope that containment is feasible. Whether these rigorous measures will indeed result in the same success as for SARS depends on the extent of transmissibility of subclinical cases (asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic), including the timing of peak viral shedding during the course of disease, as well as on the role of fomites and other environmental contamination in propagating transmission.The answers to these questions will determine the success. Until those answers are known, the political and medical community needs to persist with containment efforts with the tools that are available at hand for the time being. China should be commended for its political will in implementing what might appear to be extreme measures. Undoubtedly, no other country could enact what China is currently doing. The daily decline in new cases by mid-February suggests that China is on the right path, showing that containment could be feasible. Other countries should be aware and reduce the spread of COVID-19. What is already known is that exportations to other countries need not result in rapid large-scale outbreaks, if the countries have the political will to rapidly implement early case detection, prompt isolation of ill people, comprehensive contact tracing, and immediate quarantine of all contacts. If this approach is not feasible because of widespread community transmission, then community quarantine is also needed with rigorous implementation of social distancing.Containment of COVID-19 should remain the focus at the moment. The short-term cost of containment will be far lower than the long-term cost of non-containment. However, closures of institutions and public places, and restrictions in travel and trade, cannot be maintained indefinitely. Countries have to face the reality that individual-case containment might not be possible in the long run, and there might be the need to move from containment to mitigation, balancing the costs and benefits of public health measures. Even if our public health measures are not able to fully contain the spread of COVID-19 because of the virus characteristics, they will still be effective in delaying the onset of widespread community transmission, reducing peak incidence and its impact on public services, and decreasing the overall attack rate. In addition, minimising the size of the outbreak or suppressing its peak can reduce global deaths by providing health systems with the opportunity to scale up and respond, and to slow down the global spread until effective vaccines become available.ContributorsAWS initiated this Personal View and wrote the first draft.

Most areas of the country have adopted public health first-level response measures (considered the highest level of response). In the face of the rapidly spreading disease and a large number of infected people, there is an urgent need for effective infection prevention and control measures. However, some of the measures that have been introduced have no scientific basis and have proven to be ineffective.First, although COVID-19 is spread by the airborne route, air disinfection of cities and communities is not known to be effective for disease control and needs to be stopped. The widespread practice of spraying disinfectant and alcohol in the sky, on roads, vehicles, and personnel has no value; moreover, large quantities of alcohol and disinfectant are potentially harmful to humans and should be avoided.3\n\n,  4\u2022 View related content for this articleSecond, in the use of personal protective equipment, we should try to distinguish different risk factors, adopt different epidemic prevention measures, and reduce the waste of personal protective equipment, as these resources are already in short supply. Although surgical masks are in widespread use by the general population, there is no evidence that these masks prevent the acquisition of COVID-19, although they might slightly reduce the spread from an infected patient. High-filtration masks such as N95 masks and protective clothing (goggles and gowns) should be used in hospitals where health-care workers are in direct contact with infected patients.5Third, the practice of blocking traffic and lockdown of villages is of no value for the prevention and control of COVID-19. Since the outbreak of COVID-19, some countries have suspended flights to and from China, and prevented Chinese people from travelling to their countries; both of these actions violate WHO International Health Regulations.6\nSimilarly, in community prevention and control of the disease, the measures taken by individual villages and communities to seal off roads are of no value.7\nSuch measures could result in civil unrest and reduce compliance with infection prevention and control advice.Fourth, public health education must be based on scientific evidence to reduce the anxiety and distress caused by misinformation. In particular, epidemiological findings need to be reported in a timely and objective manner so that they can be accurately assessed and interpreted. The risk of transmission with brief contact (less than 15 min face-to-face contact) or infection onset after 14 days of exposure to a known infected person (the estimated maximum incubation period) is low and should not be over-exaggerated. Misinformation spreads panic among the general population and is not conducive to implementation of epidemic control measures.8Fifth, WHO has made it clear that there are currently no known effective treatments for COVID-19 and does not recommend the use of antiviral drugs, antibiotics, glucocorticoids, or traditional Chinese medicine. Despite this, there have been reports of the use of oseltamivir, lopinavir/ritonavir, prednisone, antibiotics, and traditional Chinese medicine for the treatment of patients with COVID-19.9\nCare should be taken to not give patients drugs of unknown efficacy, which might be detrimental to critically ill patients with COVID-19; clinical trials are urgently required in this context.10\n\nLikewise, the development of a vaccine is an urgent public health priority.COVID-19 is an emerging infectious disease of global public health concern. Efforts to control the COVID-19 epidemic are likely to require an evidence-based, multifactorial approach. First, there is a need to limit human-to-human transmission, including reducing secondary infections among close contacts and health-care workers, preventing transmission amplification events, and preventing further international spread. Second, there is a need to rapidly identify, isolate, and provide optimised care for patients. Third, we need to identify and reduce transmission from the animal source or sources. Fourth, we need to address crucial uncertainties such as clinical severity, extent of transmission and infection, and treatment options, and accelerate the development of diagnostics, therapeutics, and vaccines. We also need to minimise social disruption and economic impact through international, collaborative and multisectoral approaches. Most importantly, we need to communicate the epidemiology and risks of COVID-19 clearly, both to health-care workers and to the general population, and to implement infection prevention and control measures that are based on sound scientific principles.We declare no competing interests.

He had thrombocytopenia (platelet count 140\u2008\u00d7\u2008109/mL) and a normal chest radiograph. He was discharged after a negative rapid test for dengue NS1, IgM, and IgG (SD Bioline Dengue Duo Kit; Abbott, South Korea). He returned to a public primary health-care clinic with persistent fever, worsening thrombocytopenia (89\u2008\u00d7\u2008109/mL), and new onset lymphopenia (0\u00b743\u2008\u00d7\u2008109/mL). A repeat dengue rapid test was positive for dengue IgM and IgG (Dengue Combo; Wells Bio, South Korea). He was referred to hospital for dengue with worsening cough and dyspnoea. A chest radiograph led to testing for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR (in-house laboratory-developed test detecting the N and ORF1ab genes) from a nasopharyngeal swab, which returned positive. The original seropositive sample and additional urine and blood samples tested negative for dengue, chikungunya, and Zika viruses by RT-PCR,3\n,  4\n,  5\nand a repeat dengue rapid test (SD Bioline) was also negative. Thus, the initial dengue seroconversion result was deemed a false positive.\u2022 View related content for this articleThe second case is a 57-year-old woman with no relevant past medical, travel, or contact history, who presented to a regional hospital on Feb 13, 2020, with fever, myalgia, a mild cough of 4 days, and 2 days of diarrhoea. She had thrombocytopenia (92\u2008\u00d7\u2008109/mL) and tested positive for dengue IgM (SD Bioline). She was discharged with outpatient follow up for dengue fever. She returned 2 days later with a persistent fever, worsening thrombocytopenia (65\u2008\u00d7\u2008109/mL), and new onset lymphopenia (0\u00b794\u2008\u00d7\u2008109/mL). Liver function tests were abnormal (aspartate aminotransferase 69 U/L [reference range 10\u201330 U/L], alanine aminotransferase 67 U/L [reference range <55 U/L], total bilirubin 35\u00b78 \u03bcmol/L [reference range 4\u00b77\u201323\u00b72 \u03bcmol/L]). Chest radiography was normal and she was admitted for dengue fever. She remained febrile despite normalisation of her blood counts and developed dyspnoea 3 days after admission. She was found to be positive for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR from a nasopharyngeal swab. A repeat dengue test (SD Bioline) was negative and an earlier blood sample also tested negative for dengue by RT-PCR.6\nThe initial dengue IgM result was deemed to be a false positive.Failing to consider COVID-19 because of a positive dengue rapid test result has serious implications not only for the patient but also for public health. Our cases highlight the importance of recognising false-positive dengue serology results (with different commercially available assays) in patients with COVID-19. We emphasise the urgent need for rapid, sensitive, and accessible diagnostic tests for SARS-CoV-2, which need to be highly accurate to protect public health.We declare no competing interests.", "S1473-30992030159-6": "Two Vietnamese adults returned to their home province of Vinh Phuc in northern Vietnam on Jan 17, 2020, from Wuhan, China, where they had been living since Nov 15, 2019, for a business trip. They presented with mild respiratory symptoms to their local health facilities at 4 days and 8 days, respectively, after arrival in Vinh Phuc. Both individuals were initially placed into respiratory isolation in hospital. Case 1 tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative organism of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), on Jan 30, 2020, and remained in isolation until recovery. Case 2 was discharged from isolation in hospital after having one negative test result on Jan 28 (11 days after returning from Wuhan). Following discharge, the patient attended a family social function. 2 days later, she was readmitted after a second nasal swab for SARS-CoV-2 taken during her time in hospital was reported as positive.Screening of 79 individuals who had been in contact with these two patients (namely, family members in the same household and anyone who had been within 2 m of them) was initiated on Jan 31. Six individuals from the same work team, who had also travelled from Wuhan on Jan 17, were isolated, and four of them tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 (cases 3, 4, and 8 in Vinh Phuc, and one case from another province). Five secondary cases were diagnosed within the social network of case 2. These included three household members (cases 6, 7, and 11) and two people who had attended the social function (cases 5 and 9; appendix p 1). Four of these individuals reported mild respiratory symptoms; the remaining patient was asymptomatic (case 7) at the time of diagnosis.\u2022 View related content for this articleOn Feb 8, 2020, increased contact investigation was commenced among an additional 343 contacts of the people returning from China and the secondary cases diagnosed in Vinh Phuc, with screening of contacts of any suspected cases, and health workers providing direct medical care. This ongoing investigation includes monitoring of body temperature and suspected symptoms daily. Those with symptoms have been quarantined at health facilities and tested for SARS-CoV-2. This additional cascade screening identified one further case, a boy aged 3 months (case 10) who had brief exposure to case 5 (his grandmother, aged 42 years) on Jan 28. He developed respiratory symptoms 9 days later (cough and rhinorrhoea) and tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 on Feb 11 (appendix pp 2). On Feb 13, when case 11, the father of case 2 and living in the same household, was identified, the resident commune (Son Loi) of case 2 was locked down. Residents were advised to stay in the commune, and body temperature and suspected symptoms in all residents were monitored daily by commune-based health workers reinforced by an external team. As of March 2, 18 days after case 11 was detected, no new cases have been identified.In summary, this outbreak investigation identified six cases of COVID-19 resulting from transmission in Vietnam. One case occurred after secondary spread from a person who had not visited China. This case illustrates the importance of isolating patients and suspected cases for at least 14 days after exposure and of community-wide screening to enhance diagnosis of COVID-19.This online publication has been corrected.

Pregnant women with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection who are asymptomatic should be self-monitored at home for clinical features of COVID-19 for at least 14 days.

Pregnant women with COVID-19 pneumonia should be managed by a multidisciplinary team at a tertiary care centre. When quick Sepsis-related Organ Failure Assessment criteria are met, the patient should be transferred to an intensive care unit.For pregnant women with confirmed infection, the choice of delivery timing should be individualised depending on the week of gestation and maternal, fetal, and delivery conditions. Whenever possible, vaginal delivery via induction of labour, with eventual instrumental delivery to avoid maternal exhaustion, should be favoured to avoid unnecessary surgical complications in an already sick patient. Septic shock, acute organ failure, or fetal distress should prompt emergency cesarean delivery (or termination if legal before fetal viability).Newborns of mothers positive for SARS-CoV-2 should be isolated for at least 14 days or until viral shedding clears, during which time direct breastfeeding is not recommended.These recommendations should be adapted to local health-care facilities, as well as in response to any further updates on SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19.We declare no competing interests.", "S1473-30992030132-8": "Both coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) are characterised by an overexuberant inflammatory response and, for SARS, viral load is not correlated with the worsening of symptoms.1\n,  2\nIn our previous Correspondence to The Lancet,3\nwe described how BenevolentAI's proprietary artificial intelligence (AI)-derived knowledge graph,4\nqueried by a suite of algorithms, enabled identification of a target and a potential therapeutic against SARS coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2; the causative organism in COVID-19). We identified a group of approved drugs that could inhibit clathrin-mediated endocytosis and thereby inhibit viral infection of cells (appendix). The drug targets are members of the numb-associated kinase (NAK) family\u2014including AAK1 and GAK\u2014the inhibition of which has been shown to reduce viral infection in vitro.5\n,  6\nBaricitinib was identified as a NAK inhibitor, with a particularly high affinity for AAK1, a pivotal regulator of clathrin-mediated endocytosis. We suggested that this drug could be of use in countering SARS-CoV-2 infections, subject to appropriate clinical testing.To take this work further in a short timescale, a necessity when dealing with a new human pathogen, we re-examined the affinity and selectivity of all the approved drugs in our knowledge graph to identify those with both antiviral and anti-inflammatory properties. Such drugs are predicted to be of particular importance in the treatment of severe cases of COVID-19, when the host inflammatory response becomes a major cause of lung damage and subsequent mortality. Comparison of the properties of the three best candidates are shown in the table. Baricitinib, fedratinib, and ruxolitinib are potent and selective JAK inhibitors approved for indications such as rheumatoid arthritis and myelofibrosis. All three are powerful anti-inflammatories that, as JAK\u2013STAT signalling inhibitors, are likely to be effective against the consequences of the elevated levels of cytokines (including interferon-\u03b3) typically observed in people with COVID-19\u00b72\nAlthough the three candidates have similar JAK inhibitor potencies, a high affinity for AAK1 suggests baricitinib is the best of the group, especially given its once-daily oral dosing and acceptable side-effect profile.7\n\nThe most significant side-effect seen over 4214 patient-years in the clinical trial programmes used for European Medicines Agency registration was a small increase in upper respiratory tract infections (similar to that observed with methotrexate), but the incidence of serious infections (eg, herpes zoster) over 52 weeks' dosing was small (3\u00b72 per 100 patient-years), and similar to placebo.7\n\nUse of this agent in patients with COVID-19 over 7\u201314 days, for example, suggests side-effects would be trivial.\nTableProperties of three antiviral and anti-inflammatory candidate drugs\nBaricitinib Ruxolitinib Fedratinib\nDaily dose, mg 2\u201310 25 400\nAffinity and efficacy: Kd or IC50, nM*\nAAK1\u2020\nCell free 17 100 32\nCell 34 700 960\nGAK\u2020\nCell free 136 120 1\nCell 272 840 30\nBIKE\u2020\nCell free 40 210 32\nCell 80 1470 960\nJAK1\nCell free 6 3 20\nCell 12 20 600\nJAK2\nCell free 6 3 3\nCell 11 21 100\nJAK3\nCell free >400 2 79\nCell >800 14 2370\nTYK2\nCell free 53 1 20\nCell 106 7 600\nPharmacokinetics\nPlasma protein binding 50% 97% 95%\nCmax (unbound), nM 103\u2021\n117 170\nSafety: tolerated dose \u226410 mg/day \u226420 mg twice daily \u2264400 mg/day\nSee regulatory approval documents for further information on these drugs.

By contrast, at therapeutic doses used for the treatment of patients with rheumatoid arthritis, the free plasma concentrations of baricitinib are predicted to be sufficient to inhibit AAK1, and potentially GAK, in cell-based assays.The predicted inhibition of clathrin-mediated endocytosis by baricitinib is unlikely to be observed with other anti-arthritic drugs or JAK inhibitors. Our analysis of the closely related JAK inhibitors ruxolitinib and fedratinib (table) illustrates that the predicted unbound plasma exposure required to inhibit the enzymes needed for clathrin-mediated endocytosis greatly exceeds the currently tolerated exposures used therapeutically. These drugs are, therefore, unlikely to reduce viral infectivity at tolerated doses, although they might reduce the host inflammatory response through JAK inhibition. Intriguingly, another JAK inhibitor, tofacitinib, shows no detectable inhibition of AAK1. The high affinity of baricitinib for NAKs, its anti-inflammatory properties, and its ability to ameliorate associated chronic inflammation in interferonopathies,8\ntogether with its advantageous pharmacokinetic properties, appear to make it a special case among the approved drugs.In addition, the potential for combination therapy with baracitinib is high because of its low plasma protein binding and minimal interaction with CYP enzymes and drug transporters. Furthermore, there is the potential for combining baricitinib with the direct-acting antivirals (lopinavir or ritonavir and remdesivir) currently being used in the COVID-19 outbreak, since it has a minimal interaction with the relevant CYP drug-metabolising enzymes. Combinations of baricitinib with these direct-acting antivirals could reduce viral infectivity, viral replication, and the aberrant host inflammatory response.

The pneumonia induced by the SARS-CoV-2 is named coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). By Feb 22, 2020, this virus has affected more than 77\u2008700 people worldwide and caused more than 2300 deaths. To date, no specific treatment has been proven to be effective for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Apart from supportive care, such as oxygen supply in mild cases and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation for the critically ill patients, specific drugs for this disease are still being researched. In the USA, the first patient infected with SARS-CoV-2 was treated by supportive care and intravenous remdesivir, before the patient recovered and was discharged.1\nHowever, randomised clinical trials are needed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of remdesivir in the treatment of COVID-19.Convalescent plasma or immunoglobulins have been used as a last resort to improve the survival rate of patients with SARS whose condition continued to deteriorate despite treatment with pulsed methylprednisolone. Moreover, several studies showed a shorter hospital stay and lower mortality in patients treated with convalescent plasma than those who were not treated with convalescent plasma.2\n,  3\n,  4\nIn 2014, the use of convalescent plasma collected from patients who had recovered from Ebola virus disease was recommended by WHO as an empirical treatment during outbreaks.5\n\nA protocol for the use of convalescent plasma in the treatment of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus was established in 2015.6\nIn terms of patients with pandemic 2009 influenza A H1N1 (H1N1pdm09) virus infection, a prospective cohort study by Hung and colleagues showed a significant reduction in the relative risk of mortality (odds ratio 0\u00b720 [95% CI 0\u00b706\u20130\u00b769], p=0\u00b701) for patients treated with convalescent plasma.7\nAdditionally, in a subgroup analysis, viral load after convalescent plasma treatment was significantly lower on days 3, 5, and 7 after intensive care unit admission. No adverse events were observed. A multicentre, prospective, double-blind, randomised controlled trial by Hung and colleagues showed that using convalescent plasma from patients who recovered from the influenza A H1N1pdm09 virus infection to treat patients with severe influenza A H1N1 infection was associated with a lower viral load and reduced mortality within 5 days of symptom onset.8\nA meta-analysis by Mair-Jenkins and colleagues showed that the mortality was reduced after receiving various doses of convalescent plasma in patients with severe acute respiratory infections, with no adverse events or complications after treatment.9\nAnother meta-analysis by Luke and colleagues identified eight studies involving 1703 patients with 1918 influenzapneumonia from 1918 to 1925 who received an infusion of influenza-convalescent human blood products, which showed a pooled absolute reduction of 21% (95% CI 15\u201327; p<0\u00b7001) in the overall crude case-fatality rate at low risk of bias.10\u2022 View related content for this articleOne possible explanation for the efficacy of convalescent plasma therapy is that the antibodies from convalescent plasma might suppress viraemia. Schoofs and colleagues reported that 3BNC117-mediated immunotherapy, which is a broad neutralising antibody to HIV-1, enhances host humoral immunity to HIV-1.11\nAn in vivo trial also showed that the effects of this antibody were not only limited to free viral clearance and blocking new infection, but also included acceleration of infected cell clearance.12\nViraemia peaks in the first week of infection in most viral illnesses. The patient usually develops a primary immune response by days 10\u201314, which is followed by virus clearance.4\nTherefore, theoretically, it should be more effective to administer the convalescent plasma at the early stage of disease.4\nHowever, other treatments might have an effect on the relationship between convalescent plasma and antibody level, including antiviral drugs, steroids, and intravenous immunoglobulin.10According to WHO,13\n\nmanagement of COVID-19 has mainly focused on infection prevention, case detection and monitoring, and supportive care. However, no specific anti-SARS-CoV-2 treatment is recommended because of the absence of evidence. Most importantly, the current guidelines emphasise that systematic corticosteroids should not be given routinely for the treatment of COVID-19, which was also the recommendation in a a Commnt in The Lancet.14\n\nEvidence shows that convalescent plasma from patients who have recovered from viral infections can be used as a treatment without the occurrence of severe adverse events. Therefore, it might be worthwhile to test the safety and efficacy of convalescent plasma transfusion in SARS-CoV-2-infected patients.This work is supported by grants from the Clinical Medical Study Program of Children's Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, China ( YBXM-2019-013 ).

The number of cases has been increasing rapidly: by Feb 15, 2020, more than 60\u2008000 cases of COVID-19 pneumonia had been reported in China and in other countries worldwide (including Thailand, Japan, South Korea, and the USA),6\n\n,  7\n\n,  8\n\n,  9\n\nand 1524 patients had died, equivalent to a mortality rate of around 2%.The clinical features of the initial 41 patients confirmed to be infected with SARS-CoV-2 included lower respiratory tract illness with fever, dry cough, and dyspnoea,5\na manifestation similar to those of two other diseases caused by coronaviruses, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS).10\n,  11\nHowever, the radiological changes in the lungs of people with COVID-19 pneumonia have not been fully characterised. CT is important in the diagnosis and treatment of lung diseases. In our experience, the imaging features of COVID-19 pneumonia are diverse, ranging from normal appearance to diffuse changes in the lungs. In addition, different radiological patterns are observed at different times throughout the disease course. Because the time between onset of symptoms and the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) was as short as 9 days among the initial patients with COVID-19 pneumonia,5\nearly recognition of the disease is essential for the management of these patients.Research in context\nEvidence before this study\nBefore this study, we searched PubMed, Medline, and Google Scholar on Jan, 24, 2020, for articles describing the radiological features of patients infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2; previously known as 2019 novel coronavirus [2019-nCoV]), using the search terms \u201cnovel coronavirus\u201d or \u201c2019-nCoV\u201d and \u201cradiology \u201cor \u201cimaging\u201d or \u201cCT\u201d, with no time restrictions. We also searched CNKI and Wanfang Data using the same terms in Chinese, with no time restrictions. We found only previously published research discussing the radiological characteristics of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus or Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, and preliminary studies on the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 in Wuhan. We found no published work about the radiological characteristics of patients with pneumonia caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection.\nAdded value of this study\nWe analysed chest CT images from 81 patients confirmed to have COVID-19 pneumonia caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection, and described the imaging findings across different follow-up periods of the disease, including subclinical and clinical stages up to 3 weeks after symptom onset. This study is, to the best of our knowledge, the largest case series to date on the CT findings of COVID-19 pneumonia worldwide, and provides detailed information on the radiological, clinical, and laboratory features of these patients. Our findings provide insight in the evolution of the disease and its corresponding imaging changes, and suggest potential associations between imaging findings and patient outcomes, which requires further study.\nImplications of all the available evidence\nSARS-CoV-2 has substantial capacity to infect humans, and is capable of human-to-human transmission. Infection can lead to severe respiratory symptoms, including acute respiratory distress syndrome, and the mortality rate is around 2%. Combining imaging assessments with clinical and laboratory findings could help to identify SARS-CoV-2 infections early.Evidence before this studyBefore this study, we searched PubMed, Medline, and Google Scholar on Jan, 24, 2020, for articles describing the radiological features of patients infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2; previously known as 2019 novel coronavirus [2019-nCoV]), using the search terms \u201cnovel coronavirus\u201d or \u201c2019-nCoV\u201d and \u201cradiology \u201cor \u201cimaging\u201d or \u201cCT\u201d, with no time restrictions.

Infection can lead to severe respiratory symptoms, including acute respiratory distress syndrome, and the mortality rate is around 2%. Combining imaging assessments with clinical and laboratory findings could help to identify SARS-CoV-2 infections early.We aimed to analyse the evolution of chest CT imaging features in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, and to compare the imaging findings across the disease course, to facilitate early diagnosis of this newly emerging, life-threatening infection.This was a retrospective study done at two centres in Wuhan. Patients with confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia who were admitted to Wuhan Jinyintan hospital or Union Hospital of Tongji Medical College, and who underwent serial chest CT scans, were retrospectively enrolled.In the patients who presented to Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital, SARS-CoV-2 infection was confirmed by next-generation sequencing or real-time RT-PCR, in according with a previously published protocol.5\nThe following primers and probe targeted to the envelope gene of SARS-CoV-2 were used: forward primer 5\u02b9-TCAGAATGCCAATCTCCCCAAC-3\u02b9; reverse primer 5\u02b9-AAAGGTCCACCCGATACATTGA-3\u02b9; probe 5\u02b9CY5-CTAGTTACACTAGCCATCCTTACTGC-3\u02b9BHQ1.The diagnosis of the cases from Union Hospital was initially based on the criteria published by WHO on Jan 12, 2020,12\n\nand all cases were later confirmed by real-time RT-PCR analysis of throat swab specimens, using the same protocol as above when PCR kits were available.Based on the time interval between onset of symptoms and the CT scan, we designated four groups of patients in our study: group 1 (subclinical cases, in which CT scans were done before onset of symptoms); group 2 (CT scans done \u22641 week after symptom onset); group 3 (CT scans done >1 to 2 weeks after symptom onset); and group 4 (CT scans done >2 weeks to 3 weeks after symptom onset). Three readers (XH, NJ, and YF) recorded the clinical characteristics, laboratory findings, and comorbidities of the patients at the time of imaging.This study was approved by the institutional review boards of the relevant centres. The requirement for informed patient consent was waived by the ethics committee for this retrospective study.All CT scans were obtained with patients in the supine position, using one of the following scanners: SOMATOM Perspective, SOMATOM Spirit, or SOMATOM Definition AS+ (Siemens Healthineers, Forchheim, Germany). Scans were done from the level of the upper thoracic inlet to the inferior level of the costophrenic angle, and the following parameters were used: detector collimation widths 64 \u00d7\u20080\u00b76 mm, 128\u2008\u00d7\u20080\u00b76 mm, 64\u2008\u00d7\u20080\u00b76 mm, and 64\u2008\u00d7\u20080\u00b76 mm; and tube voltage 120 kV. The tube current was regulated by an automatic exposure control system (CARE Dose 4D; Siemens Healthineers). Images were reconstructed with a slice thickness of 1\u00b75 mm or 1 mm and an interval of 1\u00b75 mm or 1 mm, respectively. The reconstructed images were transmitted to the workstation and picture archiving and communication systems (PACS) for multiplanar reconstruction post-processing.Images from cases seen at Union Hospital were analysed by two radiologists (HS [a senior thoracic radiologist with 30 years' experience] and XH [a radiology resident with 4 years' experience in interpreting chest CT images]). Images from cases seen at Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital were interpreted by two radiologists experienced in thoracic radiology (YF [12 years' experience] and NJ [10 years' experience]). All Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) images from the CT studies were analysed without access to clinical or laboratory findings. The evaluators independently and freely assessed the CT features using both axial CT images and multiplanar reconstruction images. After separate evaluations, any disagreements were resolved by discussion and consensus. CT imaging features recorded from our cohort are summarised in the appendix 2 (p 4).Follow-up chest CT scans were reviewed by two radiologists (HS and YF). The images were assessed and the evolution of lesions rated as either no significant change, resolution, or progression, compared with the previous chest CT from the same patient (appendix 2 p 4). Decisions were reached by consensus.Analyses were done with SAS software version 9.4. Distribution normality was assessed using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. Normally distributed data were presented as mean (SD), non-normally distributed data as median (IQR), and categorical variables as frequency (%). CIs of proportions were calculated using the Clopper-Pearson method. Differences between groups were analysed by Fisher's exact test (for categorical data) or one-way ANOVA (for continuous data).There was no funding source for this study.81 patients who were admitted to Wuhan Jinyintan hospital (n=49) or Union Hospital of Tongji Medical College (n=32) between Dec 20, 2019, and Jan 23, 2020, and who had confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia were retrospectively enrolled in our study. Epidemiologically, there were four main clusters of patients: 31 (38%) patients had direct exposure to Huanan seafood market, 15 (19%) were health-care workers who had close contact with patients at the hospital who had confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia, seven (9%) were familial clusters, and the remaining 28 (35%) did not have any obvious history of exposure. Patients were assigned to groups on the basis of time between symptom onset and first CT scan: 15 (19%) patients (including health-care workers who had had close contact with patients with confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia) were assigned to group 1, 21 (26%) to group 2, 30 (37%) to group 3, and 15 (19%) to group 4.The clinical characteristics and laboratory results of patients by group are summarised in the table (see appendix 2 [pp 1\u20133] for additional data). In the full cohort, the mean age was 49\u00b75 years (SD 11; range 25\u201381), and there was no gender difference (42 [52%] men and 39 [48%] women). No significant differences in age (p=0\u00b72778) or sex distribution (p=0\u00b70871) between groups were identified. The most common symptoms at onset were fever (59 [73%] patients) and dry cough (48 [59%]). Other non-specific symptoms included dizziness (two [2%] patients), diarrhoea (three [4%]), vomiting (four [5%]), headache (five [6%]), and generalised weakness (seven [9%]). Among groups 2\u20134 (symptomatic patients), no significant differences in clinical parameters were found. Patients in group 1 had significantly lower mean concentrations of C-reactive protein (6\u00b79 mg/L, p=0\u00b70051) and aspartate aminotransferase (30\u00b72 U/L, p=0\u00b70026) than patients in the other three groups. Other laboratory findings did not significantly differ among groups, and the prevalence of underlying diseases was similar in all groups.\nTableClinical characteristics and laboratory findings of

Interlobular septal thickening, thickening of the adjacent pleura, nodules, round cystic changes, bronchiolectasis, pleural effusion, and lymphadenopathy were rarely observed in this group. In group 2 (first week after symptom onset), lesions quickly evolved to become bilateral (19 [90%] patients) and diffuse (11 [52%]), but remained predominantly of ground-glass opacity appearance (17 [81%]). Pleural effusion (one [5%]) and lymphadenopathy (three [14%]) were detected at this stage. In group 3 (second week after symptom onset), as the disease progressed, the ground-glass opacity pattern was still the predominant CT finding (17 [57%]); however, consolidation patterns (nine [30%]) were also noted. In group 4 (third week after symptom onset), ground-glass opacities (five [33%]) and reticular patterns (five [33%]) were the predominant imaging pattern (figure 3). Bronchiolectasis (two [13%]), thickening of the adjacent pleura (seven [47%]), pleural effusions (two [13%]), and lymphadenopathy (two [13%]) could also be seen at this stage (appendix 2 pp 5\u20136).\nFigure 3Distribution of various patterns of lung changes on CT scans at various timepoints from symptom onset\nShow full caption\nView Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)By Feb 8, 2020, 62 (77%) patients had been discharged, with a mean interval between symptom onset and discharge of 23\u00b72 days (SD 6; range 12\u201341). 16 (20%) patients were still in hospital, and three (4%) patients had died (on days 12, 14, and 30, after hospital admission due to ARDS). Patient 1, who died on day 12 after admission, was a 60-year-old man with chronic pulmonary disease (tuberculosis). The CT scan obtained from this patient on day 8 after symptom onset showed extensive ground-glass opacities in both lungs, giving a white lung appearance (figure 4). The second patient who died (patient 2) was 73-year-old man who had had type 2 diabetes for several years, and showed progressive radiographic deterioration on CT scans taken on days 3, 7, and 11 after symptom onset. Patient 3, who died on day 30 after admission, was a 77-year-old man with hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and cerebrovascular disease. A CT scan showed mild pneumonia on day 5 after symptom onset in this patient (figure 5A), and two follow-up CT scans 10 days and 15 days later revealed rapid progression of the lung lesions with bilateral pleural effusions (figure 5B, C).\nFigure 4Transverse CT scans from a 60-year-old man (day 8 after symptom onset)\nShow full caption\nView Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)\nFigure 5Transverse thin-section serial CT scans from a 77-year-old man\nShow full caption\nView Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Follow-up CT images were obtained from 57 (70%) patients (36 from Wuhan Jinyintan hospital, and 21 from Union Hospital). 23 of these patients had two CT scans, 19 had three scans, and 15 had four scans available. Four patterns of evolution throughout the series of CT scans were observed among these 57 patients: initial progression to peak level, followed by radiographic improvement (type 1), seen in 26 (46%) patients (figure 6), of whom 24 (92%) patients were discharged from hospital (median stay 25 days [IQR 20\u201327]); radiographic deterioration (type 2), seen in 18 (32%) patients (figure 5), of whom two (11%) died (patients 2 and 3); radiographic improvement (type 3), seen in eight (14%) patients, of whom five (63%) were discharged from hospital (median stay 19 days [IQR 11\u201325]); and unchanged radiographic appearance (type 4), seen in five (9%) patients, all of whom were still in hospital at the cutoff date (Feb 8).\nFigure 6Transverse thin-section serial CT scans from a 42-year-old woman\nShow full caption\nView Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The Coronaviridae family of viruses includes six previously known human-infecting coronaviruses, which are enveloped, non-segmented, positive-sense RNA viruses that are broadly distributed in humans and other mammals.13\nAlthough four of these coronaviruses cause only mild respiratory symptoms similar to the common cold, epidemics caused by two betacoronaviruses, SARS-CoV in 200214\n,  15\nand MERS-CoV in 2012, involved more than 8000 patients and 1000 patients, respectively,16\n,  17\nwith high mortality rates (10% for SARS-CoV and 37% for MERS-CoV). The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 is the seventh member of the Coronaviridae family known to infect humans. The mortality rate of COVID-19 so far is lower than that of SARS or MERS coronavirus diseases; however, SARS-CoV-2 is highly infectious and could be a significant health threat.In our study, the predisposing conditions for COVID-19 pneumonia tended to be old age and medical comorbidities (such as chronic pulmonary disease, diabetes, and other chronic diseases), similar to previous viral infections such as influenza H7N9.18\n,  19\nThere was no obvious predilection for males or females in our cohort. However, another study reported that 30 (73%) of 41 infected patients were men.5\nThis discrepancy might be due to the differences in demographic features and small cohorts. By Feb 8, 2020, three patients in our study had died, representing a mortality rate of around 4%. All deaths occurred in men older than 60 years who had underlying diseases, consistent with previous reports.5\nThus, old age, male sex, and presence of comorbidities might be risk factors for poor prognosis.Fever, cough, and dyspnoea were the most common symptoms in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, consistent with the manifestation of lower respiratory tract infections. By contrast, upper respiratory tract symptoms were less common in these patients, indicating that the cells targeted by the virus might be located in the lower airway.5\nOther non-specific symptoms included dizziness, diarrhoea, vomiting, headache, and generalised weakness, which occurred in around 2\u20139% of patients. Notably, 15 cases of asymptomatic infection were discovered on the basis of abnormal lung findings on CT scans, suggesting that chest CT scans or serum antibody tests should be done in asymptomatic high-risk individuals with a history of exposure to patients with COVID-19 pneumonia to facilitate early identification of the disease.In our cohort, leukocytosis was detected in 26 (32%) patients and lymphocytosis in 54 (67%) patients. Concentrations of C-reactive protein and serum amyloid A protein were elevated in most patients, as observed in previous betacoronavirus infections.10\n,  11\n,  20\nIn the subgroup of asymptomatic patients (group 1), concentrations of C-reactive protein (6\u00b79 mg/L) and aspartate aminotransferase (30\u00b72 U/L) were lower than those in symptomatic patients.The mean number of involved lung segments in our cohort was 10\u00b75, with the right lower lobes most commonly affected. This finding is similar to those of a previous radiological study of patients with H7N9 influenza infection.21\nThis finding might be due to the anatomical structure of the trachea and bronchi: as the right bronchus is short and straight, the causative virus might tend to favour this location.The extent of disease on CT scans showed a marked increase from the subclinical period through the first and second weeks after symptom onset, then decreased gradually in the third week. A previous study showed that the median time from onset of symptoms to mechanical ventilation was 10\u00b75 days (IQR 7\u00b70\u201314\u00b70) and to intensive care unit admission was 10\u00b75 days (8\u00b70\u201317\u00b70).5\nThus, our findings indicate that the radiological evolution of COVID-19 pneumonia is consistent with the clinical course of the disease.Most patients in our cohort showed bilateral lung involvement, with lesions mainly located peripherally and subpleurally with diffuse distribution. The predominant pattern was ground-glass opacity, with ill-defined margins, air bronchograms, smooth or irregular interlobular or septal thickening, and thickening of the adjacent pleura. These imaging characteristics are non-specific and bear some resemblance to those of SARS-CoV22\n,  23\n,  24\nand MERS-CoV infections.25\n,  26\nHowever, unlike SARS-CoV infections, some patients in our study presented with pleural effusion, lymphadenopathy, and round cystic changes on CT. Previous studies showed that the presence of pleural effusion in patients infected with MERS-CoV or avian influenza H5N1 was a poor prognostic indicator.25\n,  27\n,  28\nSimilarly, in one patient who died in our study (patient 3), a follow-up CT scans showed that he had developed bilateral pleural effusion. On the other hand, lymphadenopathy has also been seen in cases of H5N1 infection,28\nwhich can present as a rapidly progressive pneumonia that results in ARDS. Round cystic changes on CT might be associated with the process of resorption of consolidation; which might be explained by the infection causing damage to the alveolar walls and leading to pneumatoceles. Other findings included intralobular or interlobular septal thickening, and a crazy-paving pattern. However, none of the CT features of COVID-19 seem to be specific or diagnostic, and COVID-19 pneumonia shares CT features with other non-infectious conditions that present as subpleural air-space disease. For example, patients with bronchiolitis obliterans with organising pneumonia29\n,  30\noften show nodules (32%),29\nlymphadenopathy (13%),30\nand pleural effusion (20%).30\nThese findings were present, albeit with lower frequency, among our patients with COVID-19 pneumonia (nodules 6%, lymphadenopathy 13%, pleural effusion 5%). However, tree-in-bud signs, masses, cavitations, and calcifications, often suggestive of bacterial or chronic infections, were absent in our study.The typical pattern of CT images in subclinical patients (group 1) was unilateral, multifocal, predominantly ground-glass opacities. In the first week after symptom onset (group 2), lesions quickly evolved to bilateral, diffuse disease, with a relative decrease in the frequency of ground-glass opacities and a transition to consolidation and mixed-pattern development. Pleural effusion and lymphadenopathy were also detected in group 2. Subsequently, ground-glass opacities continued to decrease in frequency throughout the second week after symptom onset (group 3), while consolidation became the second most common pattern. A reticular pattern associated with bronchiolectasis and irregular interlobular or septal thickening were also noted to increase progressively from the second week. These findings indicated the appearance of interstitial changes, suggesting the development of fibrosis. However, since the natural history of COVID-19 pneumonia is yet to be fully explored, it is too early to label these lung changes as irreversible fibrosis. As the disease progressed in the third week after symptom onset, consolidation and mixed patterns became more common, while ground-glass opacities decreased further. Bronchiolectasis, thickening of the adjacent pleura, and pleural effusion mainly appeared at this stage.Serial CT imaging of patients could help to continuously monitor disease changes. Follow-up CT showed progression or improvement of lung lesions during treatment, sensitively reflecting therapeutic effects, and these changes might be related to outcomes in such patients. The most common pattern of evolution throughout series of CT scans in this study was initial progression to a peak level, followed by radiographic improvement (type 1), and most of these patients were subsequently discharged. In addition, most patients who showed a pattern of radiographic improvement across several scans (type 3) were discharged from hospital. Thus, a type 1 or type 3 disease course might be associated with favourable outcomes. On the other hand, progressive radiographic deterioration despite medical treatment seems to be associated with poor prognosis, with two deaths in our study\u2008occurring among the 18 patients with the type 2 pattern.Our study had several limitations. First, at the time of data collection, nucleic acid testing for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection had not yet been introduced at Union Hospital, and 33 patients were therefore diagnosed clinically on the basis of WHO criteria.12\n\nHowever, all these cases were confirmed by nucleic acid testing when kits became available later. Second, we compared imaging patterns between four groups of different time intervals from the onset of symptoms, which does not account for potential individual variations. Third, because of the short time for case collection, follow-up CT scans were available for only 57 patients, around 40% of whom had only two CT scans. Although we have outlined the main patterns of evolution seen on CT imaging in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, long-term radiological follow-up is needed to confirm our findings. Finally, as lung biopsy specimens were not available in this study, the relationship between radiological and histopathological findings remains to be investigated. Therefore, other potential causes of ground-glass opacity, such as pulmonary oedema and haemorrhage, cannot be estimated.In conclusion, COVID-19 pneumonia tends to manifest on lung CT scans as bilateral, subpleural, ground-glass opacities with air bronchograms, ill-defined margins, and a slight predominance in the right lower lobe. Abnormal lung CT findings can be present even in asymptomatic patients, and lesions can rapidly evolve into a diffuse ground-glass opacity predominance or consolidation pattern within 1\u20133 weeks after onset of symptoms, peaking at around 2 weeks after onset. Old age, male sex, underlying comorbidities and progressive radiographic deterioration on follow-up CT might be risk factors for poor prognosis in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia.ContributorsHS, YF, and CZ conceived and designed the study.

In The Lancet Infectious Diseases, Heshui Shi and colleagues3\ndiscuss the CT findings and temporal changes of COVID-19 pneumonia with reference to the time of onset of symptoms, in the largest cohort thus far reported. The predominant CT findings included ground-glass opacification, consolidation, bilateral involvement, and peripheral and diffuse distribution. These findings concur with other reports in smaller cohorts and with our own experience.4\n,  5\n,  6\nNotably, in Shi and colleagues' study, the asymptomatic (subclinical) group of patients showed early CT changes, supporting what was first observed in a familial cluster with COVID-19 pneumonia.7\nConversely, other studies have shown positive RT-PCR results for SARS-CoV-2 in the absence of CT changes, or abnormal CT findings with initial false-negative RT-PCR results.8\nAs the epidemic evolves, we are starting to observe the varied presentations of COVID-19 pneumonia, with symptomatic patients showing concordant CT and RT-PCR findings.8\nNevertheless, this small number of individuals with COVID-19 pneumonia poses a diagnostic dilemma given the varied manifestations.\u2022 View related content for this articleThe evolution of the disease on CT is not well understood. Shi and colleagues reported the presence of unilateral ground-glass opacities in a subgroup of 15 asymptomatic patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, substantiating previous anecdotal reports that asymptomatic patients could have CT changes before symptom onset. This finding suggests that CT is a sensitive modality with which to detect COVID-19 pneumonia, even in asymptomatic individuals, and could be considered as a screening tool\u2014together with RT-PCR\u2014when a patient has significant travel history or has had close contact with an infected individual. Furthermore, CT might be a particularly important screening tool in the small proportion of patients who have false-negative RT-PCR results. Shi and colleagues also showed that the lesions that were present in asymptomatic individuals progressed to bilateral diffuse disease with consolidation at around the first to second week after symptom onset.9In Hubei, there was a surge of diagnoses of COVID-19 on Feb 12 because of the introduction of new diagnostic criteria that included CT changes. These criteria were employed to ensure timely treatment and isolation measures, because of the delays associated with laboratory testing and a large number of patients presenting with respiratory symptoms in the province.As the predominant pattern seen in COVID-19 pneumonia is ground-glass opacification, detecting COVID-19 with use of chest radiography\u2014on which this type of abnormality is often imperceivable, particularly in patients with few symptoms or low severity\u2014is likely to be challenging. By contrast, chest radiographs were used frequently in the diagnosis of SARS as both ground-glass opacification and consolidation were present early.10\n,  11The current literature is partly skewed by the geographical distribution of COVID-19 pneumonia and the preferential use of CT over chest radiograph in China. This preference might be due to the ease of access to CT in China and the lack of requirement for intravenous contrast agent for the examination. Therefore, it is unclear whether the threshold for performing CT evaluation of potential lung changes should be lower when chest radiographs are normal. Further research is needed to better select patients for CT examination, to define the utility of CT in COVID-19 pneumonia, and to explore the application of artificial intelligence in screening chest radiographs in suspected cases.Overall, we congratulate Shi and colleagues in adding valuable information to the current literature. The authors carefully evaluated the CT findings in a large cohort of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, providing indirect evidence of the evolution of the CT changes with reference to the onset of symptoms. There is more to be learnt about this novel contagious viral pneumonia; more research is needed into the correlation of CT findings with clinical severity and progression, the predictive value of baseline CT or temporal changes for disease outcome, and the sequelae of acute lung injury induced by COVID-19.View Large Image\nCopyright \u00a9 2020 ElsevierWe declare no competing interests.", "S1473-30992030119-5": "Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is spreading rapidly across China, and as of Feb 16, 2020, had been reported in 26 countries globally. The availability of accurate and robust epidemiological, clinical, and laboratory data early in an epidemic is important to guide public health decision-making.1\nConsistent recording of epidemiological information is important to understand transmissibility, risk of geographic spread, routes of transmission, and risk factors for infection, and to provide the baseline for epidemiological modelling that can inform planning of response and containment efforts to reduce the burden of disease. Furthermore, detailed information provided in real time is crucial for deciding where to prioritise surveillance.Line list data are rarely available openly in real time during outbreaks. However, they enable a multiplicity of analyses to be undertaken by different groups, using various models and assumptions, which can help build consensus on robust inference. Parallels exist between this and the open sharing of genomic data.2\u2022 View related content for this articleWe have built a centralised repository of individual-level information on patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 (in China, confirmed by detection of virus nucleic acid at the City and Provincial Centers for Disease Control and Prevention), including their travel history, location (highest resolution available and corresponding latitude and longitude), symptoms, and reported onset dates, as well as confirmation dates and basic demographics. Information is collated from a variety of sources, including official reports from WHO, Ministries of Health, and Chinese local, provincial, and national health authorities. If additional data are available from reliable online reports, they are included. Data are available openly and are updated on a regular basis (around twice a day).We hope these data continue to be used to build evidence for planning, modelling, and epidemiological studies to better inform the public, policy makers, and international organisations and funders as to where and how to improve surveillance, response efforts, and delivery of resources, which are crucial factors in containing the COVID-19 epidemic.The epidemic is unfolding rapidly and reports are outdated quickly, so it will be necessary to build computational infrastructure that can handle the large expected increase in case reports. Data sharing will be vital to evaluate and maintain accurate reporting of cases during this outbreak.3We declare no competing interests. This work was funded by the Oxford Martin School. A full list of Open COVID-19 Data Curation Group members is provided in the appendix.", "S1473-30992030120-1": "In December, 2019, a local outbreak of pneumonia of initially unknown cause was detected in Wuhan (Hubei, China), and was quickly determined to be caused by a novel coronavirus,1\n\nnamely severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The outbreak has since spread to every province of mainland China as well as 27 other countries and regions, with more than 70\u2008000 confirmed cases as of Feb 17, 2020.2\n\nIn response to this ongoing public health emergency, we developed an online interactive dashboard, hosted by the Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) at Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD, USA, to visualise and track reported cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in real time. The dashboard, first shared publicly on Jan 22, illustrates the location and number of confirmed COVID-19 cases, deaths, and recoveries for all affected countries. It was developed to provide researchers, public health authorities, and the general public with a user-friendly tool to track the outbreak as it unfolds. All data collected and displayed are made freely available, initially through Google Sheets and now through a GitHub repository, along with the feature layers of the dashboard, which are now included in the Esri Living Atlas.The dashboard reports cases at the province level in China; at the city level in the USA, Australia, and Canada; and at the country level otherwise. During Jan 22\u201331, all data collection and processing were done manually, and updates were typically done twice a day, morning and night (US Eastern Time). As the outbreak evolved, the manual reporting process became unsustainable; therefore, on Feb 1, we adopted a semi-automated living data stream strategy. Our primary data source is DXY, an online platform run by members of the Chinese medical community, which aggregates local media and government reports to provide cumulative totals of COVID-19 cases in near real time at the province level in China and at the country level otherwise. Every 15 min, the cumulative case counts are updated from DXY for all provinces in China and for other affected countries and regions. For countries and regions outside mainland China (including Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan), we found DXY cumulative case counts to frequently lag behind other sources; we therefore manually update these case numbers throughout the day when new cases are identified. To identify new cases, we monitor various Twitter feeds, online news services, and direct communication sent through the dashboard. Before manually updating the dashboard, we confirm the case numbers with regional and local health departments, including the respective centres for disease control and prevention (CDC) of China, Taiwan, and Europe, the Hong Kong Department of Health, the Macau Government, and WHO, as well as city-level and state-level health authorities. For city-level case reports in the USA, Australia, and Canada, which we began reporting on Feb 1, we rely on the US CDC, the government of Canada, the Australian Government Department of Health, and various state or territory health authorities.

Hospital-related transmission of the virus was suspected in up to 29% of health-care workers.7\nThus, to try to avoid nosocomial infection, the hospital set up an innovative infection-control system called the observing system, which has been highly recommended by the frontline medical staff.8\n\nThis innovation originated from the national emergency medical team in field rescue. Negative pressure isolation wards, generally the most dangerous area in the hospital for airborne diseases, are where all the confirmed cases receive medical care as a standard practice. Despite multiple preventive procedures, it is not uncommon that medical personnel in these wards might not be fully aware of their exposure while caring for patients; therefore, setting up an infection control system to provide real-time monitoring and aid for instant correction is of high importance to minimise the risk of nosocomial infection. All infection control observers, appointed by the Department of Infection Control and Nursing in Guangdong Second Provincial General Hospital, have undergone intensive training to become familiar with the requirements for infection control in the negative pressure isolation wards. Herein, cameras cover the entire ward except for the privacy area. The infection control observer monitors medical staff in real time via computer monitors in a separate area (figure). The main responsibilities of the observer are to maintain the normal operation of the negative pressure isolation wards, supervise the implementation of disinfection, ensure a sufficient supply of protective materials, arrange specimens for inspection, and relieve anxiety of the medical personnel while treating patients.\nFigureAn on-duty observer providing instructions to the health-care provider in negative-pressure isolation wards\nView Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The observers pay attention to the medical staff not only during their time in the negative pressure ward, but also during the putting on or taking off of protective equipment when they enter or leave the ward. Although the health-care providers have attended multiple training sessions and emergency drills, in operation (especially in high-stress negative pressure wards) some steps might be omitted or overlooked, thus incurring potential exposure to nosocomial infection. For example, when a nurse helped an elderly patient pull up a zipper in the negative pressure ward, the zipper unexpectedly ripped the nurse's glove. The nurse became nervous, and anxious to continue her procedures. Discovering this situation on screen, the observer immediately soothed the nurse and sent another staff member into the ward to assist. Following the occupational exposure process, the observer then instructed the nurse to remove her gloves carefully, disinfect her hands, and dispose of the ripped gloves. The observer also systematically assessed the risks for the nurse and arranged a quarantine room for medical observation to ensure full safety before she was allowed to return to the negative pressure ward.\u2022 View related content for this articleThe observing system, as a proactive infection control tool, provides immediate prevention against nosocomial infection in negative pressure isolation wards, which offers creative assistance to combat the COVID-19 outbreak. Guangdong Second Provincial General Hospital plans to incorporate artificial intelligence image recognition into the observing system, aiming to enhance the sensitivity and accuracy of instant detection. Implementing and improving the observing system might be a promising endeavor for controlling nosocomial infection of the COVID-19 outbreak and other acute infectious diseases.We declare no competing interests.", "S1473-30992030111-0": "An outbreak of a novel coronavirus was reported in Wuhan, China in late December, 2019, and has since become a global health emergency.1\n\n,  2\n\nThis letter describes the first Vietnamese case of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) acquired from China.A 25-year-old Vietnamese woman who had been in Wuhan for a 2-month business trip returned to Vietnam on Jan 17, 2020. In Wuhan, she lived with two Vietnamese colleagues. They did not visit the Huanan market, which was located 20 km away, and cannot recall contact with anyone who had influenza-like symptoms. All three individuals returned to Vietnam on the same flight. On January 23, the patient presented with coughing, sneezing, fever, and chest pain. After an initial visit to a district hospital, she was transferred to Thanh Hoa General Hospital with suspected severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and the Thanh Hoa Provincial Center for Disease Control was informed. Her two colleagues had similar symptoms and were admitted to another hospital, where they tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Individuals who had substantial contact with the patient and her two colleagues were quarantined and all accommodations and transit methods were decontaminated.\u2022 View related content for this articleOn admission to hospital, the patient was alert but exhausted, with mild chest pain, a temperature of 39\u00b72\u00b0C, blood pressure of 120/70 mm Hg, a pulse of 100 beats per min, and a respiratory rate of 25 breaths per min. The patient had no crackles or bronchi rales on lung auscultation. All other clinical findings were normal. Initial laboratory tests showed a white blood cell count of 3\u00b77\u2008\u00d7\u2008106/L, a red blood cell count of 4\u00b728\u2008\u00d7\u2008109/L, a platelet count of 185\u2008\u00d7\u2008106/L, and a haemoglobin concentration of 127 g/L. Chest radiography showed no abnormalities (figure). The patient's serum C-reactive protein level was 6\u00b76 mg/dL and her serum aspartate aminotransferase and alanine transferase concentrations were 28\u00b77 U/L and 14\u00b76 U/L, respectively. The patient's glucose concentration was 6\u00b78 mmol/L, her serum creatinine was 66 mmol/L, and serum urea was 3\u00b78 mmol/L. A nasopharyngeal swab specimen was obtained to detect influenza type A and B by rapid test, as well as parainfluenza types 1\u20133, respiratory syncytial virus, rhinovirus, adenovirus, and human metapneumovirus by RT-PCR; results were negative for all listed pathogens. A blood sample was obtained for culture and the result was negative for bacterial infection after 5 days. Malaria testing was negative, and cardiac and pleural ultrasound results were unremarkable. The patient's nasopharyngeal specimen was tested for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR at the National Institute of Hygiene and Epidemiology (Hanoi, Vietnam), and the result after 6 days was positive for SARS-CoV-2.\nFigurePatient x-ray\nShow full caption\nView Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The patient was then isolated in a negative pressure room.

Talha Burki reports.As The Lancet Infectious Diseases went to press, the situation with the ongoing epidemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) that started in Wuhan, China, continued to rapidly evolve. As of 9 February 2020, China had confirmed 37\u2008251 cases of COVID-19, an increase of 2657 since the previous day. 6188 of these cases were severe and there had been 812 deaths. Every region of the country has been affected. 24 other nations have reported 307 cases and one death. On Jan 30, 2020, WHO declared the outbreak of COVID-19 a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC). \u201cOur greatest concern is the potential for the virus to spread to countries with weaker health systems, and which are ill-prepared to deal with it\u201d, explained WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom.\u2022 View related content for this articleThere are suggestions from some quarters that COVID-19 is on the verge of becoming a pandemic, the relatively small number of reported cases outside China notwithstanding. The first cases were linked to a live animal and seafood, or so-called \u201cwet\u201d, market in Wuhan, Hubei province, which was quickly closed down. A modelling study published in The Lancet on Jan 31 estimated that, on average, every infected individual is infecting 2\u00b768 additional individuals. The researchers posited that as of jan 25, Wuhan would have seen 75\u2008815 infections with the novel coronavirus.\u201cIf the transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 was similar everywhere domestically and over time, we infer [...] that epidemics are already growing exponentially in multiple major cities of China with a lag time behind the Wuhan outbreak of about 1\u20132 weeks\u201d, wrote the authors of the study in The Lancet. \u201cIndependent self-sustaining outbreaks in major cities globally could become inevitable because of substantial exportation of presymptomatic cases and in the absence of large-scale public health interventions.\u201dAll of which is necessarily speculative. The likely course of the epidemic can only be clarified after several key questions that are still open are finally answered. Crucially, the extent to which asymptomatic and sub-clinical patients can pass on the virus still remains unclear. \u201cMy sense is that asymptomatic transmission is not the major motor of this outbreak\u201d, said Joel Breman, president of the American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene, to The Lancet Infectious Diseases. \u201cWith respiratory illnesses you usually have to get a massive amount of virus, or bacteria, into the oropharynx and the respiratory tract; it is not so easy for that to happen if infected individuals are not coughing and sniffing.\u201dThe specifics of how the virus is transmitted from person to person have also yet to be defined. It is still unknown whether the virus can be spread by the faecal-oral route, for example. The disease pathogenesis is shrouded in mystery. How does the virus replicate in different sites, and how does that relate to the severity of disease? How long patients remain infectious is uncertain, which makes it difficult to decide how long they ought to be isolated. There remains the possibility that the virus is mutating into more or less transmissible forms.Older patients with co-morbidities seem to be most at risk of developing severe disease as a result of infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the proposed name for the causative virus. Based on the figures from China, case fatality hovers at around 2%. But it is conceivable that it is much lower, putting it in line with seasonal influenza, if there are large numbers of mild or asymptomatic infections that are not coming to the attention of the Chinese healthcare system. On the other hand, there may be patients who are dying from COVID-19 in the community. \u201cIt would be pretty hard for places without diagnostic facilities to differentiate between the coronavirus and seasonal influenza\u201d, points out Breman.The extent of the spread beyond China is difficult to ascertain. There have been no reported cases in Africa, despite the one million or so expatriate Chinese who work on the continent. Nor has the virus been reported in central Asia. \u201cThe distribution of confirmed cases is going to be influenced by the extent and quality of the diagnostic screening and testing\u201d, said Jimmy Whitworth (London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, London, UK) to The Lancet Infectious Diseases. \u201cIn some low resource settings there may be unrecognised cases. This is a worry because it makes neighbouring countries and regions vulnerable too.\u201d Wuhan is a major transport hub. Moreover, the virus emerged shortly before the Spring Festival, which typically sees around 3 billion trips within China as families gather together to celebrate the Chinese New Year.The authorities in China have put the Wuhan population under quarantine, and stopped trains and flights out of the city. They have suspended certain long-distance bus routes, including those that depart or arrive in Beijing. In his statement accompanying the declaration of a PHEIC, Tedros repeatedly praised the Chinese response. \u201cWe would have seen many more cases outside China by now\u2014 and probably deaths\u2014if it were not for the government's efforts, and the progress they have made to protect their own people and the people of the world\u201d, he said. Tedros went on to commend China's \u201ccommitment to transparency and to supporting other countries\u201d.Others have been less effusive about how the Chinese government has managed the outbreak. China faced criticism after the death of Li Wenliang from COVID-19 on Feb 1. Li was a doctor at Wuhan Central Hospital. He was detained by the city's police in December 2019 for \u201crumour-mongering\u201d after he warned that there was a mysterious new virus in circulation. A report in the New York Times on Feb 6, 2020, outlined the harsh conditions that now prevail in the city. \u201cWith the sick being herded into makeshift quarantine camps, with minimal medical care, a growing sense of abandonment and fear has taken hold in Wuhan.\u201dWHO reckons that US $675 million will be required to prepare for and respond to COVID-19 over the next three months. It has scheduled a forum for Feb 10\u201311 to co-ordinate the research agenda. The Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations has announced several programmes to develop vaccines against the virus. The organisation's overarching aim is to cut to 16 weeks the time between a new pathogen being gene sequenced and the beginning of the clinical trials for a vaccine.The animal reservoir of the virus has not been confirmed, but phylogenetic analysis has pointed towards bats, after some unconfirmed speculation of an involvement of snakes and pangolins. Regardless, it does seem likely that SARS-CoV-2 originated in a wet market. \u201cWet markets are clearly a risk for transmission of zoonotic diseases to humans\u201d, commented Tom Solomon (University of Liverpool, Liverpool, UK). \u201cChina and other Asian countries may want to review their policy on these markets to try and minimise the risk. This might mean imposing stricter infection control measures or even banning them altogether.\u201dBreman notes that consumers in the Asian countries where wet markets abound expect to buy live animals and use them in their cooking. In which case, socio-cultural considerations will make advocating for their elimination a tricky proposition, which will need to be carefully tailored to the Asian population. \u201cThe wet markets do appear to be a cauldron of exchange of genetic materials from a variety of different animals\u201d, added Breman. \u201cSo at a minimum we should be monitoring standards of hygiene and keeping track of the microbes that are circulating within the markets.\u201dView Large Image\nCopyright \u00a9 2020 Stock/Robert Wei", "S1473-30992030072-4": "Yet again, the world is experiencing a global viral epidemic of zoonotic origin. As of Feb 12, 45\u2008204 confirmed cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and 1116 deaths had been reported in 25 countries. The majority of cases and, at the time of writing, all but one death have been in China, despite efforts in the country to halt transmission through shutting down transport, quarantining entire cities, and enforcing the use of face masks. International flights have been cancelled and affected cruise ships quarantined. At this stage, it is unclear whether the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV)-2 outbreak will run its course, as SARS-CoV did in 2003, or will become an endemic cause of viral pneumonia.In our January issue we announced the formation of The Lancet Infectious Diseases Commission on Preparedness for Emerging Epidemic Threats. The Commission will revisit global preparedness planning and assumptions underlying agreements such as the International Health Regulations. It aims to account for new challenges in preparing for and responding to infectious disease outbreaks. These challenges, which are political and institutional, social, environmental, technological, and pathogen-related, are being brought to the foreground by the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak.\u2022 View related content for this articleOne issue is how prepared the world's health systems are to respond to an outbreak of this scale. It's clear the large number of cases of COVID-19 is testing the health system in China. Yet, China was able to build a hospital for affected patients in a matter of days. No other country could mobilise resources and manpower at such speed. While health systems in high-income countries would be stretched by the outbreak, the most devastating effects would be in countries with weak health systems, ongoing conflicts, or existing infectious disease epidemics. In these countries, it is imperative to rapidly detect and contain the virus at points of entry to prevent community transmission and health systems from being overwhelmed. Health authorities in Africa are on high alert for the virus, given the continent's extensive trade and transport links with Asia. The capacity in Africa to screen, isolate, and treat patients and perform contact tracing is being built under the leadership of the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention and WHO.As in all outbreaks, there is an urgent need to develop effective diagnostics, therapeutics, and vaccines. Several experimental diagnostic platforms are already in use in China and elsewhere. The whole-genome sequence of SARS-CoV-2 had been obtained and shared widely by mid-January, a feat not possible at such speed in previous infectious disease outbreaks. This sequence will allow fine-tuning of existing technologies and development of better diagnostics and targeted therapeutics. Several potential treatments have been proposed, including a Janus kinase inibitor known as baricitinib. However, no antiviral treatment has been approved for coronaviruses, and despite two outbreaks of novel coronaviruses in the past two decades, vaccine development is still in its infancy. WHO has announced that a vaccine for SARS-CoV-2 should be available in 18 months, but achieving this will require funding and public interest to be maintained even if the threat level falls.Social media and sensationalist reporting are challenging outbreak response efforts. Misinformation and conspiracy theories spread on social media have generated panic and mistrust among the general public, diverted attention away from the outbreak response, and impeded the activities of health-care workers. WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said WHO is tackling the spread of false information with a \u201cfour-pronged approach\u201d, including using its WHO Information Network for Epidemics platform to track misinformation in multiple languages and collaborating with social and digital companies such as Facebook, Weibo, and Twitter to filter out false information.How prepared the world was for the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak will surely be discussed in its aftermath. The initial response in China to contain the virus was applauded by WHO and considered much improved compared with its response to the 2003 SARS-CoV epidemic. Internationally, we have seen rapid generation and sharing of knowledge to the benefit of the outbreak response, but also counterproductive actions by some countries, including limiting trade and shutting of borders, to its detriment. With the increasing frequency of zoonotic spillovers leading to human infections and transmission, it's apparent that pandemic preparedness has become a priority for the global health agenda.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)"}
