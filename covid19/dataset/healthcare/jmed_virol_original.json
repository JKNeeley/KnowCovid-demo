{"25722": "1 INTRODUCTION\nSince December 2019, there has been a series of unexplained cases of pneumonia reported in Wuhan, China. The Chinese government and researchers took rapid measures to control the epidemic and carried out etiological research. On 12 January 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) tentatively named this new virus as the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019\u2010nCoV). On 30 January 2020, WHO announced the 2019\u2010nCoV epidemic a public health emergency of international concern. On 11 February 2020, the WHO formally named the disease triggered by 2019\u2010nCoV as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID\u201019). On the same day, the coronavirus study group of the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses named 2019\u2010nCoV as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS\u2010CoV\u20102). On 23 February 2020, there were 77\u2009041 confirmed cases of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection in China. The number of infections has exceeded that of the SARS outbreak in China in 2002.1, 2 To help healthcare workers around the world to better deal with the SARS\u2010CoV\u20102, we review the relevant published papers on COVID\u201019 to provide a reference for future COVID\u201019 research.\n1.1 Sources of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102\nSARS\u2010CoV\u20102 is a coronavirus and belongs to the \u03b2\u2010coronavirus cluster. COVID\u201019 is the third known zoonotic coronavirus disease after SARS and the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). SARS\u2010CoV and MERS\u2010CoV also belong to the \u03b2\u2010coronavirus cluster.3 Zhu et al4 confirmed that SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 was a new \u03b2\u2010coronavirus belonging to the subgenus botulinum of Coronaviridae. According to the current data,5 the early COVID\u201019 cases were related to the Huanan seafood market, and the possibility of human\u2010to\u2010human transmissions could not be ruled out. The WHO report claimed that the SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 could be detected in the environmental samples collected from the seafood market, but it has not yet been determined if a specific animal species carries the SARS\u2010CoV\u20102. A study by Ji et al6 showed that the SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 was a chimeric virus between a bat coronavirus and a coronavirus of unknown origin. By comparing with other animals, they found that snakes are the most likely wildlife repository for the SARS\u2010CoV\u20102.6 The research by Benvenuto et al7 showed that the SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 was only closely related to the coronavirus isolated from Chinese chrysanthemum\u2010headed bats in 2015. Their research supported the theory that the transmission chain started from bats to humans.\nChan et al8 and Hui et al9 confirmed that SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 was a new coronavirus closely related to the bat SARS\u2010CoV. Recently, Zhou et al10 and Wu et al11 found that the sequence homology between SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 and SARS\u2010CoV was 79.5%. They also found that the SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 had high homology with bat coronaviruses. Therefore, the current evidence strongly supports that the SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 was derived from bats, although the intermediate hosts of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 remain to be determined.\n1.2 Epidemiological characteristics of COVID\u201019\nA study by Wang et al12 showed that from January 10 to 24, 2020, the number of people diagnosed with the SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection in China increased by 31.4 times. On 23 February 2020, the number of people diagnosed with COVID\u201019 in China was 1879 times of that on 10 January 2020. They estimated the case fatality rate of COVID\u201019 to be 2.84% based on their patient pool. The authors also found that the ratio of male to female deaths was 3.25:1, the median age of death was 75 years, the median time from the first symptom to death was 14 days, and the median time from early symptoms to death in people aged 70 or older (11.5 days) was shorter than that in people under 70 years old (20 days). These findings suggest the disease may progress faster in the elderly than in the young.\nA study by Li et al5 showed the median age of 425 patients infected with SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 was 59 years, of which 56% were males, the average incubation period was 5.2 days, and almost half of the adult patients were 60 years old or older. In the early stages, the number of infected patients doubled every 7.4 days. The transmission rate of individual infected patients was 2.2. Although 55% of the earliest SARS\u2010CoV\u20102\u2010infected patients related to the Huanan seafood market, the number of unrelated cases have increased exponentially since late December 2019.\nHuang et al13 showed among the 41 patients with SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infections in their study, 73% of the patients were male, and 32% of the patients had underlying diseases, including diabetes (eight patients), hypertension (six patients), and cardiovascular disease (six patients). The median age was 49 years. Out of the 41 patients, 27 patients were associated with the Huanan seafood market. The case fatality rate among the SARS\u2010CoV\u20102\u2010infected patients in this study was 15%. A study by Wu et al14 estimated the transmission rate of individual infected patients to be 0.3. The case fatality rate among the SARS\u2010CoV\u20102\u2010infected patients in this study was 14%.\n1.3 Mechanism, symptoms, and diagnosis of COVID\u201019\nZhao et al15 found that angiotensin\u2010converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) was the receptor for SARS\u2010CoV\u20102. In the normal human lung, ACE2 is expressed on type I and II alveolar epithelial cells. Among them, 83% of the type II alveolar cells have ACE2 expression. Men had a higher ACE2 level in their alveolar cells than women. Asians have a higher level of ACE2 expression in their alveolar cells than the White and African American populations. The binding of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 on ACE2 causes an elevated expression of ACE2, which can lead to damages on alveolar cells. Damages to alveolar cells can, in turn, trigger a series of systemic reactions and even death. They also confirmed that Asian males are more susceptible to SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection. Wrapp et al16 found that the receptor\u2010binding ability of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 is 10 to 20 times stronger than that of SARS\u2010CoV.\nHuang et al13 found that 98% of the patients in their study had fevers, of which 78% had a temperature higher than 38\u00b0C. They reported that 76% of the patients had coughs, 44% of patients experienced fatigue and muscle pain, and 55% of patients had dyspnea. A small number of patients also developed expectoration (28%), headaches (8%), hemoptysis (5%), and diarrhea (3%). Laboratory tests found that 25% of infected patients had leukopenia and 63% had lymphocytopenia. The level of aspartate aminotransferase was elevated in 37% of the patients. Myocarditis was diagnosed in 12% of the patients, and the level of hypersensitive troponin I was significantly increased in these patients. Abnormalities in chest computed tomography (CT) images were found in 100% of the patients. Grinding glass\u2010like and consolidation areas were found in 98% of the infected patients' bilateral lungs.\nZhu et al4 reported three cases of COVID\u201019. Patient 1 was a 49\u2010year\u2010old female with a fever (body temperature 37 to 38\u00b0C) and had coughs accompanied by chest discomfort. Four days after the onset of the disease, her coughs and chest discomfort aggravated, but her fever subsided. Patient 2, a 61\u2010year\u2010old male, also developed fevers and coughs at the initial stage of the disease. Respiratory distress appeared 7 days after the onset of symptoms and worsened within the next 2 days. He was treated with mechanical ventilation. Patient 3 was a 32\u2010year\u2010old male whose symptoms were not described in the article. Patients 1 and 3 recovered and were discharged from hospital after treatment, but patient 2 died after 20 days of treatment.\nGuan et al17 reported 1099 cases of 2019\u2010nCoV infection. They found that fevers (87.9%) and coughs (67.7%) were the most common symptoms. Diarrhea (3.7%) and vomiting (5.0%) were rare. Abnormalities in chest CT images were found in 96% of the SARS\u2010CoV\u20102\u2010infected patients, and lymphopenia was observed in 82.1% of them.\n1.4 Prevention and treatment of COVID\u201019\nAs of 23 February 2020, no COVID\u201019 vaccine has been successfully developed. At present, the treatments of patients with SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection are mainly symptomatic treatments. The study by Huang et al13 reported that the most common complications in patients with 2019\u2010nCoV infection were acute respiratory distress syndrome, followed by anemia, acute heart injuries, and secondary infections. Therefore, empirical antibiotics, antiviral therapy (oseltamivir), and systemic corticosteroids were often used for treatments. Patients with intractable hypoxemia were given invasive mechanical ventilation. Holshue et al18 used remdesivir in the treatment of patients with SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection and achieved good results. Lu19 postulated that, in addition to antiviral interferers and antibiotics, neuraminidase inhibitors, RNA synthesis inhibitors, and Chinese traditional medicine could also be used in the treatment of COVID\u201019. Nevertheless, the efficacy of these drugs still needs to be verified by clinical trials.\nIn the absence of effective treatments, the best way to deal with the SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 epidemic is to control the sources of infection. Strategies include early diagnoses, reporting, isolation, and supportive treatments; timely release of epidemic information; and maintenance of social orders. For individuals, protective measures, including improving personal hygiene, wearing medical masks, adequate rest, and keeping rooms well ventilated, can effectively prevent SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection.172 DISCUSSION\nRegarding the case fatality and transmission rates among patients with SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection, the findings from various studies were different. The studies of Wang et al12 showed that the case fatality rate was 2.84%. According to Huang et al,13 the number was 15%. The study by Wu et al14 estimated that the case fatality rate was 14%. In the study by Zhu et al,4 the number was 33%. Guan et al17 reported that the case fatality rate was 1.36%. According to the official data released by China, the case fatality of COVID\u201019 patients was 3.17%.2 In terms of the transmission rate, Li et al5 showed that the transmission rate was 2.2 per patient. Wu et al14 estimated that the transmission rate was 0.3 per patient. Yang et al20 reported that the transmission rate was 3.77. We think that the transmission rate of 2.2 per patient seems to be more in line with the current situation.2 Different sample sizes and possible viral variations may have contributed to the differences between the studies. Studies with a larger sample size may give a better estimation of the case fatality rate and transmission rate of the COVID\u201019. We know that the other two major zoonotic coronavirus diseases, SARS and MERS which caused widespread transmission have case fatality rates of 9.6% and 35%, respectively.9 According to the official Chinese data, the case fatality rate among the SARS\u2010CoV\u20102\u2010infected patients was much lower than that of SARS and MERS.2\nIn response to the COVID\u201019 epidemic, we believe that the focus of future studies will still be on the development of COVID\u201019 vaccines and effective drugs to treat COVID\u201019. These studies will help further reduce the case fatality and transmission rates among SARS\u2010CoV\u20102\u2010infected patients. Moreover, super\u2010spreaders were reported during the SARS and MERS epidemics.21 Although the transmission rate for SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 patents is about 2.2 at present, the number of cases inside and outside Wuhan is increasing rapidly. With the progress of diagnostic technology, potential super\u2010spreaders may be discovered in the future. In the prevention of the spread of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102, asymptomatic spreaders also need to be focused.22\nIn addition, Sheng et al23 found that viral infections can increase the risk of pulmonary fibrosis. Therefore, pulmonary fibrosis may be one of the severe complications after patients recover from 2019\u2010nCoV infections. The prevention of pulmonary fibrosis in patients recovered from 2019\u2010nCoV infections is an issue that urgently needs to be addressed.ACKNOWLEDGMENT\nThe authors acknowledge TopEdit LLC for linguistic editing and proofreading during the preparation of this manuscript.CONFLICT OF INTERESTS\nThe authors declare that there are no conflict of interests.AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS\nBP and PS had the idea for and designed the study and take responsibility for the integrity of the data and the accuracy of the data analysis.

Genome sequencing of the virus isolated from a patient's lower respiratory tract on 10 January 2020 confirmed that this is a new type of coronavirus. Two days later, the World Health Organization (WHO) termed this pathogen \u201c2019 novel coronavirus (2019\u2010nCoV).\u201d On 20 January 2020, the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China (PRC) formally incorporated the disease caused by the virus, known as COVID\u201019, into the Class B infectious diseases stipulated in \u201cthe Law of the People's Republic of China on the Prevention and Control of Infectious Diseases,\u201d and adopted measures for the prevention and control of class A infectious diseases.2 On 7 February 2020, the National Health Commission named the latest type of coronavirus\u2010infected pneumonia as \u201cnovel coronavirus pneumonia.\u201d On 11 February 2020, the Coronavirus Study Group of the International Commission on Virus Classification named the new coronavirus \u201cSevere Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS\u2010CoV\u20102).\u201d On the same day, the WHO named the disease caused by the new coronavirus as coronavirus disease\u20102019 (COVID\u201019). After evaluation, on 12 March 2020, the WHO announced that COVID\u201019 had reached pandemic status.3\nCurrent investigations have determined that SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 belongs to a new type of coronavirus family, namely, genus \u03b2. Its genetic characteristics are distinctly different from those of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS\u2010CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS\u2010CoV). SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 is more than 85% homologous to bat SARS\u2010like CoV (bat\u2010SL\u2010CoVZC45). The Wuhan Institute of Virology (Wuhan, Hebei Province, China) also obtained evidence that SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 originated from bats and confirmed that SARS\u2010CoV\u20102, similar to SARS\u2010CoV, enters cells by binding to the angiotensin\u2010converting enzyme 2 (ACE\u20102) cell receptor.1 Subsequently, the South China Agricultural University (Guangdong, China) targeted pangolins as a potential intermediate host for SARS\u2010CoV\u20102. A study by Wong et al4 reported that SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 and Malay pangolin recombinant coronavirus share 98% amino acid homology and 89% nucleotide homology for the same receptor binding motif fragment. Zhou et al5 used cryo\u2010electron microscopy to analyze the full\u2010length structure of the SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 receptor, namely, ACE\u20102, for the first time, which will be helpful in developing inhibitors to block entry of the virus into cells. On 21 February 2020, Thi et al proposed that active SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 can be produced and transformed based on viral genetic structure, which is important in understanding and predicting development trends of the virus and the disease.6 On 3 March 2020, Tang et al7 described the genome evolution of 103 new coronaviruses and found that SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 has evolved into two subtypes, L and S, and the virus strain has 149 mutation points more common in the early stages of the Wuhan outbreak; as such, it is speculated that it is more infectious and capable of spreading.\nCOVID\u201019 was predominantly more prevalent among adults more than or equal to 15 years of age in the early stages of the outbreak, and the proportion of confirmed cases among children was relatively small. Since then, however, more regions have launched pathogen detection campaigns and, because younger children cannot wear masks and have not taken other special preventive and control measures, the number of child infection cases has increased significantly, especially in younger age groups and, therefore, should be given high attention.8 On 2 February 2020, the PRC issued a notice on \u201cdoing a good job in the prevention and control of pneumonia outbreaks in children and pregnant women with new coronavirus infection,\u201d which clearly states that children are susceptible to SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 due to the immaturity of their immune systems.1 The latest guidelines also make it clear that all individuals, including children, are generally susceptible to SARS\u2010CoV\u20102.9 Furthermore, children exhibit certain particularities and cannot clearly describe their own health status or contact history, which has contributed to the severe challenge of protecting, diagnosing, and treating this population.10 Due to the increasing global spread of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102, China is now facing the risk of transmission of imported cases, which poses new challenges for the prevention and control of the COVID\u201019 epidemic among Chinese children. At the same time, children with other (ie, comorbid) diseases (such as congenital heart, lung and airway diseases, malnutrition, and tumors, etc) are vulnerable to infection with SARS\u2010CoV\u20102; more specifically, \u201cprone to severe illness.\u201d11 The present article reviews the epidemiological characteristics of COVID\u201019 in children.2 EPIDEMIC STATUS\nAs of 24:00, 26 March 2020, China's 31 provinces (autonomous regions and municipalities) and the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps had reported a total of 81\u2009340 confirmed cases, 3292 deaths, 74\u2009588 discharged patients, and 189 suspected cases of COVID\u201019. A total of 738 confirmed cases were also reported in Hong Kong (n\u2009=\u2009453), Macao (n\u2009=\u200933), and Taiwan (n\u2009=\u2009252). The cumulative number of confirmed cases in America ranks first outside of China, reaching 83\u2009507.12 After the nation's concerted efforts to fight the spread of the virus, the epidemic situation in China was gradually brought under control. On 26 March 2020, there were only 55 new confirmed cases across China, 54 of which were imported, and one of which was from Zhejiang, China. Current case data in China reveal that children less than 18 years of age accounted for only 2.4% of all reported cases.11 As of 15 February 2020, incomplete statistics from China (excluding Hubei region) cumulatively reported 300 confirmed cases involving children13 and, as of 26 February 2020, the total number of confirmed cases in Wuhan, China was 490.14 Two children with COVID\u201019 were diagnosed in Germany on 4 February 20201 and a 5\u2010year\u2010old child in the Philippines was also diagnosed.15 Canada reported the first confirmed case of COVID\u201019, who still carries the virus after rehabilitation and discharge, and is a possible communicator.16 Zou et al17 analyzed the relationship between viral load and symptoms of infection in 18 patients with COVID\u201019, and found that the pattern of viral nucleic acid excretion in those with SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection was similar to that of influenza and that the viral load determined in asymptomatic patients was similar to that of those with symptoms, which indirectly suggested potential transmission capacity in asymptomatic or mild cases with COVID\u201019. Current studies have shown that the incubation period of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 is 1 to 14 days, and most commonly 3 to 7 days.9 However, Guan et al18 described a patient with an incubation period of up to 24 days. Subsequently, Bai et al19 reported a patient with an incubation period of up to 19 days, who was also the first asymptomatic infection in China. Children, generally, have low immunity and some exhibit a long incubation period after SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection. Therefore, children should try to avoid contact with complex populations to avoid being infected by potential spreaders. COVID\u201019 is an acute, self\u2010limiting disease; nevertheless, patients can die, with a mortality rate of 2%,20 and have also been reported in critically ill children.21 Compared with the current COVID\u201019 epidemic, during the outbreak of SARS\u2010CoV, the number of confirmed in children cases (4 months to 17 years of age) worldwide was less than 0.02% of the total number of cases (no deaths were confirmed in children), and children with severe cases accounted for \u223c7.9%, and the vast majority of these had a history of family exposure or adult contacts, while a few had a history of travel in affected areas and a history of exposure in the hospital. Of the 1621 confirmed cases of MERS\u2010CoV reported globally, children less than 19 years of age accounted for \u223c2.2%. Of the 14 pediatric cases (8 months to 16 years of age), nine (64%) were children infected after home exposure, but all were asymptomatic: five (36%) were in the hospital and at home, with a history of internal exposure were symptomatic infections, of whom two (14.3%) exhibited mild respiratory symptoms, three (21.4%) had pneumonia; and two (14.3%) children with underlying diseases complicated by severe respiratory distress died from it.22 Due to its rapid spread and the insufficient clinical analysis of children with SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection, we reference the epidemic characteristics of children in the SARS\u2010CoV and MERS\u2010CoV period to provide clues for effective prevention.3 EPIDEMIOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS\n3.1 Patients with COVID\u201019 exhibit clustered infection characteristics\n3.1.1 Children with COVID\u201019 exhibit characteristics of family\u2010aggregated infections and a longer incubation period than adults\nAs the outbreak spread, it was gradually confirmed that SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 could be transmitted from person to person in places such as homes or hospitals, and even from city to city, and country to country. Children are a very special group, largely due to close family contacts, and may be susceptible to cross\u2010infection. According to existing epidemiological data, 56% (34/61) of children with COVID\u201019 demonstrated clear evidence of transmission through family gatherings.23 China's first newborn COVID\u201019 patient was diagnosed at 17 days of age, first confirmed in the family nursing staff, followed by the parents, who were also diagnosed with COVID\u201019.24 A 5\u2010day\u2010old neonatal COVID\u201019 patient, whose mother was also confirmed to be infected with SARS\u2010CoV\u20102, and a newborn with suspected disease from cesarean delivery was confirmed to be infected with SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 36\u2009hours after birth, followed by his mother who was diagnosed with COVID\u201019 shortly after giving birth.25 On 26 January 2020, a 3\u2010month\u2010old baby and its parents in Hubei Province, China, were both confirmed to be infected with SARS\u2010CoV\u20102.26 On 19 January 2020, a hospital in Shanghai, China, admitted a 7\u2010year\u2010old boy diagnosed with SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection, whose father was diagnosed with COVID\u201019 earlier than the child.27 On 11 January 2020, a case of asymptomatic infection was found in a 10\u2010year\u2010old boy in Shenzhen, Guangdong, China, whose parents, grandparents, and grandparents all developed fever, diarrhea, cough, and other symptoms, and were diagnosed with COVID\u201019 earlier than the boy.28 According to the epidemic situation described by Anhui Provincial Health Commission on 28 and 29 January 2020, a family of six in Huangshan city, Anhui, China, was confirmed to have COVID\u201019, including an 8\u2010month\u2010old baby and a 10\u2010year\u2010old child.1 These cases were found in family clusters. Wei et al8 performed a study on nine infant COVID\u201019 patients, revealing that they all had at least one family member who had been infected with SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 earlier, among which seven infants lived in Wuhan, China or had family members who had traveled to Wuhan. The parents of a 6\u2010month\u2010old baby in Singapore were infected with SARS\u2010CoV\u20102. After the parents were diagnosed, the baby was initially asymptomatic but was admitted to the hospital due to close contact. The baby was diagnosed with SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 the day after admission.29 The average incubation period for COVID\u201019 in children is \u223c6.5 days, which is longer than the 5.4 days reported in adults. The average number of secondary infections transmitted within the family was 2.43. The duration of nasal and pharyngeal detoxification in children is 6 to 21 days (average 12 days).30 An epidemiological analysis of 31 children with COVID\u201019 in six provinces (autonomous region) of northern China found that 21 (68%) had contact with an adult with confirmed disease. One (3%), who had contact with asymptomatic Wuhan return Township staff (without nucleic acid testing), became ill after 5 days, and 28 of these 31 children (90%) were clustered in families.31\n3.1.2 Patients with COVID\u201019 exhibit characteristics of exposure to infection in the foci\nAccording to available epidemiological data, 43% of children with COVID\u201019 (26/61) exhibited characteristics of infection from epidemic exposure.23 Wang et al31 conducted an epidemiological analysis of 31 children with COVID\u201019 in six northern provinces of China (autonomous regions) and found that nine (29%) lived in Hubei Province, China, for a long time. China's foremost critically ill child with COVID\u201019 was seen in several medical institutions at an early stage and may have been exposed to infection in this process, with a history of endemic exposure.21 Wang et al32 analyzed 138 cases in Wuhan, China, and found that if a group of inpatients or medical personnel in the same ward were infected, the suggested source of infection was through the hospital\u2010related transmission. Other studies have reported that the spread of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 from the township level also demonstrates obvious geographical aggregation (especially in Hubei, Beijing, Yangtze River Delta, Pearl River Delta, Hong Kong, \u201cDiamond Princess\u201d cruise ship, \u201cGrand Princess\u201d cruise ship, and other areas are more obvious).33 Therefore, as a susceptible population, children should try to avoid exposure to epidemic sources to reduce the risks of infection.\n3.2 Age and sex distribution characteristics of COVID\u201019 patients\nPatients with COVID\u201019 are distributed among all age groups. A study investigating 8866 cases of COVID\u201019 reported that the majority of patients were 36 to 65 years of age, with only 14 children less than 10 years of age diagnosed with the disease.33 In an investigation of 72\u2009314 cases, Wu et al34 reported that children less than or equal to 9 and 10 to 19 years of age accounted for 1% of the total number cases, respectively. The youngest of the confirmed child cases to date was merely 30\u2009hours of age, and the oldest was 18 years.1 Studies have reported a higher incidence in men than in women (0.31/100\u2009000 vs 0.27/100\u2009000, respectively).33 In a study involving nine children with COVID\u201019 less than 1 year of age, seven were girls8; however, it was not possible to determine whether girls or boys were more susceptible to SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection due to the small sample size. Recently, the Chinese Center For Disease Control And Prevention published a case analysis of more than 70\u2009000 cases of COVID\u201019 in which individuals 30 to 79 years of age accounted 89.8% of the total number of confirmed cases in Wuhan, 88.6% in Hubei Province, and 86.6% of all cases in China. Among them, the ratio of men to women in confirmed cases was 0.99:1 in Wuhan, China, 1.04:1 in Hubei province, and 1.06:1 in all of China.35 Nevertheless, there is still no direct evidence supporting whether I or women are more susceptible to SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection.\n3.3 SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 is highly infectious\nAccording to statistics from the WHO, 4 months after the outbreak of SARS\u2010CoV in 2003, more than 1000 cases accumulated worldwide; the MERS\u2010CoV outbreak in June 2012, as of 30 May 2015, had accumulated 1180 cases. The total number of confirmed cases of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection in China reached 1297 in less than 25 days since the first notification from the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission.36, 37 However, there is no clear evidence that adults are a source of infection in children.23\nThe basic regeneration number (R0 value) represents the number of second\u2010generation individuals that a patient can infect after entering a susceptible population under ideal conditions. The R0 value not only indicates the rate of transmission of the virus but also reflects the potential and severity of the outbreak of infectious diseases.38 Many research institutions have analyzed the R0 value of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102, among which Li et al39 calculated the R0 value of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 to be 2.2. Mahase reported that R0 fluctuated between 1.4 and 2.5.40 Using a sample size of 8866, Yang et al33 calculated a SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 R0 up to 3.77 (95% confidence interval, 3.51\u20104.05). That study demonstrated that the longer the infection period, the higher and longer the reported rate, the higher R0.33 Based on these studies, it is clear that the estimated R0 values were all greater than 1, indicating that SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 is in an epidemic phase and has a strong transmission capacity. Research data from Chen et al41 showed that the R0 value for SARS\u2010CoV was \u223c2 to 5 and less than 1 for MERS\u2010CoV.41 As such, the R0 values of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 (1.4\u20105.5) and SARS\u2010CoV (2\u20105) are similar and significantly higher than that of MERS\u2010CoV.\nTo measure the spread of the disease following the adoption of prevention and control measures, Yang et al studied the effective reproductive number (Rt value), which represents the average number of follow\u2010on cases of infection per infected person at time t. The Rt value after the human intervention will decrease slightly with effective prevention and control measures. The results of the study revealed that from 25 December 2019, the Rt value of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 increased to greater than 1 around 3 January 2020, and peaked at 8 to 15 January, but fell again to less than 1 after 16 January 2020. However, the researchers believe that this did not necessarily indicate a decline in the transmission capacity of the virus, but may have been related to a delay in reporting epidemiological data.33 According to a study involving 1099 patients, Bai et al19 reported that there was asymptomatic transmission of infected patients without excluding the existence of \u201csuper\u2010disseminators.\u201d\nThe Korean government confirmed a \u201csuper\u2010spread incident\u201d on 20 February 2020, in which a surge of 53 cases in a single\u2010day was reported, of which 43 individuals from a church in Daegu were diagnosed.42 In response to this epidemic, a new virus was found in the clinical front line before it spread, which is of great importance to early detection of pathogens and the implementation of effective prevention and control measures. Success in containing the SARS\u2010CoV\u20102\u2010triggered epidemic was largely due to the country's immediate measures at the beginning of the first spread of COVID\u201019, a very important \u201cgolden window\u201d for disease control. A second\u2010generation epidemic will be exponentially larger. Therefore, the application of modern diagnostic technology can more effectively grasp the \u201cgolden window\u201d period for infectious disease prevention and control.43\n3.4 SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection is widespread\n3.4.1 SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 can be transmitted by respiratory droplets, close contact, aerosols, and through the conjunctiva\nAccording to the latest release from the National Health Commission, PRC, SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 is transmitted mainly through respiratory droplets and close contact(s). Spread is also possible through the conjunctiva, and the presence of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 in relatively closed environments with prolonged exposure to high concentrations of aerosols may also facilitate transmission. More specifically, the air\u2010tightness of the environment and the density of viruses per unit volume can affect the spread of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102.9 Because SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 binds to the ACE2 receptor, the virus must first come in contact with cells that express the receptor. Human mucosal cells express ACE2 receptors, and the lips, eyelids, and nasal cavities, which are exposed to the air, have a large number of mucosal cells. SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 binds to ACE2 receptors in close contact and conjunctival transmission without proper cleaning, disinfection and direct contact with eye, mouth, and nose. Teams headed by Lu and Xia both have shown that infectious droplets and body fluids can contaminate the human conjunctival epithelium. The respiratory virus can cause ocular complications in infected patients, which in turn lead to respiratory tract infection; thus, exposure to SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 may cause acute respiratory tract infection.44, 45 Similarly, ACE2 receptors are present in human lung AT2 cells46; as such, an infection can be caused by exposure to respiratory droplets as well as aerosol transmission. To reduce the probability of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection in children and avoid potential hospital transmission through aerosol the route, digestive endoscopy centers, fever clinics, and others have issued relevant emergency plans and management measures during the epidemic period.47, 48\n3.4.2 SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 may be transmitted through the digestive tract\nSARS\u2010CoV\u20102 must bind to ACE2 receptors to cause infection. Accordingly, Zhang et al46 explored the infection pathway of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 and the role of ACE2 in the digestive system after identifying the cell composition and proportion of expression of ACE2 in normal human lung and the gastrointestinal system through single\u2010cell transcription. They found that ACE2 was not only expressed in lung AT2 cells, but also in upper esophageal and stratified epithelial cells, as well as intestinal epithelial cells in the ileum and colon. Therefore, intestinal symptoms of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 may be associated with invasion of intestinal epithelial cells expressing ACE2.46 In an earlier report from Wuhan, China, 2% to 10% of patients with COVID\u201019 experienced gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhea, abdominal pain, and vomiting. Patients with SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection who were transferred to the intensive care unit exhibited a higher frequency of abdominal pain than those with SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection who did not require intensive care, and 10% of patients with COVID\u201019 experienced diarrhea and nausea symptoms in the 1 to 2 days before the onset of fever and respiratory symptoms.49 A study from the USA reported detected SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 RNA in the feces of a patient.50 Given that both SARS\u2010CoV and MERS\u2010CoV can be excreted through feces and remain viable under conditions conducive to transmission, it is speculated that SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 may also be transmitted through this route. Guan et al18 isolated SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 from the urine of a COVID\u201019 patient. This suggests that viral nucleic acids may persist in bodily fluids, secretions, and excreta of patients with COVID\u201019, and that the digestive tract is a potential route of transmission. Viral nucleic acids may also be detected in the cerebrospinal fluid, pleural effusions, and additional specimens from patients with COVID\u201019 in the future. A study by Cai et al30 revealed that viral RNA from feces of children with COVID\u201019 was detected at a high rate, and the detoxification period can be as long as 2 to 4 weeks. Xu et al performed nucleic acid testing on anal swabs from 10 children with COVID\u201019 and found that the duration of positivity in anal swabs and intestinal detoxification was longer. The longest time for the nucleic acid test to change from positive to negative in anal swabs from 10 children was 51 days; the time for a throat swab nucleic acid test in these 10 children to change from positive to negative was generally 1 week. At the same time, this study demonstrated that anal swab testing in children may be more useful than nasopharyngeal swab testing in determining the effectiveness of treatment and determining the timing of quarantine termination.51 However, there was no direct evidence of fecal\u2010oral transmission because the study did not capture live viruses.\n3.4.3 There is no direct evidence that SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 can be transmitted vertically from mother to child\nSince the Wuhan Children's Hospital diagnosed COVID\u201019 in an infant at 30\u2009hours of age on 5 February 2020, it has been argued that SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 may be transmitted vertically from the mother to the child.1 Based on the potential mechanism of vertical transmission to the fetus, potential susceptible cell subsets of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 may not exist at the maternal\u2010fetal interface, and the results show that there is no evidence of vertical transmission of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 to the fetus.52 Chen et al53 tested for the presence of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 in amniotic fluid, umbilical cord blood, and neonatal pharynx swab and breast milk samples at first lactation and detected no virus. All patients in the study were in the late stages of pregnancy; as such, evidence of intrauterine vertical transmission was insufficient. Nevertheless, the possibility of early or mid\u2010gestational vertical transmission could not be determined. In addition, the study did not collect vaginal mucosal samples or birth canal shedding samples; therefore, it was not possible to analyze whether SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection could be transmitted during vaginal delivery.53 It is also uncertain whether breastfeeding leads to vertical transmission from mother to child. There is no direct evidence of vertical mother\u2010to\u2010child transmission; however, newborns can be infected through close contact. Zhu et al54 considered neonates to be at high risk for SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection if they met the following criteria: the mother experienced persistent fever before, during, or after childbirth, and routine laboratory investigations revealed a decrease in lymphocyte ratio; chest CT revealed lung infiltration, based on viral nucleic acid test results and epidemiological history suggesting that the mother is a confirmed/highly suspected case (remove other viral and bacterial infections, mycoplasma infections, puerperal fever, breast swelling, mastitis, and other obstetric conditions); newborn whose mother has clinical manifestations or epidemiological history of infection, but not sufficiently suspicious to definitively diagnose; newborns with a history of infection epidemiology, including those from community sources and obstetric mother\u2010infant same\u2010room sources, family members or caregivers, and visitors who are diagnosed/highly suspected with SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection; and, finally, newborns living in or visiting environments at high risk for SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection.54\nIn summary, although there is no direct evidence that SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 can be transmitted vertically from mother to child, special attention should be devoted to the prevention of neonatal infection in pregnant women with confirmed COVID\u201019. \u201cThe Expert Recommendations for the Prevention and Control of the New\u2010type Coronary Virus Infections in Neonatrics 2019\u201d aim at strengthening preventive measures, effectively blocking the transmission of maternal, iatrogenic, and community\u2010derived SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infections, comprehensively promoting effective control of the epidemic and safeguarding lives and health. Hospitals must devote attention to the health of all neonatal medical staff and actively administer training and, at the same time, perform hospital cleaning and disinfection to ensure that newborns admitted for separate treatment are not exposed to infection risk.1\n3.5 Changes in incidence during the timeline\nBefore 23 January 2020, the incidence of COVID\u201019 increased exponentially, which basically corresponded to the spring transportation period, and the growth of suspected cases was slightly lower than that of diagnosed cases for 2 to 3 days.33 According to incomplete statistics, as of 24:00\u2009hours on 31 January 2020, China reported a total of 74 confirmed cases involving children.23 As of 15 February 2020, incomplete statistics reported 300 cumulatively confirmed cases involving children nationally (excluding Hubei region).13 Thirty days after the report of the first confirmed case of COVID\u201019, the epidemic spread to the entire country (the first confirmed imported COVID\u201019 patient in Guangdong province on 19 January 2020, was the first confirmed patient outside Hubei province35). The first epidemic peak occurred between 24 and 26 January 2020, and then gradually decreased from 1 February 2020.35 Shen et al55 evaluated the role of the Wuhan \u201climit inflow and outflow\u201d strategy in controlling the epidemic through mathematical models. The study predicted that \u201climit inflow and outflow\u201d could reduce all cases of infection and by nearly 70%, assuming that all individuals wore a mask after \u201climit inflow and outflow\u201d and that masks could reduce the risk for infection by 90%. Limit inflow and outflow, the establishment of the Raytheon Mountain, Fire God Mountain, and Fang Cabin Hospitals, delayed resumption of work, suspension of classes,56 and enhanced etiological detection in various places all affected changes in morbidity.\n3.6 COVID\u201019 mortality rate\nAccording to preliminary statistics, the mortality rate among COVID\u201019 patients is 2.38% in China, 4.05% in Wuhan (China), and 0.25% in other countries and regions outside China. Comparing available mortality data of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 with that of SARS\u2010CoV (9.6% [774/8098]) and MERS\u2010CoV (34% [858/2494]), the mortality of patients with SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 nationwide was lower.57 A study analyzing the demographic and clinical characteristics of diagnostic cases using descriptive statistical medical records used the total number of confirmed deaths/diagnosed cases to indicate crude mortality. At the same time, the density of mortality was calculated using the number of deaths in diagnosed cases/cumulative number of days observed in diagnosed cases. In this study, which analyzed 44\u2009672 confirmed cases, a total of 1023 died, corresponding to a crude mortality rate of 2.3% and a mortality density of 0.015/10 person days.354 CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS\nIn children with COVID\u201019, fever and cough are the most common clinical manifestations, with some accompanied by fatigue, myalgia, nasal congestion, runny nose, sneezing, sore throat, headache, dizziness, vomiting, and abdominal pain. A few children do not exhibit fever, but only manifest cough or diarrhea, and even fewer can be asymptomatic carriers. Some children and newborns exhibit atypical symptoms, manifested as vomiting, diarrhea, and other gastrointestinal symptoms, or only asthma and shortness of breath.10, 58 The first severe case of childhood infection reported in Wuhan, China, started with gastrointestinal symptoms, exhibited no obvious early respiratory manifestations, but progressed rapidly to acute respiratory distress syndrome.21 According to clinical characteristics of existing pediatric cases, children with COVID\u201019 can be divided into five clinical types: asymptomatic infection, mild, common, severe, and critically severe.11 One published study reported that among 134 children diagnosed, 89 exhibited fever (high fever [n\u2009=\u200911], low and medium fever [n\u2009=\u200917], and unknown [n\u2009=\u200961]), and 28 exhibited no fever. Fever duration was mostly 1 to 2 days, and the longest was 8 days. Most routine blood examinations were normal, and C\u2010reactive protein levels were normal or transiently increased (three cases >\u200920\u2009mg/L [23, 27, and 47\u2009mg/L, respectively]).58 Of 54 patients with pulmonary imaging data, 38 (70.4%) exhibited ground\u2010glass opacities or exudates, infiltrative lesions; 4 (7.4%) exhibited enhanced lung texture; and 12 (22.2%) had no abnormalities. Five patients, who were negative at the time of throat swab virus nucleic acid testing, were children: two at 9 days after illness; and three at 12 days after illness. Two critically ill patients had a history of underlying disease, and one was after congenital heart disease 7 months with moderate malnutrition; the one other had bilateral hydronephrosis and left kidney stones. Of the 134 confirmed cases of disease in children, if chest imaging was used as the basis for the diagnosis of pneumonia, 36 patients exhibited the common type (26.9%, including seven cases, were subclinical); two cases were critically ill (1.5%); nine cases were completely asymptomatic with normal lung imaging and asymptomatic infection (6.7%); and 87 cases were mild (64.9%).27 The data show that the prevalence of disease in children less than or equal to 18 years of age is relatively low, accounting for \u223c2.4% of all reported cases,59 and clinical characteristics of adult cases (severe symptoms and long detoxification time). In comparison, most children diagnosed with the disease experience mild symptoms, faster recovery, shorter detoxification time, and good prognosis. Xu et al conducted nucleic acid tests on 745 children and 3174 adults with a history of close contact with COVID\u201019 patients or whose family members have confirmed COVID\u201019. They found that only 10 children tested positive, accounting for 1.3% of the total number of children, and 111 adults tested positive, accounting for 3.5%. Among these 10 children with COVID\u201019, body temperature, routine blood tests, and chest computed tomography tests showed that, compared with adults, children with COVID\u201019 were less ill and exhibited less obvious symptoms, and were not typical.51 Although the incidence of critical illness in children is low, the current incidence is sufficient to alert pediatricians. In is important to identify children with COVID\u201019, especially those with underlying/comorbid disease(s), and to treat them early.\nIn summary, special attention should be devoted to children because they are a special group of patients. Through analysis of the epidemiological history of a small number of child cases of COVID\u201019, and a fuller grasp of the epidemiological characteristics of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102, it will be possible to provide more effective preventive measures and treatment policies, and lay a solid foundation for winning the battle against this epidemic.ACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThis study was supported by the Basic Research Project of Sichuan Province (NO.2019YJ0690) and the Major Science and Technology Projects in Sichuan Province (NO.2019YFS0531).CONFLICT OF INTERESTS\nThe authors declare that there are no conflict of interests.", "25883": "1 INTRODUCTION\nThe current COVID\u201019 outbreak with multiple global epicenters has attracted worldwide attention. Thus, with continuously rising numbers of confirmed cases, COVID\u201019 has been declared a pandemic on March 11th, 2020 by Tedros Ghebreyesus, the World Health Organization's (WHO) Director\u2010General.1 Current knowledge of the biology and transmission of this virus remains limited2, 3 and COVID\u201019's final mortality rates are subject to rough estimation. International flight traffic has been majorly affected and many countries report increased COVID\u201019 numbers. Significant global COVID\u201019 epicenters include Italy, France, Spain, Iran, South Korea, Japan, Germany and the initial place of the outbreak, China. So far, different developments regarding growth rates and case numbers have been observed for each respective country as they pass through the initial stages of the outbreak. Although there are different approaches to attain COVID\u201019 containment, the goal of reducing interactions between unidentified infected with noninfected individuals remains unchanged.\nIn a recent study, Wilder\u2010Smith et al4 describe these different concepts in detail, ranging from the quarantine of confirmed and possibly infected individuals as implemented in Germany to the declaration of lockdown in Italy, France, and Spain with individual variations. We know from retrospective analysis that travel restrictions can positively impact case development, as observed in past SARS or Ebola outbreaks.5-7 China's approach in the COVID\u201019 outbreak exceeds the classic definition of local confinement, lockdown, and isolation. With increasing implementation of curfew and lockdown measures in Europe, grave concerns in the population are mounting that previous attempts in handling the COVID\u201019 spread have been insufficient.8, 9\nThe aim of this study is to evaluate and compare case development, growth rate and doubling time during the initial phase of COVID\u201019 exposure for each respective country.2 MATERIALS AND METHODS\n2.1 Data sources\n2.1.1 Confirmed cases of COVID\u201019\nThe total number of confirmed COVID\u201019 cases for Asia (China, South Korea, and Japan), Europe (Italy, Germany, France, and Spain), and Iran were obtained from the COVID\u201019 situation reports made publicly available by the WHO. The present study included data from January 20th, 2020 to March 13th, 2020 as reported by the WHO (see Figure 1).1\nFigure 1\nOpen in figure viewerPowerPoint\nCumulative development of COVID\u201019 cases in China, South Korea, Japan, Italy, Germany, France, Spain, and Iran according to WHO data. Data for the months of January, February and March and magnification of latest case developments outside of China\n2.1.2 Outcome measures and statistical analysis\nThe first 6 weeks after initial reports of COVID\u201019 cases in Italy, France, Spain, Iran, South Korea, Japan, Germany, and China were subject to analysis. This time span of 6 weeks was divided into two intervals: (a) a first 3\u2010week interval and (b) a second 3\u2010week interval. We chose an observation period of 6 weeks as most initial worldwide cases occurred within a 6\u2010week time span (Figure 1).\nFor these two intervals, we measured the doubling time (d) in days and the corresponding growth rate (g). An exponential growth curve with least squarer regression analysis was estimated for both 3\u2010week time intervals for each respective each using the following model:\nC(x) represents the calculated COVID\u201019 cases in total numbers at each time point x based on the current cases Ck and the doubling time d in days. The values for x range from 1 to 21 days according to the length of each 3\u2010week interval. The approximated doubling time of cases is described by d for each time interval. The growth curves were approximated for each interval (see Figure 2A,B). The corresponding growth rate for the same interval was approximated by:\nFigure 2\nOpen in figure viewerPowerPoint\nCumulative development of COVID\u201019 cases in China, South Korea, Japan, Italy, Germany, France, and Spain within the first and second 3\u2010week intervals.

Growth curves of total confirmed COVID\u201019 case numbers are graphically demonstrated including their individual 95% confidence interval (CI; see Figure 3).\nFigure 3\nOpen in figure viewerPowerPoint\nGrowth rates for China, South Korea, Japan, Italy, Germany, France, Spain, and Iran at each time interval (95% CI)3 RESULTS\n3.1 Asia\n3.1.1 Growth rate of total confirmed COVID\u201019 cases during the first and second 3\u2010week interval\nIn Asia, the growth rate of total confirmed COVID\u201019 cases in China decreased substantially during the second time interval (0.025, 95% CI: 0.017\u20100.033) vs the first\u2010time interval (0.16, 95% CI: 0.14\u20100.18) (Figure 3). The opposite relationship was observed in South Korea. In comparison to the first 3\u2010week period (0.13, 95% CI: 0.11\u20100.15), the growth rate of COVID\u201019 cases increased remarkably during the second 3\u2010week period (0.25, 95% CI: 0.23\u20100.27; Figure 3).\nIn Japan, the growth rate was similar between the first (0.10, 95% CI: 0.078\u20100.13) and second 3\u2010week interval (0.11, 95% CI: 0.099\u20100.11; Figure 3).\n3.1.2 Doubling time of total confirmed COVID\u201019 cases during the first and second 3\u2010week interval\nIn China, the doubling time of total confirmed COVID\u201019 cases during the second 3\u2010week interval (27.66, 95% CI: 20.91\u201040.51) was markedly higher than that in the first 3\u2010week interval (4.31, 95% CI: 3.89\u20104.79) (Figure 4). In comparison to the first\u2010time interval (5.51, 95% CI: 4.69\u20106.55), the growth rate of COVID\u201019 cases in South Korea during the second time interval (2.78, 95% CI: 2.55\u20103.04) was considerably lower (Figure 4). The doubling time of COVID\u201019 cases in Japan was similar between the first (6.90, 95% CI: 5.53\u20108.85) and second\u2010time interval (6.54, 95% CI: 6.09\u20107.03) (Figure 4).\nFigure 4\nOpen in figure viewerPowerPoint\nDoubling time of COVID\u201019 cases for China, South Korea, Japan, Italy, Germany, France, Spain, and Iran at each time interval (95% CI)\n3.2 Europe and Iran\n3.2.1 Growth rate of total confirmed COVID\u201019 cases during the first and second 3\u2010week interval\nFor countries in Europe, the growth rate of COVID\u201019 cases increased considerably in the second time interval (Italy: 0.20, 95% CI: 0.19\u20100.21; Germany: 0.32, 95% CI: 0.29\u20100.34; France: 0.32, 95% CI: 0.29\u20100.35; and Spain: 0.36, 95% CI: 0.34\u20100.38) compared to the first time interval (Italy: 0.022, 95% CI: 0.014\u20100.031; Germany: 0.054, 95% CI: 0.040\u20100.070; France: 0.068, 95% CI: 0.054\u20100.082; and Spain: 0.042, 95% CI: 0.028\u20100.056) (Figure 3). In Iran, the growth rate for COVID\u201019 cases was the highest in comparison to other countries during the first 3\u2010week interval (0.20, 95% CI: 0.18\u20100.23) (Figure 3).\n3.2.2 Doubling time of total confirmed COVID\u201019 cases during the first and second 3\u2010week interval\nIn European countries, the doubling time decreased substantially during the second 3\u2010week interval (Italy: 3.40, 95% CI: 3.22\u20103.58; Germany: 2.19, 95% CI: 2.02\u20102.37; France: 2.17, 95% CI: 1.99\u20102.38; and Spain: 1.95, 95% CI: 1.85\u20102.06) compared to the first 3\u2010week interval (Italy: 30.82, 95% CI: 22.41\u201048.87; Germany: 12.77, 95% CI: 9.96\u201017.38; France: 10.27, 95% CI: 8.46\u201012.84; and Spain: 16.60, 95% CI: 12.39\u201024.58) (Figure 4). Similar to other countries, the doubling time of COVID\u201019 cases in Iran remained low during the first\u2010time interval (3.42, 95% CI: 3.02\u20103.89) (Figure 4).4 DISCUSSION\nDuring the initial phase, the rise of COVID\u201019 cases differs significantly when comparing the analyzed epicenters. Although especially European countries (Italy, Spain, and Germany) initially detected very few cases in the first 3\u2010week interval of global COVID\u201019 spread, there is a sharp increase in case numbers during the second 3\u2010week interval. In contrast, Asian countries like Japan and South Korea detected higher case numbers during the first 3\u2010week interval, with a slight but remarkable decrease during the second 3\u2010week interval. This observation is further supported when analyzing the data of case growth and doubling time.\nHowever, the data for China and Iran is inconclusive. Although according to our data, China seems to have reached a plateau phase, the reliability of the data remains uncertain as China has changed the diagnostic criteria multiple times within a short period of time. Similarly, the data for Iran is probably biased and incomplete for analysis.10 Our data indicate that the European countries may not have been well prepared to contain the COVID\u201019 case spread. Many of the current cases in Europe can be traced back to northern Italy and Iran, the two main COVID\u201019 epicenters outside of Eastern Asia. Like China, Iran displayed very low doubling times in the first 3\u2010week interval.\nThis finding may be a strong indicator that detection of COVID\u201019 occurred at later stages with a more large\u2010scale virus spread. This underreporting and insufficient disease detection is a source of continuous concern.11 The overall international COVID\u201019 case development remains concerning and a significant trend of initial underreporting must be assumed. This is a negative development and indicates the possibility of further COVID\u201019 spread, especially as most countries still report very few initial cases. As many counties are at different stages of the COVID\u201019 epidemic, the question arises as to how reinfection can be avoided once curfew and lockdown measures are lifted. Our data support the effectiveness of current containment and testing efforts.12 However, short\u2010time curfew might not be an alternative to long\u2010term containment and testing measures. The concept of wave patterns has been previously described for other pandemic outbreaks. These waves can be experienced for many months.13-15\nLimitations of this study include the quality of provided case numbers, as they might be subject to bias and underreporting. It remains challenging to distinguish the effect of different measures due to a lack of testing kits, insufficient detection, and varying containment policies.\nThe extent of overall testing seems to correlate with the awareness of serious health risks in the observed countries. As official case numbers have increased with the onset of containment measures, one can assume that testing is itself part of the containment strategy.8, 16\nIn fact, evaluation of individual strategies is not possible as only the totality of combined effects and policies of each country regarding quarantine, regional lockdowns, travel restriction, testing, and social distancing can be evaluated.\nThis problem has already been recognized in the evaluation of single containment measures.12, 17 With respect to these considerations, this study focuses on the combination of all measures taken by a country to evaluate the quality of the initial response to this outbreak.5 CONCLUSION\nFollowing the analysis of different European and Asian countries heavily affected by COVID\u201019, our data indicate significant differences in initial growth rates and doubling time. According to our data, European countries seem to have missed effective measures to contain COVID\u201019 at the beginning of the crisis compared to their counterparts in Asia. This is further substantiated by continuously, rapidly increasing COVID\u201019 case numbers in European countries, which call for more draconic containment measures.CONFLICT OF INTERESTS\nThe authors declare that there are no conflict of interests.AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS\nVK: data acquisition, data interpretation, final analysis, drafting of the manuscript, final approval for publication.

To date, there are no vaccines or antiviral drugs capable of preventing or treating HCoV infections.6-8\nTo date, several outbreaks of coronavirus\u2010related diseases have been reported. Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) was the first coronavirus\u2010related outbreak that started in Guangdong, China, in November 2002, and spread to a total of 29 territories, including Hong Kong, Taiwan, Canada, Singapore, Vietnam, and the United States, within 9 months. It infected a total of 8098 people and killed 774 worldwide.9 The second coronavirus\u2010related outbreak happened in the Middle East in April 2012, officially named Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). This virus was first identified in a patient from Saudi Arabia, and later, MERS affected several other countries, including Saudi Arabia, South Korea, the United Arab Emirates, Jordan, Qatar, and Oman. Overall, the virus affected 24 countries, with over 1000 cases and over 400 deaths.10 The outbreak of MERS happened again in South Korea, supposedly from a traveler from the Middle East. It happened during May and July 2015 and infected a total of 186 individuals, with a death toll of 36.11 After 3 years in August 2018, the next MERS outbreak happened in countries of the Arabian Peninsula and resulted in almost 147 infected people and the death of 47. The MERS outbreak had been reported in Saudi Arabia, the United Kingdom, and South Korea.\nIn December 2019, a pneumonia outbreak was reported in Wuhan, China, and on 31st December, it was attributed to a new strain of HCoV, first named as 2019\u2010nCoV by the World Health Organization (WHO) and later renamed to SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses. Almost 2 weeks later, on 11th January 2020, Chinese state media reported the first fatality from the newly discovered virus, which led to the infection of dozens more. Until 20th January, multiple countries reported their first cases, including Japan, South Korea, and Thailand. The first confirmed case in the United States came the very next day in the Washington State. As the spread continued, coronavirus presence was confirmed throughout the month of February in the Philippines (2nd February), France (14th February), Iran (21st February), and as reports started in Italy on 23rd February; many more European countries followed the suit, reporting their first confirmed cases. To date, the coronavirus has affected 181 (by 5th April) countries with more than 1100000 confirmed cases and around 65000 people have lost their lives. With the United States, Spain, Italy, and Germany experiencing the worst cases of outbreaks and showing no sign of alleviation, the 2019\u20102020 outbreak of COVID\u201019 is now officially recognized as a pandemic by WHO. An outbreak or epidemic often refers to a sudden increase in the occurrence of infectious disease, in a particular time and place. Pandemics are near\u2010global epidemic outbreaks, where multiple countries across the world are involved.12\nThe mentioned rapid trend of spread prompts a lot of concerns and questions such as \"How fast is the virus spreading?,\" \"Which policies or efforts could control the disease better?,\" and \"What is the main difference of COVID\u201019 outbreak with pervious epidemics?\" Fortunately, the daily case detection changes are available and can be tracked almost in real time on the website provided by authors (http://iuwa.ir/corona/). The aim of this study is to provide the transmission trend from China to other countries and to report the daily confirmed cases, fatality causes, and surveillance in every country from the first day of the outbreak until 5th April and, also, to evaluate the effect of each government policy in controlling the outbreak of COVID\u201019.2 METHODS\n2.1 Basic statistics\nCOVID\u201019 has currently spread to 181 countries and most national authorities have failed to keep its rapid spread contained.13 WHO reports that it began in Wuhan city, located in Hubei province of China, first reported on 21st January.14 COVID\u201019 categorizes in three distinctions concerning it is infected host's severity of disease.15, 16 To date, the statistics of its reported cases show more than 80% of infected had a mild case of disease, whereas around 14% of infected experienced a severe one, suffering from breathlessness and pneumonia. And about 5% are categorized as critical disease patients, their symptoms include septic shock, respiratory failure, and the failure of more than one organ.\nReports on 5th April 2020 show that the United States, Italy, and China have the most confirmed fatal and also recovered cases. The order of confirmed cases after the United States is followed by Spain, Italy, and Germany, which can be seen in Table 1. Confirmed death cases caused by COVID\u201019 are also observed in 140 different countries (by 5th April), lead in numbers by Italy, Spain, the United States, and France. About 24% of death cases, 26% of confirmed cases, and 32% of recovered cases located in Italy, the United States, and China, respectively, are also shown in Table 1. The overall statistics since 5th April state that there are 1197405 confirmed, 64606 deaths, and 243572 recovered cases, overall. Figure 1 also shows that the COVID\u201019 spread exists in all continents.\nTable 1. Top 10 total confirmed, deaths, and recovered cases for 5th April\nCountry/region Confirmed Deaths Recovered\nUnited States 308850 8407 14652\nSpain 126168 11947 34219\nItaly 124632 15362 20996\nGermany 96092 1444 26400\nFrance 90848 7574 15572\nChina 82543 3330 76946\nIran 55743 3452 19736\nUnited Kingdom 42477 4320 215\nTurkey 23934 501 786\nSwitzerland 20505 666 6415\nFigure 1\nOpen in figure viewerPowerPoint\nTransmission of coronavirus disease 2019\u20102020 (COVID\u201019); blue nodes represent regions with confirmed COVID\u201019 cases, and red nodes represent the regions with COVID\u201019 causes deaths\n2.2 Finding linear relations\nThere is not much known at the moment about COVID\u201019, so there is a small amount of data about its comprehensive effects and behaviors. In this study, relations are assumed to be linear, when, initially the drawn plot shows obvious linear relations, and later, the fitted linear regression line shows a small enough error to preserve the values given and the linear regression results can be interpreted with relative ease. Besides, fitting regression lines with higher order causes overfitting, resulting from the amount of data. There is no evidence yet about the relationship of other conditions with the outbreak and its case fatality rate (CFR), so by using linear regression line, policies and behaviors can be compared. In the prediction cases, by using linear regression, we can compare future trends of countries in earlier stages, with the ones in later stages. By considering the above\u2010mentioned statements, we will find the best linear relation between arrays of data. In some cases, the linear relation can be observed but it may exhibit linear relation with some date shift of others (ie, death cases should have a linear relation with earlier values of confirmed cases, given the fact that it should take time from confirmation to death).\nCFR could be calculated by the following formula:\nwhere Death and Confirmed functions calculate the value of death cases and confirmed cases at that date, T is the date we want to inspect the CFR, and dt is the mean duration of confirmed to death.\n2.3 Global daily statistics\nFigure 2A shows the global confirmed deaths and recovered cases' trend for COVID\u201019 from 22nd January to 5th April 2020. Death cases are excessively lower than the confirmed ones, so we normalized (by dividing the value of confirmed deaths and recovered cases to their maximum respectively) it in Figure 2C to investigate all three trends of cases. For the confirmed cases, there is a huge increase since 11th February, the increased tones down from 11th February to the next day. Furthermore, on 13th February, another sharp increase is reported. It can be observed in Figure 2B which shows new cases for each day (and normalized in Figure 2D). The most reliable speculation for this jump is that on that day, China (the country with the most confirmed cases), for the first time, reported the clinically diagnosed cases in addition to laboratory\u2010confirmed cases,17 in which 13332 clinically diagnosed cases were added to 1148 laboratory\u2010confirmed ones. Since then, China has kept the same reporting method for the confirmed cases. On 23rd and 24th February, confirmed new cases started to increase again. As shown in Figure 2A, the reduction trend is continued (approximately) and the cause of the increase was other countries' growing numbers. So, for more accurate analysis, each country will be investigated separately.\nFigure 2\nOpen in figure viewerPowerPoint\nCOVID\u201019 global epidemic data and statistics of (A) confirmed, recovered, and death COVID\u201019 cases, (B) normalized confirmed, recovered, and death COVID\u201019 cases, (C) new confirmed, recovered, and death COVID\u201019 cases, and (D) normalized new confirmed, recovered, and death COVID\u201019 cases3 RESULTS\n3.1 China: The mainland\nWuhan city located in Hubei province is reported to be the origin of COVID\u201019. On 23rd January 2020, a lockdown in Wuhan and other cities in Hubei was implemented to control the outbreak of the COVID\u201019. A total of 12 other cities in Hubei, consisting of Huangshi, Jingzhou, Yichang, Xiaogan, Jingmen, Suizhou, Xianning, Qianjiang, Xiantao, Shiyan, Tianmen, and Enshi, restricted any form of transportation by the end of 24th January. These decisions were made to prevent the further expansion of COVID\u201019.\n3.1.1 Confirmed cases\nAs measured by Backer et al,18 the incubation period for Wuhan travelers estimated from 2.1 to 11.1 days (the mean incubation period was estimated to be 6.4 days), and also generally the mean incubation period was estimated at 5.2 days which distributed in intervals of 4.1 to 7.0 with 95% confidence.19 By adding these two values, 11.6 days after 24th January (4th and 5th February), the effects should be manifesting.\nFigure 3B depicted the new daily confirmed cases of China outside of Hubei. The peak of the plot is located on 13th February and the daily new cases reduce afterward. This reduction shows that lockdown plays a serious role in the further reduction of cases in China (excluding Hubei province). Even though there is no reason to argue the lockdown's positive impact on Hubei itself, the decrease in new confirmed cases (13th February increase's rationale was described in the previous section) shows that emergency circumstances and movement limitations yield positive results in the reduction of confirmed cases from 10th February. In 13th February 2020, the Chinese government issued a shutdown of all nonessential companies, including manufacturing plants, in Hubei province. Five days later, on 18th February, a drop of new cases could be observed (Figure 3B). Finally, the confirmed new cases in China were negligible from 1st March.\nFigure 3\nOpen in figure viewerPowerPoint\nCOVID\u201019 epidemic data and statistics of China (mainland), Hubei province, and China excluding Hubei. A\u2010C, New (confirmed, recovered, and death COVID\u201019 cases). D\u2010F, Normal data (for confirmed, recovered, and death COVID\u201019 cases). G\u2010I, Confirmed and death cases. J\u2010L, Normal data of confirmed and death cases\n3.1.2 Deaths\nThe number of deaths is far lower than the confirmed cases. So, to investigate the relation of confirmed cases trend with the CFR, the normalized plot will be investigated. By observing normalized Hubei province plot of confirmed deaths and recovered cases in Figure 3K, it can be seen that the CFR trend behaves the same as the confirmation, with a shift (in date). Visually, it could be seen that the value of shift in date varies and increases during this time. In earlier cases, the period of confirmation cases leading to death was shorter. It seems, one reason for this variation is that confirmed cases consist only of just laboratory cases and, by adding clinically diagnosed cases (which existed before but did not count beforehand), the time of confirmation to death increases. In other words, the number of confirmed cases gets closer to the real value, and the cases are announced sooner than they did before. Other possible reasons include the advancements in developing treatments, further delaying fatal cases, and the increase in public awareness, as more people with possible signs of infection come forward to be diagnosed. To estimate the expected value of confirming a case up to the death stage, assuming a linear relationship between the death and confirmed rates, we draw a linear regression line for confirmed and death cases' value, each time increasing the duration and finding the mean absolute error (MAE) of the regression line. Normally, by increasing the duration, following the reduction in investigated points, the MAE is reduced. However, if there is an obvious relation between these two parameters, at the point which they had a correlating relation, MAE will begin to increase (Figure 4A). Wang et al20 estimated the time from the appearance of first symptoms to dyspnea was 5.0 days, to hospital admission 7.0 days, and acute respiratory distress syndrome 8.0 days. Another study found the median days from the first symptom to death as 14 (range 6\u201041) days.21 As seen in Figure 4C, this value is about 11 days in China (excluding Hubei province), Figure 4E depicts value 9 for Hubei and Figure 4A depicts value as 9 days for China. Assuming that the hospital admission is on the same day of confirmation (or a day before confirmation), the mean total of 14 days from the first symptom could be approved in.21 By finding the mean day from confirmation to death, it is possible to find out the CFR in China, Hubei, and China (excluding Hubei province) (Algorithm 1 reports best shifting date value and best linear regression line). To find CFR of 5th April for Hubei, confirmed cases on 5th April should be divided by the death cases 9 days prior (which is 27th March) returning 4.7%. Calculating CFR for China (excluding Hubei) till 5th April follows as confirmed cases on the same day divided by death cases of the previous 11 days that date equals 0.9%. Finally, for China's CFR on 5th April, the confirmed cases dated 5th April should be divided by deceased ones of the previous 9 days (27th March) yield 4%.\nFigure 4\nOpen in figure viewerPowerPoint\nConfirmed death and confirmed recovered regression mean absolute error data for COVID\u201019 transmission through (A,B) China (mainland), (C,D) Hubei province, and (E,F) China excluding Hubei\n3.1.3 Recovered\nRecovered cases are defined as active cases\u2010patients recovered after a certain amount of time, with its trend seen in Figure 3J\u2010L. By comparing recovered cases with confirmed ones, a relation is observed after date shifts. Unlike death cases, recovered cases' shifts are initially longer and reduce over time. The assumed reasoning is that as time passes, more medical treatments develop, healthcare providers gain more experience in handling patients' care and as more people are informed, increasing numbers of them get checked in hospitals at the early stages of their disease, resulting in an even more efficient treatment. However, this reduction does not break the linear relation between confirmed cases and recovered ones enough to be significant. To find the mean date shift between confirmed cases and recovered ones, we apply a linear regression line to different dates by shifting them back until a first local minimum MAE is found (Algorithm 1). Hubei province's recovered mean duration value found is 20 days as shown in Figure 4F, the same value for China (excluding Hubei province) is 20 days as shown in Figure 4D, and finally it is 20 days for China in Figure 4B. To find out the ratio of the recovered cases of Hubei province on 5th April, recovered cases of 5th April are divided by confirmed cases of 20 days prior resulting in 94%. The same calculation applies for China (excluding Hubei) 99%, and finally for China 95%.\n3.2 South Korea: Fast reaction confirmed cases\nFirst confirmed cases of COVID\u201019 were observed on 20th January in South Korea, but the outbreak started around 18th February (29 days later), its death and recovered cases' trend is shown in Figure 5A after normalizing, also the new cases' real\u2010valued and normal form are also found in Figure 5B. Newly confirmed, the deceased and recovered cases are also depicted in Figure 5C and normalized in Figure 5D. In Figure 5E, first days of four country's outbreak are compared. New confirmed and death cases are also depicted in Figure 5G,H.\nFigure 5\nOpen in figure viewerPowerPoint\nCOVID\u201019 epidemic data and statistics of South Korea (A\u2010D), and between counties (South Korea, Iran, Italy, and China). For South Korea: (A) confirmed, recovered, and death COVID\u201019 cases, (B) normalized data, (C) new data, and (D) normalized new data. To compare between countries: (E) confirmed cases, (F) death cases, (G) confirmed rate, and (I) new confirmed cases\nBeing one of the first countries reporting the outbreak of COVID\u201019, the first reported case was on 20th January. However, no outbreak was observed by 18th February, after which there was a significant increase in the number of confirmed cases. A comparison between the growth trend in numbers from South Korea from this date with China's is depicted in Figure 5E with the growth rate of South Korea being more than China's. Followed by a faster reduction in South Korea, patterns are approximately the same between the two. COVID\u201019 spreads from humans to humans;22 therefore, in addition to isolation of people, social avoidance and quarantine policies, and faster detection of infected cases should reduce further growth. Each infected individual, by having contact with others directly or by proxy (in other words by activity), could infect several people, so to reduce the odds of transmission of the virus, faster detection of infected individuals could play a key role alongside lockdown strategies.\nOn the basis of the Korean Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, as of 8th March 2020, a total number of 188518 cases have been screened and tested for HCoV infection.23 More than 10000 tests were conducted on 8th March, and in just 2 days, this number reached to 210144 (indicating more than 20000 tests had been taken in 2 days). Until this date, South Korea reached to 4099 taken tests per million people. The magnitude of this number clearly shows the policy of South Korea and attempts to reduce the duration of detection, through a faster detection strategy.24 Furthermore, the fact that the CFR in the old South Korean affected adults25 (patients above 70 years) is still lower than that of Italian HCoV\u2010affected patients (average 47 years old), which better signifies the role of early detection in controlling the epidemic.\n3.2.1 Deaths\nTo determine the CFR of confirmed cases, especially in countries in which the COVID\u201019 is spreading, the knowledge of confirmation to death duration is essential. To demonstrate a wrong approach, dividing the death cases by confirmed ones on a specific date yields the wrong answers for the death cases that might have been confirmed someday prior. By assuming that CFR has a linear (or near\u2010linear) relation with the confirmed rate, the duration of confirmation to death could be evaluated by fitting multiple linear regression lines. The minimum value for MAE appears for 5 days shift (for South Korea), meaning death cases were confirmed 5 days before. To discern the CFR of South Korea, total death cases should be divided by the total confirmed date of 5 days prior (slope of the regression line also shows the rate).\nAs alluded to before, there are many types of COVID\u201019 concerning acuteness of the disease. The CFR varies depending on the level of infected people already confirmed. If a country manages to diagnose and confirm the infection of a patient in an earlier stage and begins curating the infected individuals or tallying those with mild COVID\u201019, the CFR would be comparatively lower. Such percussion alludes to the apparent lower CFRs in South Korea (1.8%) vs other countries with comparably large outbreaks.\n3.3 The United States: The great outbreak\nThe United States confirmed, the deceased, and recovered COVID\u201019 cases trend is depicted in Figure 6A, as well as its normal form in Figure 6B. On 10th March, both the confirmed and death cases of the United States increased (about 2.9 and 2.5 times, respectively). The huge increase in death and confirmed cases lead the regression line algorithm to define confirmed to death duration in 0 days. However, it would not be possible unless most dead cases are confirmed after death. Accepting the 3 days for the United States (see Figure 6G), the CFR should be about 4%. The high CFR could be alluded to the detection of the infected individuals during the last stages of the illness or reporting on serious cases with higher CFRs exclusively. Compared with China, Iran, Italy, and South Korea, both confirmed and death cases of the United States show higher orders of incrementation. Comparing the increment rate of countries, the United States seems to be in an earlier stage compared with China (outbreak is nearly ended), South Korea (at the ending stage), and Italy (passing the peak of the outbreak). Experimentally, for COVID\u201019, most of the countries in which the pandemic happened, (if the strategy does not change many times) two phases of the outbreak could be introduced. The first one is when the virus spreads increasingly (in each day new cases are more than previous), and the second one is the controlling outbreak in which new cases reduced to near zero. The United States is now in the spreading phase (new confirmed and death cases depicted in Figure 6E,F), the more reduction in new cases would cost more, and a trend with more slope costs more to be flattening. China and South Korea passed the first phase and currently (5th April) it seems they are at the near end of the second stage. The experience of these two countries shows that the second phase will add about 150% of the first stage's cases but it also could vary depending on the strategies undertaken. Considering this calculation, each day in the first phase adds about 2.5 times the new cases on that date in total. Note that, these two phases could be repeated in a country more than once.\nFigure 6\nOpen in figure viewerPowerPoint\nCOVID\u201019 epidemic data and statistics of the United States: (A) Confirmed, recovered, and death COVID\u201019 cases, (B) normalized data for confirmed, recovered, and death COVID\u201019 cases, (C) confirmed cases of different countries (the United States, China, South Korea, Italy, and Iran), and (D) death cases of the same countries, (E) new confirmed, recovered, and death COVID\u201019 cases, (F) normalized data for new confirmed, recovered, and death COVID\u201019 cases, (G) confirmed death regression mean absolute error data for COVID\u201019 transmission through the United States\nIt is advisable to follow the United States in the coming days for more accurate information gathering, considering the latest increment could be caused by wrong data in the previous dates.\n3.4 Italy: High CFR confirmed cases\nItaly reported its first confirmed cases of COVID\u201019 infection on 31st January, later announcing an outbreak around 21 February (21 days later). We have displayed (after normalizing) overall analysis in addition to death and recovered cases' trend in Figure 7B depicting COVID\u201019s trend in the country. By normalizing the plot, death and recovered cases' trend could be seen in Figure 7B.\nFigure 7\nOpen in figure viewerPowerPoint\nCOVID\u201019 epidemic data and statistics of Italy: (A) confirmed, recovered, and death COVID\u201019 cases, (B) normalized data, (C) normalized new data. Comparison of COVID\u201019 statistics between China and Italy: (D) Confirmed cases, (E) death cases, (F) new confirmed cases, and (G) new death cases\nThe plot for new cases is also given in Figure 7C in real\u2010valued and normal form. A comparison between the growth trend in numbers from Italy from this date with China's in the early stages is depicted in Figure 7D as shown, and the growth rate patterns are approximately the same between the two for the first 14 days, showing identical behavior in the increasing numbers of confirmed cases. After day 14, Italy exhibits an incremental increase in confirmed cases juxtaposed to China's. Lombardy, the center of the outbreak in Italy was locked down on 22nd February.\nTo analyze the stage of the disease in the Italian HCoV\u2010infected patients (ie, to find out how rapidly the infected people have been screened and diagnosed), the results of the COVID\u201019 tests of Italy and South Korea can be compared. South Korea has been considered as a reference as its HCoV\u2010related CFR is low enough, indicating that both countries are at the same level of HCoV infection. Till 10th March 2020, a total of 60761 HCoV tests of Italians had been undertaken through their screening program, whereas in South Korea, this number exceeds 210144 tests, more than threefolds. However, the number of the daily taken tests in Italy has been increasing, that is, it was 13000 on 11th March.26\nOn 9th March, a national quarantine was imposed by the Italian government in which any movement of population has been restricted except necessary ones. Consequently, 11 days later, the increase in new cases in Italy stopped, and it seems Italy is in changing\u2010phase days.\n3.4.1 Deaths\nBy comparing new cases of Italy and China which is manifested in Figure 7E (and the overall CFR comparison of the two in Figure 7G), it is clear that new death cases of Italy increased next to China's. Calculating the total CFR of Italy (confirmation to death duration calculated as 4 days), about 14.5% of confirmed cases passed away. Compared with South Korea's rate of 1.8% (eight times than Italy) and China's 4% (72% lower than Italy), the CFR of Italy is too high. Ignoring race and climate as conditions (in which there is no clue of their impact), a strong rationale for this difference should exist. One hypothesis is that some infected individuals are not diagnosed until more serious stages of the disease. This could also explain the increase in confirmed cases, suggesting those infected, remain in contact with others. By comparing hospital beds per 10000 people, the indicator was 115.32 (at 2014), 42 (at 2012), and 34.22 (at 2012) (Iran 15 2014) for South Korea, China, and Italy, respectively.27 Statistically, it is observed that the CFR of COVID\u201019 has had a direct relationship with age (with the average age of death for these three countries, respectively, 28, 38, and 47 years old28) and it also potentially contributes to the increase in CFRs.\n3.5 Spain: Italy's follower\nMassive levels of COVID\u201019 outbreak were reported around 25th February for Spain, as seen by its trend of confirmed, death, and recovered cases demonstrated in Figure 8A. By comparing the early stages of Spain with Iran, Italy, and South Korea in Figure 8C, the trend in 5th April shows Spain has a larger growth rate than other ones mentioned here. The mean age of Spain is 45 year old and hospital beds per person in the country is 29.65 for every 10000 (at 2013); compared with Italy, the mean age of Spain is slightly smaller and hospital beds per person rate is relatively higher, and consequently, it is expected that the CFR should, therefore, be slightly lower. After calculating the confirmed to death cases duration which is 5 days, the CFR of Spain results in 13.5% for Spain, as expected.\nFigure 8\nOpen in figure viewerPowerPoint\nCOVID\u201019 epidemic data and statistics of Spain: (A) normalized data for confirmed, recovered, and death COVID\u201019 cases, (B) new confirmed, recovered, and death COVID\u201019 cases, (C) confirmed cases of different countries (Spain, China, South Korea, Italy, and Iran), and (D) death cases of the same countries\nFollowing by 9th March national quarantine in Italy, Spain proposed movement restriction on 16th March. As seen in Figure 8B, the increasing new cases of Spain stopped 10 days later. After Italy, Spain is also at the beginning of the phase\u2010shifting period.\n3.6 Other countries\n3.6.1 Iran: Good recovery rate\nCOVID\u201019 was first reported in Iran starting with two dead cases on 19th February in Qom (a city near Tehran, Iran's capital), followed immediately by a huge outbreak, displayed in Figure 9A detailing its number of confirmed, deaths, and recovered cases, and normalized in Figure 9B. Officially, Iran has not mandated any city\u2010wide lockdowns, but recently some provinces are refusing nonlocal travelers. Regarding the experiences in China, lockdown strategy will isolate cities to avoid transmitting the growth rate to other cities. However, such policies entail some negative consequences, and therefore, they were not implemented in the early stages of the outbreak in Iran in contrast to Italy and South Korea, where there was a gap between outbreak and huge outbreak (21 and 27 days). On the 10th day of the outbreak in Iran, the total reported, confirmed, and infected individual cases reached 388.\nFigure 9\nOpen in figure viewerPowerPoint\nCOVID\u201019 epidemic data and statistics of Iran: (A) confirmed, recovered, and death COVID\u201019 cases, (B) normalized data, (C) new data, and (D) normalized new data\nTo find confirmed to death cases mean duration, as before, we calculate the minimum MAE, assuming there is a linear relationship between these two. The linear regression algorithm shows the date shift should be zero, which means on average, death cases confirmed on the same day. By comparing the death trend with confirmed cases in Figure 9B, it is obvious that the trend of CFR was not linear. The reported death vs confirmed is too excessive in the early days. It is possible that the shortage of COVID\u201019 testing kits or/and the lack of clinical diagnosis approach caused such unreliable data. Countries at this stage mostly had about 7 days of confirmation to the dead period, so following this assumption the COVID\u201019s CFR in Iran is around 9.4%.\nBy observing the 24th February report, there were 49 active cases (the cases which are not recovered or dead but confirmed as a COVID\u201019 infected) reported (at least 14 cases are new) and the value for active cases in the next day was 79 (at least 30 new cases). Two days later, the reported recovered cases was 49. Suppose, no one was treated in less than 2 days, this results in a 100% recovery of 14 new cases in 2 days and also no active cases after 2 days, marking it a great experience which was reported by Iran's officials. Otherwise, some cases were treated in 1 day. This makes Iran's phenomena intriguing for investigating the details and contributing factors for such cases to find a relation between an individual's physical conditions and their treatment period. However, errors in the report could also explain this information. Using the regression line to find the mean recovered duration shows that the recovery duration for Iran should be around 1 day. Also seen in Figure 9C, the rate of recovery in Iran is quite significant at 37%.\nOn the 20th day of the outbreak, a temporal reduction in new cases could be observed starting on 6th March, persisting until 9th March. Evidently, it is the impact of a nationwide implemented policy reducing working hours 6 days prior (5.4 days is the mean incubation period18). After 4 days, with the arrival of weekends and the following two additional holidays, reports indicate, many people took trips during these dates which are widely assumed as a reason for confirmed cases' rise. Although many companies implemented forms of remote work for their employees (which is estimated to have a positive impact on preventing the growth outbreak), yet many governmental offices working hours returned to their preoutbreak times (naturally assumed to negatively impact the prevention of disease's spread).\n3.6.2 Japan\nThe first confirmed cases of COVID\u201019 in Japan returned from Wuhan on 6th January. However, the outbreak in Japan sped up on 15th February. Figure 10A shows the trend of the outbreak after 15th February in Japan, whereas Figure 10B is normalized to compare confirmed, deceased, and recovered cases. The trend shows that the spread of COVID\u201019 in Japan behaves at a lower rate than China's first dates. CFR is estimated that it is about 4.1%. The CFR is good considering the mean age in Japan, which is 48. By finding out the hospital per bed value of Japan which is 134 (reported in 2012 by WHO), the relation of death cases compared with hospital per bed is more clear. Although Japan managed the early stage exponential rate of COVID\u201019, a reduction in new cases is not observed.\nFigure 10\nOpen in figure viewerPowerPoint\nCOVID\u201019 epidemic data and statistics of Japan: (A) confirmed, recovered, and death COVID\u201019 cases, (B) normalized data for confirmed, recovered, and death COVID\u201019 cases\n3.6.3 France: Unexpected recent changes\nFrance underwent two increments in its rate of confirmed COVID\u201019 cases. The first one was on 25th February and, therefore, chosen as the starting point of the outbreak. The second was from 4th April as shown in Figure 11A. By normalizing data displayed in Figure 11B and calculating the confirmed to death duration which is 7, CFR for France on 5th April results in 19.9%. Considering the mean age as a parameter, which in France is lower than Spain (42 and 45, respectively), in addition to beds per person which is 64.77 (at 2013)27 (higher than Spain), CFRs are expected to be lower than Spain, but the unexpected growth in death cases from 2nd April increases the CFR of France even more than Spain's. The unexpected change also had an impact on the regression line. By comparing the growth of confirmed cases with China, Iran, Italy, and South Korea as depicted in Figure 11C, France has a very high slope in both confirmed and death. More than 1000 new death cases per day from 2nd April and more than 25000 new confirmed cases on 4th April contribute to such a faster increment.\nFigure 11\nOpen in figure viewerPowerPoint\nCOVID\u201019 epidemic data and statistics of France: (A) confirmed, recovered, and death COVID\u201019 cases, (B) normalized data for confirmed, recovered, and death COVID\u201019 cases, (C) confirmed cases of different countries (France, China, South Korea, Italy, and Iran), and (D) death cases of the same countries\n3.6.4 Germany: Handled CFR\nBy observing Figure 12A and comparing the trend with China, Italy, Iran, and South Korea, which is depicted in Figure 12B, Germany had the same COVID\u201019 trend as Italy. The total number of deaths in Germany in 17th March is 24. By dividing the deaths of 5th April to the confirmed on 30th March, 2.36% is the CFR, which is too low at considering the mean age of Germany which is 47. The possible reason for this low CRF is earlier confirmation, which leads to earlier hospitalization for the infected.\nFigure 12\nOpen in figure viewerPowerPoint\nCOVID\u201019 epidemic data and statistics of Germany: (A) confirmed, recovered, and death COVID\u201019 cases, and (B) confirmed cases of different countries (Germany, China, South Korea, Italy, and Iran)4 DISCUSSION\nThe current outbreak of the novel\u2010coronavirus (COVID\u201019), epicentered in Hubei province of the People's Republic of China, has spread to many other countries. The case detection rate is changing daily and can be tracked in almost real time on the mentioned website.\nReports on 5th April 2020 show that the United States, Italy, and China have the most confirmed, fatal, and recovered cases, respectively, and in terms of confirmed cases, Spain, Italy, Germany, and France are following the United States. Confirmed death cases lead in numbers by Italy and followed by Spain, the United States, and France. The daily statistics showed that lockdown is effective in the reduction of incidence of confirmed cases with COVID\u201019 after about 10 days in China, Italy, and Spain. South Korea is one of the first countries reporting the cases after China and the growth pattern of confirmed cases is the same as China's. However, they implement some policies such as in addition to isolation of people, social avoidance, and quarantine policies for infected, and faster detection of infected cases which were effective in a decrease in the new confirmed case and also case fatality. Italy and China have approximately the same growth rate patterns for the first 14 days. The lockdown strategy of Lombardy (the center of outbreak in Italy) seems to have had a positive effect on other municipalities. Unlike China's growth pattern, Iran's incremental trend continued to rise until the 20th day of the outbreak, even though a temporal reduction in new cases could be observed due to a nationwide implemented policy reducing working hours. The CFR in China was 4% (for Hubei was 4.7%). The highest and the lowest CFRs belonged to Italy (14.3%), and South Korea (1.8%), respectively, which could represent the effectiveness of their policies in control of the COVID\u201019. The United States has more than a quarter of confirmed cases. It seems the leading country in confirmed cases of COVID\u201019 should propose a new policy to reduce new cases and go to the next phase of the pandemic.\nSocial distancing is one of the most effective policies to control the past epidemic disease by limiting human to human transmission and reducing mortality and morbidity.29, 30 However, studies suggest that a combination of multiple policies can boost effectiveness. For instance, New York City Department of Health implemented different policies during the influenza pandemic in 1918\u20101919 at the same time and they have the lowest rate of mortality on the eastern seaboard of the United States.31\nDuring the COVID\u201019 outbreak, researchers predicted that the mass movement of people at the end of the Lunar New Year holiday would increase the spreading of disease. Facing this concern, government of China implemented policies which was helpful in controlling the disease such as, extending the holiday so that the holiday would be long enough to shelter the incubation period of COVID\u201019, isolation of confirmed cases in hospitals, quarantining mild or asymptomatic persons in different hospitals, home\u2010based quarantine of people from Hubei province (epicenter of the epidemic), and the most important one was to prevent individuals with asymptomatic infections from spreading the virus.19, 22 Iran is facing this concern as an important upcoming event in Iran is Nowruz which is the Iranian New Year, which recommended prompted policies from government.", "25891": "Objective\nThis retrospective study aimed to analysis the clinical characteristics and complications in death cases with novel coronavirus disease\u201019 (COVID\u201019).Method\nWe collected the medical records of 92 patients with COVID\u201019 in Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University who died during January 6th to February 25th, 2020, summarized the clinical characteristics of complications.Results\nThere were 91 death cases who developed different complications including acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (73/91), myocardial injury (31/91), liver injury (15/91), renal insufficiency (14/91), multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) (14/91) and pneumothorax (1/91).

Lymphadenopathy and pleural effusion were rare.1 INTRODUCTION\nWuhan, China, became the center of an outbreak of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID\u201019) in late December 2019. The epidemic of COVID\u201019 has spread to the whole world within a short time. According to reports from the World Health Organization (WHO), up to 24:00 on 16 March 2020, a total of 80\u2009881 confirmed cases and 3226 deaths were reported in China.1 In addition, COVID\u201019 has affected 150 countries, with 86\u2009438 confirmed cases and 3388 deaths outside China.2 With the further spread of COVID\u201019, the confirmed cases of COVID\u201019 in Korea, Japan, Spain, Italy, Iran, and other countries increased rapidly. The number of new confirmed cases, the cumulative number of confirmed cases, and deaths reported in the world outside China have surpassed that in China. COVID\u201019 has become a serious threat to global health and a significant challenge to healthcare systems worldwide.\nAs a new infectious disease, there is no effective drugs and the vaccine is under development. Early detection, isolation, and treatment can maximize the control the spread of the disease among population. The current gold standard for COVID\u201019 diagnosis is positive results of the nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT). However, there were many cases of positive results be confirmed after repeated NAAT negative,3 and there were asymptomatic infections in patients with COVID\u201019.4, 5 Asymptomatic infections may also become a new source of infection. Therefore, quickly and effectively diagnosing infections play a key role in preventing and controlling the epidemic. The guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of COVID\u201019 (Trial edition Fifth), issued on 4 February, added clinical diagnostic criteria, that was, the suspected cases with typical imaging features in Hubei were clinically diagnosed cases.6 Integrating the first to seventh edition of the guideline, imaging has been playing a pivotal role in the diagnosis and treatment of this disease. Especially in hospitals that cannot perform NAAT, imaging can be a powerful tool for admission screening. Therefore, grasping the imaging features of patients with COVID\u201019 is of great significance for early screening and diagnosis, curbing the occurrence and development of the disease, and suppressing the speed of transmission.\nAlthough many studies have been published on CT imaging of patients with COVID\u201019, most of them were single\u2010center, and in the same hospital or region. Due to the different design and insufficient sample size, the imaging features of the published studies were different. Moreover, there is still lack evidence\u2010based medical evidence on the CT imaging features in patients with COVID\u201019 to guide clinical practice. Therefore, we carried out this study to summarize the CT imaging features of COVID\u201019, to provide reference for further clinical practice.2 MATERIALS AND METHODS\n2.1 Search databases and search strategies\nThis meta\u2010analysis was carried out according to Preferred Reporting Items for Meta\u2010Analyses of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (MOOSE) Statement.7 PubMed, FMRS, EMbase, CNKI, WanFang databases, and VIP databases were electronically searched to collect studies about the CT imaging features of COVID\u201019 from 1 January 2020 to 16 March 2020. We also manually searched the lists of included studies to avoid missing any eligible study. When duplicate studies describing the same population, the most detailed or recent study was included. There was no language restriction placed on the searches, but only literatures published online were included. The search used a combination of subject words and free words, and adjusted according to different database characteristics. The search terms included: \u201cCoronavirus\u201d OR \u201c2019\u2010nCoV\u201d OR \u201cCOVID\u201019\u201d OR \u201cSARS\u2010CoV\u20102.\u201d\n2.2 Inclusion and exclusion criteria\nThe inclusion criteria were as follows: (a) cohort studies, case\u2010control studies, and case series studies; (b) the study population was patients diagnosed with COVID\u201019; and (c) the observation indicators were the imaging findings of chest CT or HRCT.\nThe exclusion criteria were as follows: (a) overlapping or duplicate studies; (b) had no clinical indicators or lacking necessary data which cannot be obtained even by contacting the author; and (c) case reports and studies with a sample size less than 30.\n2.3 Data extraction and quality assessment\nThree researchers independently searched and screened the studies, collected data, and cross\u2010checked. If there was a dispute, it was resolved through discussion or consultation with another researcher. The content of the data extraction included: the first author's surname, the date of publication of the article, study region/country, study design, sample size, age, and CT imaging features; relevant elements of bias risk assessment.\nThe included studies of this meta\u2010analyses were observational studies, so the British National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE)8 was used to evaluate the study quality by two independent reviewers. This evaluation was conducted based on a set of eight criteria, and studies with a score greater than 4 were considered to be of high quality (total score\u2009=\u20098).\n2.4 Statistical analysis\nMeta\u2010analysis was performed using STATA 12 (StataCorp, College Station, TX). Original incidence rates r were transformed by the double arcsine method to make them conformed to normal distribution, and the resulting transformed rate tr was used in meta\u2010analysis. The heterogeneity between studies was analyzed using a \u03c72 test (P\u2009<\u2009.10) and quantified using the I2 statistic. When no statistical heterogeneity was observed, a fixed effects model was utilized. Otherwise, potential sources of clinical heterogeneity were identified using subgroup analysis and sensitivity analyses, these sources were eliminated and the meta\u2010analysis was repeated using a random effects model. Pooled incidence rates R were back\u2010calculated from transformed rates tr using the R\u2009=\u2009[sin (tr/2)]2. A two\u2010tailed P\u2009<\u2009.05 was considered statistically significant. Publication bias was evaluated using a funnel plot along with Egger's regression test and Begg's test.3 RESULTS\n3.1 Literature retrieval\nA total of 4532 related articles were obtained in the initial retrieval. After a detailed assessment based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria, 34 retrospective studies including 4121 patients with COVID\u201019 were included9-42 (Figure 1).\nFigure 1\nOpen in figure viewerPowerPoint\nFlow chart of literature screening\n3.2 Basic characteristics of included studies and quality evaluation\nA total of 34 retrospective studies9-42 that publicated from 6 February 2020 to 12 March 2020 were included.

The current gold standard for COVID\u201019 diagnosis is positive results of NAAT, viral gene sequencing, positive serum novel coronavirus\u2010specific Immunoglobulin M antibodies and Immunoglobulin G antibodies. However, such diagnostic methods also have some limitations, and not all hospitals can implement them. For example, NAAT can only make a positive diagnosis, but cannot judge the severity of the patients; when the viral load is low, it would make a false\u2010negative results; due to the sudden increase of a large number of suspected cases and the shortage of nucleic acid testing reagents, many patients will not be diagnosed in time.49 However, compared with various limitations of NAAT, the lung CT examinations is timely, rapid, and has a high positive rate.49, 50 Most important of all, CT can be carried out in most hospitals. So thin\u2010layer CT scan of the lung is of great significance for the early diagnosis and assessment of COVID\u201019.\nIn this study, we collected the latest articles up to 16 March 2020, included 34 retrospective studies9-42 involving 4121 patients with COVID\u201019 distribution in 31 provincial\u2010level regions in China. The results of meta\u2010analysis showed that most patients presented bilateral lung involvement or multilobar involvement. The most typical manifestations of chest CT were ground\u2010glass opacities, patchy, cord\u2010like, and nodular. Pleural thickening was found in some patients. Lymphadenopathy and pleural effusion were rare. These were basically consistent with the guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of COVID\u201019.6 Lin et al51 also pointed out that the imaging findings of lungs appeared earlier than clinical symptoms, and the CT findings of lungs changed dynamically as the disease progressed, so CT imaging can reveal disease progression. Therefore, in different stages of the disease, CT can be used to evaluate the severity of the disease and efficacy of the treatment.17 For patients with an epidemiological history, a CT scan of the lung should be performed even if there are no clinical symptoms or NAAT negative. If patients with epidemiological history are found that the CT of the lung has typical features such as ground\u2010glass opacities of the bilateral lungs or multiple lobes, they should be highly suspected they are with COVID\u201019. The faster isolation measures should be taken, and further diagnosis and treatment should be performed as soon as possible to avoid the widespread of the disease or loss of treatment opportunities.\nThis study has several strengths including its large sample size and high quality of included studies. We conducted subgroup analysis according to studies' region and sample size. We also conducted sensitivity analysis by excluding each study one by one. The results did not change significantly, indicating the reliability and stability of our results. Nevertheless, some limitations should be noted in our meta\u2010analysis. First, most of our included studies are single\u2010center, which may have admission bias and selection bias. Second, most of our included studies did not clarify the inclusion or exclusion criteria, the course and severity of disease were not the same. Third, all the included studies were retrospective studies, we were unable to control the influence of confounding factors. Lastly, this meta\u2010analysis indicated a significant heterogeneity between the studies. But the subgroup analysis fails to eliminate all sources of heterogeneity, which may affect the accuracy of the results of meta\u2010analysis.5 CONCLUSION\nTo sum up, most patients presented bilateral lung involvement or multilobar involvement. The most common changes were ground\u2010glass opacities and air bronchogram sign. Other common changes included patchy, spider web sign, and so forth. Lymphadenopathy and pleural effusion were rare. But due to the quality and quantity of included studies, the above conclusions need to be confirmed by more high\u2010quality studies.ACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThis study was supported by grants from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (81960343); the Emergency Science and Technology Brainstorm Project for the Prevention and Control of COVID\u201019, which is part of the Guangxi Key Research and Development Plan (2020AB39028).AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS\nData curation was done by JP, PJ, and HL.

As of April 12, 2020, there were 557043 cases of documented COVID\u201019 infection in the United States, and 21952 deaths.1 Our economy except for limited sectors has come to a complete halt as we practice physical distancing to try to mitigate the effects of the pandemic.\nIn the 10 weeks since COVID\u201019 began to accelerate, there has been a flurry of information from corners expected and unexpected to help us with this understanding. Rapid publication of peer\u2010reviewed data has defined the possible risk factors for COVID\u201019, its clinical course, and its possible epidemiology. In this unusual time of a public health emergency, numerous non\u2010peer\u2010reviewed manuscripts have been uploaded to preprint servers, and their unreviewed data and conclusions must be evaluated in this spirit.\nNevertheless, data both published and in preprint form point to a tantalizing hypothesis: that COVID\u201019 infection and its severity can be explained by the concentration of glycosylated severe acute respiratory syndrome\u2010coronavirus 2 (SARS\u2010CoV\u20102) viral particles in the lung epithelium, the concentration of glycosylated angiotensin\u2010converting enzyme receptor 2 (ACE2) in the lung epithelium, and the degree and control of the pulmonary immune response to the SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 spike protein at approximately day 8 to 10 after symptom onset, which may be related to both.\nACE2 appears to be the primary receptor for entry of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 into various epithelial tissues. An envelope anchored spike protein allows entry of coronaviruses into host cells by binding to a host receptor and fusing viral and host membranes.2 Analysis of SARS\u2010CoV, a betacoronavirus most similar to SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 and responsible for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS),3 defined a receptor\u2010binding domain (RBD) of the SARS\u2010CoV spike protein that specifically recognized ACE2.4\nSusceptibility to SARS appears to be primarily dependent on the affinity of the spike RBD to bind host ACE2 in target tissues in the initial viral attachment step, and differences in the affinity of the RBD for ACE2 may determine the zoonotic host and epidemiology of spread.5 Protein crystal structure analysis of the SARS\u2010CoV RBD complexed with ACE2 demonstrated that this differential binding affinity resides in a critical receptor\u2010binding motif of the spike receptor protein, and in particular the composition of amino acids 442, 472, 479, 480, and 487 determine affinity for human ACE2 as opposed to other hosts.5\nPredicted protein structural analysis of these critical five residues in the SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 analogous to SARS\u2010CoV suggested an increased binding affinity to human ACE2 by SARS\u2010CoV\u20102.6 A synthetic SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 RBD was found in vitro to bind and enter cells transfected only with a human ACE2 receptor and no other known coronavirus targets such as DPP4, the target of MERS\u2010Co\u2010V.7 Therefore, it is rational to assume that like SARS\u2010CoV, SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 uses the ACE2 receptor on target tissues as its primary mechanism of entry.\nRecent work with cryo electron microscopy of ACE2 bound to a spike protein fragment of SARS\u2010CoV\u201028 suggests that the viral spike protein is a trimer, with one of the trimer RBD sites exposed to bind ACE2. Additional structure\u2010function studies9 also appear to indicate that the viral spike S protein of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 is highly glycosylated. The S protein is cleaved by proteases into two subunits (S1 and S2) and the S1 subunit is further divided into SA and SB domains, with the SB domain predicted to bind to human ACE2. The S2 subunit is responsible for fusion of the virus\u2010ACE2 complex with the cell membrane, and is highly glycosylated at evolutionarily conserved sites.9\nIt is tempting to speculate that alterations in glycosylation of both the spike protein as well as ACE2 can modulate viral binding. It is also tempting to speculate that alterations in the highly glycosylated and evolutionarily conserved viral fusion subunit could modulate S protein\u2010ACE2 complex fusion with the cell membrane and potentially attenuate human to human transmission.\nThe importance of ACE2 binding by SARS\u2010CoV2 in COVID\u201019 is underscored by the observation that anosmia and dysgeusia have recently been observed in patients with COVID\u20101910 and that ACE2 expression has recently been found to be high in the oropharynx and tongue.112 HYPERGLYCEMIA AND COVID\u201019 INFECTION\nBinding of ACE2 by SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 in COVID\u201019 also suggests that prolonged uncontrolled hyperglycemia, and not just a history of diabetes mellitus, may be important in the pathogenesis of the disease.\nA known history of diabetes (DM) and ambient hyperglycemia were found to be independent risk factors for morbidity and mortality in SARS.12 In a follow\u2010up analysis of 135 patients, high fasting plasma glucose (FPG) was an independent predictor of SARS mortality.13 Diabetes was found in 7.4% of a cohort of hospitalized COVID\u201019 patients and appeared to be a risk factor for severity of disease.14 A history of diabetes was associated with 22.5% of COVID\u201019 intensive care unit (ICU) admissions vs 5.9% of non\u2010ICU admissions in one case series,15 and another recent ICU case series reported 14 of 24 (58%) with a history of diabetes.16 Mortality of COVID\u201019 in patients with diabetes was found to be 7.6% vs 0.9% in patients with no co\u2010morbidities.17\nA possible explanation for a link between hyperglycemia and ACE2 levels in the severity of COVID\u201019 disease could be explained by several clinical observations in SARS and preclinical observations in the NOD diabetic mouse. As noted above, potential changes in glycosylation of the ACE2, as well as glycosylation of the viral spike protein, both possibly induced by uncontrolled hyperglycemia, may alter both the binding of the viral spike protein to ACE2 and the degree of the immune response to the virus.\nIn a subset of 39 patients who had no prior diabetes, received no steroid treatment during hospitalization, and who survived SARS, FPG levels during hospitalization were found to decrease before discharge.13 Twenty of these 39 (51%) patients had diabetes during hospitalization,13 and at 3 years of follow\u2010up only 2 of 39 (5%) did. Autopsy examination of an unrelated individual revealed high levels of ACE2 expression in the alveolar tissue of the lung, the islet cells of the pancreas, the heart, and the kidney. This suggested a mechanism of transient hyperglycemia induced by a transient inflammation of the islet cells of the pancreas by SARS\u2010CoV through binding of SARS\u2010CoV to the ACE2 present on islet cells, resulting in a transient insulin dependent diabetes mellitus, which resolved with resolution of disease.13\nIn a study of NOD diabetic mice, ACE2 protein levels in the lung were putatively elevated when compared to control mice and returned to the control level when insulin was administered.18 By reducing levels of glycosylated ACE2 target in the target lung tissue by glycemic control, this could possibly reduce the number of glycosylated viral binding sites in the lung, and hence possibly ameliorate some of the inflammation and symptoms of COVID\u201019 disease. This also suggests a possible paracrine loop hypothesis for COVID\u201019 infection, where the virus infects the pancreas and lung, leading to hyperglycemia and upregulation of glycosylated ACE2 in the lung, and further virus binding and inflammation. Poor glycemic control could therefore make the disease more severe. In a case series of 138 COVID\u201019 patients, glucocorticoid therapy was used in 44.9% of non\u2010ICU patients and 72.2% of ICU patients,15 and presumably this glucocorticoid use made hyperglycemia, and possibly clinical symptoms, more severe. A recent review of glucocorticoids in viral diseases recommended against use in COVID\u201019 pneumonia and suggested that it could cause harm.19\nIt is interesting to note, that as this article was going to press, that another group has expressed a similar hypothesis.20\nPotentially high and aberrantly glycosylated ACE2 in the lung, nasal airways, tongue, and oropharynx in uncontrolled hyperglycemia could also serve as increased SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 viral binding sites, thus leading to a higher propensity to COVID\u201019 infection and a higher disease severity.\nInterestingly, high ACE2 has a protective effect in various organs.21 ACE2 gene expression is increased by estrogen in a mouse model 22 a potential protective factor for SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection and pathogenicity, as men are more likely than women to both acquire COVID\u201019 and have more severe disease. Recent survey studies found that ACE2 gene expression was higher in tissues of women and in younger adults, an inverse correlation to disease severity.23 A possible explanation for this discrepancy is that gene expression experiments cannot measure posttranslational modifications such as protein glycosylation. In the NOD diabetic mouse model, ACE2 activity in the lung did not rise and then fall with insulin administration, but the amount of ACE2 protein apparently did.18 This is consistent with a rise in glycosylated ACE2, as opposed to total ACE2, since antibody binding to proteins as measured by Western blot analysis could be affected by glycosylation.24 Therefore, it is likely that it is the amount of glycosylated ACE2 receptor, and not simply the amount of ACE2 alone, that is responsible for virus binding and fusion.\nIf true, this argues for better glycemic control in patients with pre\u2010diabetes and diabetes as a potential mechanism to slow COVID\u201019 spread and reduce the severity of symptoms. Additionally, since 3.8% of the American population without a history of diabetes or pre\u2010diabetes has a hemoglobin A1c over 6.1% in random sampling,25 use of high A1c as a risk stratification for COVID\u201019 could have merit.3 ROLE OF ANTIBODY RESPONSE IN COVID\u201019 DISEASE SEVERITY\nClinical information about the timing of the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in SARS and COVID\u201019 is also informative. In a series of 75 patients with SARS26 median time to oxygen desaturation occurred around day 4 after the onset of symptoms, median time to peak viral load occurred around day 10, and median time to peak ARDS requiring intubation occurred around day 10 to 12. In a series of 138 COVID\u201019 patients15 median time to dyspnea from the onset of symptoms was 5 days, to hospital admission was 7 days, and to ARDS 8 days. In a series of 24 COVID\u201019 patients admitted to ICUs in the Seattle area, the median time to hospital admission was 7 days from the onset of symptoms. Another case series from Wuhan suggests a median time from symptom onset to development of computed tomography (CT) scan changes consistent with COVID\u201019 pneumonia to be a median of 5 days.14 It appears that both SARS and COVID\u201019 have a similar clinical course of infection, symptom onset, dyspnea, and oxygen desaturation at approximately day 5 after symptoms in a fraction of symptomatic patients, followed by a worsening of disease to ARDS requiring intubation at day 7 to 10 after symptoms in a smaller fraction of dyspneic patients.\nThis appears to be coincident with a peak in viral load as measured in nasopharyngeal swabs at day 10 after symptom onset in SARS.26 The timing of the ARDS in SARS also corresponded to the timing of immunoglobulin G (IgG) seroconversion.26 Additionally, the neutralizing antibody (Nab) response to the SARS\u2010CoV spike protein in patients who died of SARS occurred earlier in the course of the disease (14.7 days after symptom onset) vs those who survived (20 days), and the Nab antibody titer was higher in those who died of SARS than in those survived.27 Notably, viral load in COVID\u201019 in severe cases appears to remain high 10 days after symptom onset28 and it is tempting to hypothesize that a similar mechanism applies to SARS\u2010CoV\u20102.\nThe study of SARS\u2010like coronaviruses in animal models has been of necessity difficult, in large part due to concerns in preventing a pandemic similar to the one we are currently experiencing. SARS experiments require a Biosafety Level 3 laboratory, and experiments where recombinant coronavirus constructs were produced by insertion of various novel spike protein RBD coding sequences into benign or non\u2010transmissible coronaviruses were specifically banned by the National Institutes of Health in 2014.29\nHowever, experimental information exists on SARS infection and immune response from a Chinese macaque animal model.30 In this model, vaccination with a modified vaccina virus containing the full\u2010length SARS\u2010CoV spike protein, followed by infection with SARS\u2010CoV, induced varying degrees of diffuse alveolar damage in the majority of the experimental animals 7 days after infection. Adoptive transfer of serum from macaques vaccinated with the SARS\u2010CoV spike protein but not infected with SARS\u2010CoV was performed, and this serum induced diffuse alveolar damage at rates greater than control serum in SARS\u2010CoV\u2010infected macaques, indicating that the spike protein neutralizing antibodies were amplifying virus damage by SARS\u2010CoV in the lung, even at low doses of serum. High doses of serum still caused alveolar damage even if they reduced SARS\u2010CoV viral titers, and the damage appeared to be restricted to acutely infected animals. The action of the serum in inducing this damage also appeared to be due to driving of pulmonary macrophages excessively to a pro\u2010inflammatory M1 polarized state, possibly through involvement of the glycosylated Fc gamma receptor. Serum from deceased SARS patients in this study also induced this pro\u2010inflammatory M1 polarization as well.\nThe acute onset of lung inflammation in SARS resulting in ARDS appears to be tightly associated with monocyte/macrophage polarization and function.31 During acute infection, macrophages display a classically activated inflammatory M1 phenotype and express cytokines such as interleukin\u20106 (IL\u20106). High IL\u20106 levels were associated with increased mortality in a series of 191 hospitalized patients with COVID\u201019.16\nIt is tempting to consider that the same mechanism acts in COVID\u201019 as in SARS, where an overactive macrophage M1 inflammatory response, as neutralizing antibodies to the SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 spike protein form at day 7 to 10, results in ARDS in susceptible patients. It is also allows consideration of agents which may interfere with this overly brisk macrophage inflammatory response and perhaps influence the course of the disease, in particular those that blunt but do not completely abrogate M2 to M1 balance in macrophage polarization, as well as viral load, which in SARS appears to be temporally related to the onset of ARDS.\nIt is of interest that in a mouse model of asthma, macrophage M2 polarization is increased by estrogen.32 Additionally, estrogen also accelerates acquisition of an M2 phenotype in a monocyte cell culture model.33 Differences in M1 to M2 polarization may perhaps explain the partial protective effect of female sex in the pathogenesis of COVID\u201019.4 INHIBITION OF PROTEIN GLYCOSYLATION TO BOTH MODULATE VIRUS\u2010ACE2 INTERACTION AND BLUNT M1 MACROPHAGE POLARIZATION IN THE VIRAL IMMUNE RESPONSE\nIt is a tribute to the ingenuity and effort of the medical and scientific community that we currently have multiple agents in clinical trials to help treat COVID\u201019, all of which have a rational basis. However, for an agent to have an effect in blunting the medical complications of a widespread pandemic, where hundreds of thousands of infected patients are at risk of fatal progression of disease, this agent needs to be cheap, relatively nontoxic, and rapidly scalable. Only one of the agents being considered at this point meets these criteria.\nHydroxychloroquine has been used of the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and other autoimmune conditions for nearly 70 years. It has also been used as malaria prophylaxis and treatment for nearly 50 years. It is extremely safe and has been used widely in underdeveloped countries for these conditions, in children and in pregnant women, with little to no monitoring. While there are potential concerns for rare drug interactions with other agents that prolong the QT interval, and there are concerns with retinopathy with long term use, neither of these uncommon complications should be clinically significant if appropriate caution (an electrocardiogram [EKG] before therapy) is employed.34\nThere is a possible rational basis for the development of hydroxychloroquine in the treatment of COVID\u201019 in clinical trials of treatment and prophylaxis. Hydroxychloroquine inhibits SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 in vitro at concentrations achievable in human lung tissue.35 Chloroquine, a related compound, inhibits SARS\u2010CoV replication and spread in cell culture, possibly through reducing glycosylation of the ACE2 receptor.36 Interestingly, computer simulations suggest that hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine are predicted to bind to the active site of the enzyme UDP\u2010N\u2010acetylglucosamine 2\u2010epimerase, which catalyzes the rate determining step in the sialic acid biosynthesis pathway,37 and thus there is a rational basis to assume hydroxychloroquine can interfere in terminal glycosylation of proteins in the Golgi apparatus.\nIn a small unrandomized clinical cohort of 80 patients the combination of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin has been shown to rapidly reduce viral load in COVID\u201019 patients and ameliorate clinical symptoms in the majority of patients.38 In another small randomized unpublished study of 62 COVID\u201019 patients, undertaken after the observation that none of a cohort 80 lupus patients in Wuhan on chronic hydroxychloroquine therapy developed COVID\u201019 infection, 62 patients with mild COVID\u201019 symptoms and signs of COVID\u201019 pneumonia on CT scan were randomized to 200mg of hydroxychloroquine orally twice daily for 5 days and usual care or usual care alone.39 In the hydroxychloroquine arm of this study, 80.6% of subjects had improvement of COVID\u201019 pneumonia findings on CT scan vs 50.8% of controls after 5 days of therapy (P=.0476) and 0% of patients on hydroxychloroquine progressed to severe disease vs 12.9% of control patients (P=not done).\nHydroxychloroquine also can act as an oral hypoglycemic agent, as patients with diabetes taking hydroxychloroquine for rheumatologic diseases had a significant reduction in hemoglobin A1c when compared to methotrexate,40 and thus can serve to reduce hyperglycemia, a possible COVID\u201019 risk factor for disease severity.\nWhile studies are mixed on this topic, and the balance of M1 to M2 macrophage polarization may differ depending on the local microenvironment, hydroxychloroquine has been shown in at least one study to block the polarization of macrophages to an M1 inflammatory subtype,41 and it is predicted to interfere with glycosylation of a number of proteins involved in the humoral immune response, possibly including the macrophage FcR gamma IgG receptor and other immunomodulatory proteins, potentially through inhibition of UDP\u2010N\u2010acetylglucosamine 2\u2010epimerase. In combination with potential other immunomodulatory effects, this could possibly blunt the progression of COVID\u201019 pneumonia all to way up to ARDS where a potential over\u2010conversion to an inflammatory M1 macrophage subtype occurs in response to a postulated brisk humoral immune response to the SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 spike protein around day 8 to 10 after symptom onset.5 CONCLUSION AND SUMMARY\nWhile we await larger randomized studies and more analysis of patient subtypes to determine who, if anyone, will benefit from hydroxychloroquine, in the context of this theoretical framework for COVID\u201019 infection the results to date are supportive, although much caution should be used in interpretation of these early small clinical trials.\nRegardless of the results of larger clinical trials of hydroxychloroquine in COVID\u201019, it is hoped that the above analysis can provide a testable theoretical framework to allow for advances in our understanding and control of this deadly viral epidemic.CONFLICT OF INTERESTS\nThe authors declare that there are no conflict of interests.", "25876": "", "25748": "1 INTRODUCTION\nIn December 2019, a cluster of patients with pneumonia of unknown cause was observed in Wuhan, China. A novel coronavirus was identified as the causative pathogen,1-6 provisionally named as 2019 novel coronavirus (2019\u2010nCoV) by the World Health Organization (WHO). On 11 February 2020, WHO named this novel coronavirus pneumonia as \u201cCOVID\u201019\u201d (coronavirus disease 2019). On the basis of phylogeny, taxonomy, and established practice, the Coronavirus Study Group of the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses formally recognizes this virus as a sister to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS\u2010CoV) and renamed it as SARS\u2010CoV\u20102.7 SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 belongs to species of severe acute respiratory syndrome\u2010related coronavirus (SARSr\u2010CoV) and genus Betacoronavirus.2 COVID\u201019 rapidly triggered a global health emergency alert and spread to 46 countries by 27 February 2020. SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 is the seventh member of the family of coronaviruses that infects humans. Like SARS\u2010CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS\u2010CoV), SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 is responsible for lower respiratory infection and can cause acute respiratory distress syndromes (ARDS). Other human coronaviruses (HCoV 229E, NL63, OC43, and HKU1) are responsible for upper respiratory infections and common cold.8\nBy 27 February 2020, according to open data from China CDC as shown in Table 1 and Figure 1, COVID\u201019 has caused 82\u2009623 confirmed cases and 2858 deaths globally. The total case\u2010fatality rate is 3.46% as shown in Table 1. Because COVID\u201019 started from Wuhan, the capital city of Hubei province with a large population of nearly 14 million people, 58.3% cases are in Wuhan. A total of 1932 health workers have been infected in Wuhan alone,9 which overwhelmed the local health system and resulted in the highest case\u2010fatality rate (4.42%). Excluding Hubei province, the rest of China has 13\u2009045 cases, 109 fatalities (0.84%). Outside of China, COVID\u201019 has spread to 46 countries and has caused 3664 infections and 67 fatalities (1.83%). Overall, the case\u2010fatality rate of COVID\u201019 so far is much lower than either SARS (9.6%) or MERS (34.5%).10 Here, we summarized common and discrete features of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 in comparison to its two predecessors (SARS\u2010CoV and MERS\u2010CoV) in genetics, epidemiology, clinical features, and further discussed challenges for diagnosis and special control measures for COVID\u201019.\nTable 1.

COVID\u201019, coronavirus disease 20192 GENETIC BIOLOGY OF SARS\u2010COV\u20102\nFull\u2010length genome sequences of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 were obtained from early infected individuals related to a wild animal market in Wuhan by different research groups through next\u2010generation sequencing.1, 2, 11 Full genomic length of this novel coronavirus ranges from 29\u2009891 to 29\u2009903 nucleotides (nt).2, 4 All viral genome sequences obtained are extremely similar, showing more than 99.98% sequence identity. SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 is 96.2% identical at the whole\u2010genome level to a bat coronavirus isolate RaTG13 (Global initiative on sharing all influenza data [GISAID] accession no. EPI_ISL_402131) collected from Yunnan province, China, and is 88% identical to two bat\u2010derived SARS\u2010like coronaviruses, bat\u2010SL\u2010CoVZC45 and bat\u2010SL\u2010CoVZXC21, collected in 2018 in Zhoushan, Eastern China.1, 2, 11 The close phylogenetic relationship to RaTG13 suggests bats are probably natural hosts for SARS\u2010CoV\u20102.2 Human SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 have a unique RRAR motif in the spike protein which is not found in coronaviruses isolated from pangolins, suggesting SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 may not come directly from pangolins.12 An evolutionary study13 based on 86 genomic sequences from GISAID (https://www.gisaid.org/) showed three deletions were found in isolates from Japan, USA, and Australia, 93 mutations found over the entire genomes. Of note, eight mutations were found in the spike surface glycoprotein, especially three mutations (D354, Y364, and F367) located in the spike surface glycoprotein receptor\u2010binding domain (RBD), which suggested SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 may rapidly evolve to evade immune response and adapt to other hosts in the future.\nSARS\u2010CoV\u20102 share 79% nt sequence identity to SARS\u2010CoV and around 50% to MERS\u2010CoV.2 However, the seven conserved replicase domains in ORF1ab (used for CoV species classification) of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 are 94.6% identical to SARS\u2010CoV, implying the two belong to same species.1, 2 The receptor\u2010binding protein spike (S) gene of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 is highly divergent to all previously described SARSr\u2010CoVs with less than 75% nt sequence identity to except a 93.1% nt identity to RaTG13. Homology modeling revealed SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 had a similar RBD structure to that of SARS\u2010CoV.11 Further study showed SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 uses the same cell entry receptor, ACE2, as SARS\u2010CoV, not CD26 as MERS\u2010CoV.2 Structural analysis by cryo\u2010electron microscopy revealed SARS\u2010CoVs protein binds ACE2 with 10 to 20 folds higher affinity than SARS\u2010CoV,14 which suggests that SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 may be more infectious to human than SARS\u2010CoV.3 EPIDEMIOLOGY OF COVID\u201019\nTransmission of infectious diseases must rely on three conditions: sources of infection, routes of transmission, and susceptible hosts. As the COVID\u201019 continues spreading, more epidemiologic features of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 have been revealed. On the basis of recently published literatures, we compared transmission features of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 with SARS\u2010CoV and MERS\u2010CoV in Table 2. All three epidemics caused by these three coronaviruses are linked to wild animal markets. SARS and MERS are defined as zoonotic disease, and transmitted by intermediated hosts (palm civets and dromedary camels respectively).11 Recent studies showed pangolins15 and snakes16 at wild animal markets were likely to be intermediate hosts of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102.\nTable 2. Epidemiological characteristics of SARS\u2010CoV, MERS\u2010CoV, and SARS\u2010CoV\u20102\nSARS\u2010CoV MERS\u2010CoV SARS\u2010CoV\u20102\nEstimated R0 2\u2010563, 64 <163 2.68 (95% CI, 2.48\u20102.86)19\nHost of virus Natural host: Chinese horseshoe bats,65 intermediate host: masked palm civet,11 and terminal host: humans.11 Natural host: bats,11 intermediate host: dromedary camels,11 and terminal hosts: humans.11 Natural host: bats,11 intermediate host: pangolins,15 and terminal hosts: humans.11\nVirus transmission mode Person\u2010to\u2010person transmission through droplets,66 opportunistic airborne transmission,67 nosocomial transmission,68 sporadic zoonotic transmission, aerosol transmission,69 and fecal\u2010oral transmission.65 Respiratory transmission,70 sporadic zoonotic transmission,67 nosocomial transmission,68 via aerosols,69 and limited human\u2010to\u2010human transmission.71 Person\u2010to\u2010person transmission through respiratory droplets, contact and fomites,63 zoonotic transmission,72 nosocomial transmission,9 fecal\u2010oral transmission, and aerosol transmission is highly possible.34\nMedian incubation period 4.6\u2009d (95% CI, 3.8\u20105.8\u2009d).67 5.2\u2009d (95% CI, 1.9\u201014.7\u2009d).67 6.4\u2009d (range, 0\u201024.0\u2009d).73\nCase\u2010fatality rate Worldwide (WHO): 9.6%, mainland China: 6.4%, and Hong Kong: 17%.19 Worldwide (WHO): 34.5% and South Korea: 20.4%.19 Wuhan, China: 3%.63\nAbbreviations: CI, confidence interval; MERS\u2010CoV, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus; SARS\u2010CoV, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus; WHO, World Health Organization.\nHuman\u2010to\u2010human transmission was considered as a major transmission mode. According to the sixth version of the guidance for diagnosis and treatments for COVID\u201019 issued by the National Health Commission of China, SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 was transmitted through respiratory aspirates, droplets, contacts, and feces, and aerosols transmission is highly possible. Chan et al6 reported that six familial members got COVID\u201019, but none of them had contacts with Wuhan markets or animals, although two had visited a Wuhan hospital. On the bais of data from China CDC, 58.3% of COVID\u201019 cases are in Wuhan, while the rest of cases are imported from Wuhan. Wuhan is the capital of China's Hubei province, with over 14 million inhabitants, and is a major transportation hub, which increases person\u2010to\u2010person contacts and adds to the possibility of exporting cases to other locations. The early outbreak data largely followed the exponential growth before the implementation of quarantine strategies by governments on 24 January 2020. The basic reproductive values (R0) of COVID\u201019 at the early stage were calculated between 2 and 3.5, indicating that one patient could transmit the disease to two to three other people,17-20 which was higher than SARS and MERS. Phylodynamic analysis based on 52 genomic sequences of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 strains sampled in different countries publicly available at GISAID showed the estimated mean evolutionary rate was 7.8\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u22124 subs/site/year (range 1.1\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u22124 to 15\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u22124), which was in line with that of SARS and MERS, and the mean time of the most recent common ancestor was 73 days.21 With enforced implementation of isolation strategies, R0 was expected to decline in coming days. The mean incubation period was around 6.4 days (ranges from 0 to 24 days).19, 22\nSimilar to SARS and MERS, nosocomial transmission was a severe problem to COVID\u201019, and even worse. A recent retrospective study9 indicated that a total of 1716 health workers were infected, accounting for 3.84% of total cases. Nosocomial infections extremely burdened the health system and hindered early infected individuals from getting immediate medical supports, therefore resulting in high case\u2010fatality rate in Wuhan as shown in Table 1. In Wuhan alone, 1080 health workers were infected, in return case\u2010fatality rate of Wuhan is the highest. Wang et al23 reported that among 138 hospitalized patients with COVID\u201019, 41% of patients were suspected to be infected via hospital\u2010related transmission, 26% of patients received intensive care unit (ICU) care, and mortality was 4.3%. A lot of respiratory treatments for critically ill patients are deemed as high\u2010risk factors for nosocomial transmission, such as intubation, manual ventilation by resuscitator, noninvasive ventilation, high\u2010flow nasal cannula, bronchoscopy examination, suction and patient transportation.24 Unexpectedly, a large portion of nosocomial transmissions occurred through contacts between clinicians and visitors with no or mild symptoms of COVID\u201019 at the early phase of this outbreak. Similarly, presymptomatic transmission occurred through familial25-27 and social gatherings,27 such as banquets, church activities, sports, cruise traveling.\nVertical transmission was sporadically reported in some media but not yet proved. Chen et al28 investigated nine pregnant women with COVID\u201019 in their third trimester who underwent cesarean section. SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 was tested in the amniotic fluid, cord blood, neonatal throat swab, and breast milk samples from six pregnant women with COVID\u201019 pneumonia, and got all negative results. None of the neonates has clinical signs of infection. This result suggested no intrauterine fetal infections occurred as a result of COVID\u201019 infection during the late stage of pregnancy. Previous studies also showed no evidence of perinatal infection of SARS\u2010CoV or MERS\u2010CoV during pregnancy.29 However, a neonate born to a pregnant woman with COVID\u201019 pneumonia tested positive for SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection 36\u2009hours after birth at Wuhan Tongji Hospital.28 It is reasonable to assume that a newborn could be infected, either in utero or perinatally, and, thus, newborns should be placed in isolation to avoid exposure to any source of infection.\nIn terms of susceptible populations, all groups were generally susceptible to COVID\u201019 regardless of age or sex.9 Patients aged from 30 to 79 accounted for 86.6% of all cases.9 The median age of the patients was 47 years.30\nUnlike SARS and MERS, patients diagnosed as COVID\u201019 have presented with high viral loads even when those have no fever or mild symptoms.31 High titers of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 were detected in travelers who recently visited Wuhan and have no fever or mild symptoms in the United States31 and Germany32 and other places.33 A study showed high viral loads were detected in upper respiratory specimens of patients with COVID\u201019, and viral shedding pattern of patients resembles that of patients with influenza.33 This suggests SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 may stay around for some time like influenza viruses.4 CLINICAL FEATURES OF COVID\u201019\nThe full spectrum of disease severity as shown in the guidelines for diagnosis and treatments for COVID\u20101934 issued by the National Health Commission of China had been updated for six times by 19 February 2020. COVID\u201019 is now classified as four levels based on the severity of symptoms: mild, moderate, severe, and critical. Mild patients only present mild symptoms without radiographic features. Moderate patients present with fever, respiratory symptoms, and radiographic features. Severe patients meet one of three criteria: (a) dyspnea, RR greater than 30\u2009times/min, (b) oxygen saturation less than 93% in ambient air, and (c) PaO2/FiO2 less than 300 mm\u2009Hg. Critical patients meet one of three criteria: (a) respiratory failure, (b) septic shock, and (c) multiple organ failure. The largest epidemiology study done by China CDC9 showed among 44\u2009672 confirmed cases, 86.6% of confirmed patients were aged 30 to 79 years, 80.9% were considered mild/common pneumonia, 13.8% were severe cases, and 4.7% were critical cases. Case\u2010fatality rate for critical patients was 49%. Patients with comorbidities (cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, hypertension, and cancers) had higher case\u2010fatality rates (10.5%, 7.3%, 6.5%, 6.0%, and 5.6%, respectively) than those without comorbidities (0.9%). This indicated comorbidities were high\u2010risk factors for patients with COVID\u201019.\nClinical symptoms of severe and critical patients with COVID\u201019 resembled most of SARS and MERS as listed in Table 3, including fever, dry cough, myalgia, fatigue, dyspnea, anorexia, diarrhea, ARDS, arrhythmia, acute kidney injury, various degrees of liver damage, and septic shock. Common symptoms of hospitalized patients with COVID\u201019 included fever (98.6%), fatigue (69.6%), dry cough,23, 35 and diarrhea.36 Less common symptoms included muscle ache, confusion, headache, sore throat, rhinorrhoea, chest pain, sputum production,36 and nausea and vomiting.35 Severe complications included ARDS, RNAaemia, acute cardiac injury, and multiple organ failure.36 The median time from first symptom to dyspnea was 5.0 days, to hospital admission was 7.0 days, and to ARDS was 8.0 days.23 A few patients had symptoms, such as nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat, myalgia, and diarrhea.34 Most patients had a good prognosis according to the guidelines for diagnosis and treatments for COVID\u201019.34 Wang et al23 reported that age and comorbidity may be risk factors. A recent study showed that renal damage was caused by virus and antiviral drugs.37 Meanwhile, SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 might cause various degrees of liver damage38 and damages in testicular tissue.37 Mild patients showed only low fever, mild fatigue, and no pneumonia. Severe patients usually had dyspnea/hypoxemia 1 week after the onset. Critical patients could quickly progress to ARDS, shock, metabolic acidosis, coagulation dysfunction, and multiple organ functional failure.34 Dyspnea, abdominal pain, and anorexia were also more common in critically ill patients.23 It had to be noted that severe and critically ill patients might present moderate to low fever, even without obvious fever.34\nTable 3.

Laboratory abnormalities were similar to those previously observed in patients with MERS\u2010CoV and SARS\u2010CoV infection.23, 39 Most patients had elevated C reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and normal procalcitonin. In severe cases, D\u2010dimer increased and peripheral blood lymphocytes progressively decreased. Severe and critically ill patients had elevated inflammatory factors.34 In the nonsurvivors, the neutrophil count, D\u2010dimer, blood urea, and creatinine levels continued to increase.23\nX\u2010ray and chest computed tomographic scans showed bilateral patchy shadows or ground\u2010glass opacity in the lungs of moderate and severe patients.35 It had to be noted that majority of COVID\u201019 patients with mild/moderate symptoms can quickly transit into severe or critical statuses if without immediate care.40 These virus\u2010 carriers with no or mild symptoms can fool health workers and could be huge challenges for controlling this epidemic.5 CHALLENGES FOR DIAGNOSIS OF COVID\u201019\nDiagnosis of COVID\u201019 has been facing difficulties because laboratory detections and radiographic images are not always in agreement with clinical features and contact histories of patients.41 Laboratory detections included genomic sequencing, reverse\u2010transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT\u2010PCR), and serological methods (such as enzyme\u2010linked immunoassay [ELISA]). In addition, because manifestations of the novel coronavirus pneumonia were diverse and changed rapidly, judging by radiographic images for early detection and evaluation of disease severity and follow\u2010up of patients were heavily depended on experience.40 As a result, clinically suspected patients, with a history of exposure, fever, and positive findings on chest CT, had to receive rapid diagnosis with molecular technologies.42\nGenomic sequencing was a way for identifying disease\u2010associated pathogens2, 11 at the beginning of the outbreak of COVID\u201019. But it was too complicated and expensive for a large scale of detections. RT\u2010PCR methods based on spike gene and N gene developed by several companies and China CDC were widely used for detecting viral RNA, and were considered a gold standard.2, 11, 34, 43 However, this method had its limitations, such as short detection window from nasopharyngeal swabs, false sampling, cross\u2010contamination of samples, and inconsistence of sample collections and preparations.\nRT\u2010PCR methods generated false\u2010positive or false\u2010negative results,42, 44 which caused troubles for isolating sources of infections and determining hospitalization days. According to current guidelines for diagnosis and treatments for COVID\u201019, if one is tested by RT\u2010PCR negative for twice, he/she is considered the cured and should be discharged. However, some of cured and discharged patients later have been tested positive by RT\u2010PCR.45 Presumably, many factors mentioned above could lead to \u201cfalse negative\u201d in these cases. On the other hand, a proportion of patients with fever or pneumonia were wrongly isolated together with other confirmed patients with COVID\u201019 in general medical wards because RT\u2010PCR could produce false\u2010positive results due to sample contaminations or other reasons. These patients turned out to be infected by influenza or other pneumonia associated pathogens. A recent large diagnostic study42 showed 316 patients were confirmed infected with multiple respiratory pathogens including common HCoV (5 cases), influenza A virus (2 cases), rhinovirus (12 cases), and influenza A H3N2 (12 cases), respiratory syncytial virus (7 cases), influenza B virus (6 cases), and metapneumovirus (4 cases). In addition, RT\u2010PCR methods could generate inconsistent results. A fluorescence\u2010based quantitative PCR kit urgently distributed by the China CDC was designed to detect NP and ORF1ab regions on the SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 genome. Sometimes, the results from the two pairs of primers did not agree with each other.42 Besides technical difficulties, deletions and mutations in genome of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 occurred during viral evolution may also contribute to false results generated by RT\u2010PCR.\nELISA was highly recommended and expected to improve detection rate for COVID\u20101942 because sampling blood was much less stringent than sampling nasal or oral swabs for detecting viruses, and antibodies allows much longer detection window than viruses. Furthermore, ELISA had a quick turnaround time and relatively low costs. The strength of ELISA methods could make up of the shortages of RT\u2010PCR.44 ELISA method based on SARSr\u2010CoV Rp3 nucleocapsid protein was successfully developed to detect immunoglobulin M and immunoglobulin G against SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 in early COVID\u201019 cases.2 A caveat is that this ELISA method may generate false\u2010positive results as N protein is the most conservative viral protein among human \u03b2\u2010coronavirus genus.46 Antigens used in ELISA may react with antibodies against four other HCoV that occurred in common colds. S protein is the most diverse protein and may be good candidate for ELISA development.2\nDifferential diagnosis is also critical for confirming cases of COVID\u201019. Winter usually has higher prevalence of flu and other pathogens associated pneumonia. In all, diagnosis of COVID\u201019 has to be based on comprehensive understanding of epidemic history, clinical features, radiographic features, and laboratory detection.346 POTENTIAL INTERVENTIONS\nIsolation is still the most effective means of containing COVID\u201019.47 Effective surveillance is the prerequisite for blocking the source of infections. Many methods are applied to recognize source of infections (laboratory confirmed patients, suspected infected persons, and closely contacted persons), including community registration, tracing suspected carrier by cell phones. Those evaluated at moderate/high risk of exposure are encouraged to report conditions daily. General medical wards were used to collectively monitor and treat mild patients.42, 48\nTherapeutics of COVID\u201019 primarily include symptomatic treatments and antiviral therapies. Early supportive interventions are critical for treating mild patients including nutrient supplements, oxygen therapy, Chinese herbal medicine, and antibacterial therapy. Patients infected with COVID\u201019 are mostly middle aged and elderly generally with low resistance to infection.42 Supportive treatments are necessary for patients with mild symptoms at the early stage of infection. For critically ill patients, high\u2010flow oxygen therapy, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, glucocorticoid therapy, and administration of convalescent plasma are applied.34, 49 There are several suggested antiviral treatments: lopinavir/ritonavir, ribavirin, interferon\u2010\u03b1, chloroquine phosphate, and Abidor. It is not recommended to use three or more antiviral drugs above simultaneously.34, 50, 51 Combinational use of lopinavir, ritonavir, and ribavirin in the treatment of SARS was reported to be associated with better outcome.52 It was previously reported that chloroquine could inhibit SARS\u2010CoV53 and was tested for treating COVID\u201019 in clinical trials in China. Recently, several studies suggested remdesivir effectively inhibit RNA viruses (including SARS/MERS\u2010CoV/2019\u2010nCoV) infection.51, 54, 55 Remdesivir was used on the first patient in the United States and showed promising results.31 Currently, three clinical trials were registered for testing remdesivir on the treatment of COVID\u201019 (http://clinicaltrials.gov). In addition, a pan\u2010coronavirus fusion inhibitor EK1 targeting the HR1 domain of HCoV spike was reported to have the potential to treat COVID\u201019.56 Convalescent sera were used for treating critically ill patients and show some effects.57\nRecent report indicated that transmission may occur from individuals with no symptoms or from convalescents.42, 58 It is likely that SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 will stay around for some time and even coevolve with its hosts. Due to uncertainty of clinical spectrum of virus carriers, vaccination is highly recommended for susceptible populations, especially for those with comorbidities (cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, hypertension, and cancers). Vaccines based on S protein, T cell epitopes, and RBD have been studied for SARS and MERS.56, 59-61 Recently, an oral vaccine based on yeast expressed S protein developed by a group of scientists in Tianjing University of China provoked a lot of interests after it was reported by Jingyun News. However, it needs to be further tested in clinical trials. On 24 February 2020, Moderna, a pharmaceutical company in the United States announced that its experimental messenger RNA (mRNA) COVID\u201019 vaccine, known as mRNA\u20101273, was ready for human testing and the initial batch of the vaccine were shipped to US government researchers from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. We have reasons to believe that vaccines would be a way to prevent viral infection because convalescent sera could improve conditions of critically ill patients.57 In addition to the protective and therapeutic measures mentioned above, psychological interventions were expected to be helpful for infection control.627 CONCLUSION\nLatest literatures and official data from China CDC revealed the epidemic of COVID\u201019 caused more infections and deaths than either SARS or MERS by far, despite the fact that its case\u2010fatality rate is much lower. SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 appears to be more infectious than SARS\u2010CoV or MERS\u2010CoV based on R0 values calculated at the early stage of this outbreak. Majority of infected individuals with no or mild symptoms can release viruses and spread viruses to others, which is extremely challenging for preventing the spread of COVID\u201019. Therefore, intense surveillance is vital for preventing sustained transmission. Active interventions including nutrition supplement, symptomatic treatment, and antiviral treatment are critical for mild patients as well as severe patients. Finally, prophylactic vaccination is highly demanded for future prevention of emerging coronavirus\u2010related epidemics or pandemics.ACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nQingsong Qin was supported from the Department of Education of Guangdong Province of China (No. 2017KTSCX067) and the Natural Scientific Foundation of Guangdong Province of China (No.2018A030307061).CONFLICT OF INTERESTS\nThe authors declare that there are no conflict of interests.AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS\nQQ conceived, wrote, and revised the paper.

World Health Organization has declared this disease to constitute a Public Health Emergency of International Concern on 30 January 2020.3 A total of 26\u2009359 suspected cases and 31\u2009225 confirmed cases with 639 deaths linked to this pathogen on 7 February 2020.4 Different age group are generally susceptible to SARS\u2010CoV\u20102. At present, neonates have been diagnosed with Coronavirus disease (COVID\u201019). Neonatologists should be vigilant assessing newborn babies delivered by infected mather or brought up by infected housemaid and improve the knowledge of prevention and treatment of COVID\u201019.2 ETIOLOGY OF COVID\u201019\nSARS\u2010CoV\u20102 is single\u2010stranded RNA viruses, belongs to subgenus Sarbecovirus of the genus Betacoronavirus.5 SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 particles contain spike and envelope, virions are spherical, oval, or pleomorphic with diameters of approximately 60 to 140\u2009nm. Culture times were 4 days on human airway epithelial cell lines and 6 days on Vero E6/Huh\u20107 cell lines. The single\u2010stranded RNA was 29\u2009903\u2009bp in length. The organization of the SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 genome is 5\u2032\u2010leader\u2010UTR\u2010replicase\u2010S (Spike)\u2010E (Envelope)\u2010M (Membrane)\u2010N (Nucleocapsid)\u20103\u2032\u2010UTR\u2010poly (A) tail with unknown open reading frames.6 Its reference sequence (NC_045512.2) is with an 80.26% sequence identity (and query coverage above 98%) to the human SARS\u2010coronavirus genome (NC_004718.3),7 however, the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MER) coronavirus is lower related to SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 which is a group 2c \u03b2\u2010coronavirus. SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 exhibits very high sequence similarity to the Guangdong pangolin coronaviruses in the receptor\u2010binding domain which indicates pangolins may be an intermediate host of the virus before dissemination to humans.8 SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 has weak resistance, 56\u00b0C for 30\u2009minutes, 75% ethanol, chlorine\u2010containing disinfectant, and peracetic acid can inactivate SARS\u2010CoV\u20102.9 SARS\u2010CoV\u20102\u2010S uses the SARS\u2010coronavirus receptor, angiotensin\u2010converting enzyme 2 (ACE\u20102) for entry host cells. ACE\u20102 is a surface molecule highly expressed in AT2 cells of lung, along with esophageal upper epithelial cells and absorptive enterocytes from ileum and colon which indicated digestive system along with respiratory systems is a potential route for SARS\u2010CoV\u20102.10, 11 The expression level of ACE\u20102 in Asian populations is significantly higher than that in European and American populations, and ACE\u20102 on male cells are higher than on female cells, which can partially explain the incidence rate of novel coronavirus pneumonia are higher in male and Asia.12, 133 TRANSMISSION\nThe symptomatic patients with Coronavirus disease are the main disseminators, but the asymptomatic patients should not be underestimated. The current data show major transmission routes are droplets transmission, contact transmission, and aerosol transmission. fecal\u2010oral transmission cannot be ignored, because the nuclear acid of the SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 is detected in the fecal samples of patients in the United States and China.14 Maternal\u2010infant vertical transmission is doubtful\u2014there have been no documented neonates of intrauterine vertical transmission occurring with SARS and MERS.15, 16 According to existing complete data, amniotic fluid, cord blood, neonatal throat swab, and breastmilk samples from six newborn babies delivered by infected mothers were tested for SARS\u2010CoV\u20102, and all samples tested negative for the virus.174 CLINICAL PRESENTATION OF COVID\u201019\nThe incubation periods of COVID\u201019 were 1 to 14 days, and the mean has been estimated to be 5.2 days (95% confidence interval [CI]: 4.4\u20106.0) and 97.5% of those who develop symptoms will do so within 10.5 days (95% CI: 7.3\u201015.3) of infection.18 From the first confirmed child case who was reported in Shenzhen on 20th January 2020 to 6 February 2020, at least 230 COVID\u201019 cases in children (\u226418 years) have been reported in China. The SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 rapid spread in children suggests that it has a strong transmission capacity in the special population (neonate, children). SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection can range from asymptomatic infection to severe respiratory distress in neonates and children. However, Respiratory distress occurs in children with underlying conditions. One patient had severe malnutrition and survived surgery for congenital heart disease, the other had bilateral hydronephrosis and left\u2010kidney calculi. The clinical course of COVID\u201019 was generally milder in children than adults.The most common clinical symptoms of COVID\u201019 included fever, fatigue, and dry cough. A few patients showed upper respiratory symptoms such as nasal obstruction, nasal discharge, and sore throat. Gastrointestinal symptoms such as abdominal discomfort, vomiting, abdominal pain, and diarrhea may also occur. C\u2010reactive protein was normal or temporary upregulation, ALT levels and myocardial enzyme were not obviously abnormal changes. Chest imaging normalities were present in asymptomatic infected patients. SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 can be mixed to different pathogen including mycoplasma pneumonia, influenza A, influenza B, RSV, and EB virus. The clearance time of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 nucleic acid from nasopharyngeal swab was recorded in three children, 9 days in two patients, 12 days in one patient.19 Thus far, no deaths have been reported in the children which are similar to SARS.19, 20 Three newborns have been diagnosed up to date who mainly belonged to family cluster cases. One 17 days old neonate diagnosed as COVID\u201019 infection had a fever, cough, and vomiting milk. In his family, the housemaid was the earliest case, subsequently, the mother was infected.21 The second newborn appeared fever on 5 days after birth whose mother also confirmed infected. The third one who was born by the infected mother was silent and diagnosed on 30\u2009hours after birth by the viral nucleic acid test. Short breath, vomiting milk, cough, and fever were present in neonates. The vital signs of those neonates were stable, there is no severe emergency case until now.19-235 DIAGNOSIS\nThe diagnosis of COVID\u201019 is based on comprehensive contact and travel history and precise laboratory tests. Current diagnostic tools were the nucleic acid or virus gene tests. Samples included nasopharyngeal swab, sputum, secretion of the lower respiratory tract, blood, and feces. The nasopharyngeal swab is the most common specimens, however, its detection positive rate is less than 50%. Repeated detection is necessary for improving the positive rate. The positive rate of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid was high, but it is not suitable for most of the patients due to increased risk of cross\u2010infection.24, 256 INFECTION CONTROL AND TREATMENT\nNeonatologist must wear protective equipment (including hats, goggles, protective suits, gloves, N95 masks, etc) to resuscitate neonates delivered by confirmed and/or suspected COVID\u201019 puerperant. If the puerperant is positive for SARS\u2010CoV\u20102, the neonate must be isolated, then detected SARS\u2010CoV\u20102.26\nEarly identification and early isolation are imperative for COVID\u201019 control. COVID\u201019 neonates should be placed in negative pressure rooms or in rooms in which room exhaust is filtered through high\u2010efficiency particulate air filters with reference to MERS management.16 No visiting is allowed for neonates of COVID\u201019. Treatment mainly depends on adult patients' clinical experience due to few cases in children. There is no specific drug treatment for SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 being similar to MERS\u2010CoV and SARS\u2010CoV.19, 26 Symptomatic and supportive treatment is the mainstay of therapy for patients of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection including the supply of oxygen, the maintenance of water\u2010electrolyte, and acid\u2010base balance. The supplement of water and electrolyte should be appropriate, so as to avoid aggravating the pulmonary edema and reduced oxygenation.27 For newborns with severe acute respiratory distress syndrome, high\u2010dose pulmonary surfactant, inhaled nitric oxide, high\u2010frequency oscillatory ventilation, and extracorporeal membrane lung may be useful. In the United States, patients' conditions were improved apparently after the treatment with nucleoside analog\u2010remdesivir, but there was just one case, the efficacy needs further verification.18 Interferon\u2010\u03b12b nebulization were be applied in MERS\u2010CoV and SARS\u2010CoV, so it could be considered to use in SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection.29, 30 In addition, three potential drug combinations (sirolimus plus dactinomycin, mercaptopurine plus melatonin, and toremifene plus emodin) are candidate repurposable drugs.31 Moreover, convalescent sera from SARS\u2010CoV\u20102\u2010recovered patients may be useful for SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection, because of a significant reduction in the mortality following convalescent sera from SARS\u2010recovered patients treatment.327 CONCLUSIONS\nCOVID\u201019 can result in asymptomatic to severe illness, fortunately, children without underlying diseases appeared to have mild disease. The disease condition of the neonates was also minor. Though this new virus comes out without specific antiviral drugs treatment, neonatologist needs to more virological, epidemiological, and clinical data to treat and manage COVID\u201019.CONFLICT OF INTERESTS\nThe authors declare that there are no conflict of interests.AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS\nQi Lu and Yuan Shi conceived this review, Qi Lu wrote the manuscript, Yuan Shi revised the manuscript.", "25757": "1 INTRODUCTION\nSince December 2019, there has been an increasing number of unexplained cases of pneumonia in Wuhan, a city of 11 million people in China's Hubei province, which has quickly spread to other cities as well as abroad. The Chinese Health Authorities have carried out very appropriate and prompt response measures: (a) The Chinese government has been dealing with the epidemic in strict accordance with notice no. 1 of the national health commission that pneumonia caused by the new coronavirus shall be included in the management of categories B infectious disease, and the prevention and control measures of groups A infectious disease shall be taken1; (b) The government decided to close down Wuhan, Hubei province, and launched a primary public health emergency response in several provinces and cities across the country. At the same time, the World Health Organization has recently declared the COVID\u201019 as a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC).2 On January 3, 2020, the SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 was identified in samples of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from a patient in Wuhan,3 which is recognized as typical of a lineage B betacoronavirus. It has an envelope, the particles are round or oval, often polymorphic, and the diameter is 60 to 140\u2009nm. Its genetic characteristics are significantly different from SARS\u2010COV and MERS\u2010COV. The current research showed that it had more than 85% homology with bat SARS\u2010like coronavirus (bat\u2010SL\u2010COVZC45). When isolated and cultured in vitro, the SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 can be found in human respiratory epithelial cells in about 96\u2009hours, while it took about 6 days in Vero E6 and Huh\u20107 cell lines,4 and it has been identified as the cause of COVID\u201019. The study found that SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 had the characteristics of human\u2010to\u2010human transmission, and the R0 was estimated at 3.77,5 which was significantly higher than the MERS\u2010COV. According to the official report, the virus may have the characteristics of aerosol transmission, that is, the potential for aerosol transmission in a relatively closed environment exposed to high concentrations of aerosols for a long time.6 The identification and control of suspected COCID\u201019 patients as early as possible were crucial to controlling the further spread of the epidemic by managing the source of infection and cutting off the transmission route. At present, there is however very limited clinical information of the COVID\u201019. Therefore, in our study, the clinical data of nearly 3 months from December 2019 to now were retrieved and collected in a large sample to discover and reveal the clinical symptoms, laboratory test data, and epidemiological characteristics of COVID\u201019 patients, so as to provide help for clinical and epidemic prevention and control of the disease. The data were analyzed by using Microsoft Excel and STATA 15.0 (STATA Corporation, College Station, SE).2 DATA AND METHODS\n2.1 Literature search and selection\nWe conducted a comprehensive systematic literature search of online databases, including PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, WanFang Data, and CNKI, from December 2019 to February 2020 to identify all case studies. The search terms and relative variants were as follows: COVID\u201019; 2019\u2010nCoV; clinical characteristics; discharge rate; fatality rate; meta\u2010analysis. We also reviewed the references of included articles to guarantee the comprehensiveness and accuracy of our research. All the search results were evaluated according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta\u2010Analyses (PRISMA) statement. The inclusion criterions for the 10 articles were as follows: study population: patients with diagnosed COVID\u201019; study design: case studies; outcomes measure: at least one outcome reported among clinical symptoms, laboratory results, discharge data, and death data.\nAbstracts from conferences and commentary articles were excluded.\n2.2 Data extraction and quality assessment\nData extraction and the evaluation of literature quality were conducted independently by two investigators (L.Q.L. and T.H.). Microsoft Excel database was used to record all available information, including baseline details, clinic data, discharge rate, and fatality rate. Any disagreement was resolved by another investigator (Y.Q.W.).\n2.3 Bias risk assessment\nThe MINORS (Table 1)7 was used to assess bias risk.\nTable 1.

The items are scored 0 (not reported), 1 (reported but inadequate), or 2 (reported and adequate). The global ideal score being 16 for noncomparative studies.\n2.4 Statistical analysis of data\nMicrosoft Excel was used to analyze the clinical symptoms and Laboratory results. Single\u2010arm meta\u2010analysis was performed using Stata 15.0 software. Heterogeneity among studies was tested using the Cochran Chi\u2010square test and I2, When I2\u2009<\u200950%, a fixed\u2010effects model was used, while when I2\u2009>\u200950%, a random\u2010effects model was selected. If there was statistical heterogeneity among the results, a further sensitivity analysis was conducted to determine the source of heterogeneity. After the significant clinical heterogeneity was excluded, the randomized effects model was used for meta\u2010analysis. Funnel plot and Egger test were used to detect the publication bias. P\u2009<\u2009.05 was considered as statistically significant (two\u2010sided).3 RESULTS\n3.1 Research selection and quality assessment\nBased on a previous search strategy, 354 studies were searched from the online database. After deleting duplicate records, a total of 231 records were retained. Then, 210 articles were excluded by looking at the titles and abstracts, and 11 of the remaining 21 articles were deleted for various reasons. The last 10 articles were included in the meta\u2010analysis (Figure 1). The characteristics and demographic data of the included studies are shown in Tables 2\u20104.\nFigure 1\nOpen in figure viewerPowerPoint\nA flow diagram of the inclusion criteria of studies eligible for meta\u2010analysis\nTable 2.

By summarizing the clinical data (Tables 3 and 4), we found that the main clinical symptoms of COVID\u201019 patients were fever (88.5%), cough (68.6%), myalgia or fatigue (35.8%), expectoration (28.2%), and dyspnea (21.9%). Minor symptoms include headache or dizziness (12.1%), diarrhea (4.8%), nausea and vomiting (3.9%). The results of the clinical examination showed that the lymphocytopenia (64.5%), increase of C\u2010reactive protein (CRP) (44.3%), increase of lactic dehydrogenase (LDH) (28.3%), and leukocytopenia (29.4%) were more common. The overall performance was consistent with the respiratory virus infection.\n3.3 Sex distribution\nA total of nine studies were included.8-17 The results of the randomized effects model meta\u2010analysis showed that in the sex distribution of this disease men accounted for 60% (95% CI [0.54,0.65]) of COVID\u201019 patients (Figure 2A), which was higher than women. The sensitivity analysis (Supporting Information Materials) showed that there was no study that greatly interfered with the results of this meta\u2010analysis, suggesting that the study was stable. A funnel plot was drawn to test the publication bias (Figure 2B). Publication bias test results: Egger's test (P\u2009=\u2009.312\u2009>\u2009.1) indicated that there was no publication bias.\nFigure 2\nOpen in figure viewerPowerPoint\nForest plot of all the outcomes.

The results of the random effects model meta\u2010analysis showed that the fatality rate of the COVID\u201019 patients was 5% (95% CI [0.01, 0.11]) (Figure 2C). The sensitivity analysis (Supporting Information Materials) showed that Guan et al's study had impact on the results of this meta\u2010analysis. A funnel plot was drawn to test the publication bias (Figure 2D). Publication bias test results: Egger's test (P\u2009=\u20090.133\u2009>\u20090.1) indicated that there was no publication bias.\n3.5 Discharge rate\nA total of six studies were included,9-11, 13-15 with 432 cases. The results of the randomized effects model meta\u2010analysis showed that the discharge rate of the COVID\u201019 patients was 52% (95% CI [0.34,0.70]) (Figure 2E). The sensitivity analysis (Supporting Information Materials) showed that none of the literature had significantly interfered with the results of this meta\u2010analysis. A funnel plot was drawn to test the publication bias (Figure 2F). Publication bias test results: Egger's test (P\u2009=\u2009.104\u2009>\u2009.1) indicated that there was no publication bias.4 DISCUSSION\nThis meta\u2010analysis included the latest studies from December 2019 to March 2019 to analyze the clinical characteristics of the novel coronavirus. Our study, which included 1994 patients, reflects the most recent data since the emergence of novel coronaviruses. Although all the studies were case studies and data of randomized controlled studies were lacking, most of our results had relatively low heterogeneity in terms of single\u2010arm meta\u2010analysis, and the sensitivity analysis also showed that the results were not affected by individual studies and there was no publication bias. Meta\u2010analyses of randomized controlled trials are not necessarily superior to nonrandomized controlled trials in terms of the level of evidence.18\nThe main clinical symptoms of COVID\u201019 patients were fever (88.5%), cough (68.6%), myalgia or fatigue (35.8%), expectoration (28.2%), dyspnea (21.9%). In addition to common respiratory symptoms, the symptoms of headache or dizziness (12.1%) diarrhea (4.8%), nausea, and vomiting (3.9%) were also obvious in some patients. Up to 30% of patients with Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS\u2010COV) also have diarrhea.19 Moreover, MERS\u2010COV was shown to survive in simulated fed gastrointestinal juice and have the ability to infect intestinal organoid models.20 A recent study showed that nCOV was detected in stool samples of patients with abdominal symptoms.21 Therefore, while paying great attention to patients with the respiratory system as the primary symptom, more attention should also be paid to patients with headaches, dizziness, diarrhea, anorexia, nausea, and vomiting. Fecal samples should be tested to exclude a potential alternative route of transmission that is unknown at this stage,10 to minimize false negatives in the diagnosis.\nLaboratory results showed that lymphocytopenia (64.5%), increase of CRP (44.3%), increase of LDH (28.3%), and leukocytopenia (29.4%), were more common. Overall, all of them were consistent with respiratory virus infection. The lymphocytopenia could be used as a reference index in the diagnosis of new coronavirus infections in the clinic. Studies have shown that the levels of inflammatory cytokines may be related to the severity of the disease,10, 16 which is expected to be an indicator of the severity of the disease. The data provided are not comprehensive enough, and the laboratory result values in different studies are not uniform, more studies are needed to confirm whether relevant indicators can provide clinical help.\nThe study suggested that males account for 60% [95%CI (0.54, 0.65)] in the gender distribution of COVID\u201019 patients. And a certain reason for it remains to be further explored. There are some studies that showed MERS\u2010COV and SARS\u2010COV have also been found to infect more males than females.22, 23 The reduced susceptibility of females to viral infections could be attributed to the protection from X chromosome and sex hormones, which play an essential role in innate and adaptive immunity.24 But men should pay more attention to protective measures.\nThe included cases period was 1 January to 7 February, and our study suggested that the discharge rate of patients with COVID\u201019 during this period was 52%, with a fatality rate of 5%. The fatality rate of SARS\u2010COV and MERS\u2010COV is reported to be over 10% and 35%,25, 26 respectively. In comparison, COVID\u201019 has a lower fatality rate. Notably, 31.5% of the dead patients had one or more of the following cases: advanced age (>60 years), cancer, more underlying diseases, or major infections. Guo et al15, 27 found that the fatality rate of patients with viral pneumonia increased when they had a basic disease and mixed bacterial infection, which was consistent with the results of our study.\nOwing to the lack of awareness of the virus in the early stage of this disease, inadequate medical protection, and treatment measures, the high infectivity of the virus led to a dramatic increase in the number of patients, which reflects a lack of medical resources. As a result, the patient discharge rate is relatively low. Recently, it was reported that Remdesivir clinical effect is visible, clinical III trials are ongoing in the domestic, and survivors plasma treatment for heavy, severe cases has shown definite curative effect.6 We should believe that these treatments will significantly reduce the mortality of such patients soon. Limited by the number and quality of included studies, more extensive and large\u2010scale studies are required to identify the clinical features of the disease.ACKNOWLEDGMENT\nThis study was supported by the Gansu Provincial COVID\u201019 Science and Technology Major Project, China, the Key Program of the Natural Science Foundation of Gansu Province, China (18JR3RA366).CONFLICT OF INTERESTS\nThe authors declare that there are no conflict of interests.AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS\nSW\u2010m: methodology; ZH\u2010y: validation; LY: formal analysis; HT\u2010b: investigation; WZ\u2010p: data curation; LL\u2010q, HT, and WY\u2010q: original draft preparation; WY\u2010p: writing review and editing.", "25814": "1 INTRODUCTION\nCOVID\u201019 has been first reported as a cluster of pneumonia cases of unknown etiology from Wuhan, Hubei, Mainland China on 8th December 2019.1 This novel coronavirus outbreak is believed to be originated from an animal source in individuals who visited the local seafood and animal market in Wuhan, after which community transmission led to the initial endemic turning into a pandemic.2, 3 Travel associated cases of COVID\u201019 infection have been reported by different countries.4-6 At present as the world health organization (WHO) has declared the COVID\u201019 as a pandemic, Pakistan is facing a critical situation and strict measures need to be taken to avert the threat of a national health crisis. WHO has expressed its fears that Pakistan is facing a major COVID\u201019 challenge. They mentioned that if effective measurements are not taken Pakistan might emerge as the next epicenter of this pandemic.7-9 It is believed that insufficient consideration is given to the basic infection control protocols including hand washing and personal protective equipment use in the educational and health care institutes of the country. The Ministry of Health, Pakistan has declared new guidelines for infection control which are based on the WHO recommendations.10 However, the implementation of the basic infection control protocols is possible only when people and employees are made aware of the introduced policies by giving them clear guidelines. Awareness level and compliance of the educational and healthcare workers play an important role in the effective and timely prevention and control of a public health crisis.11 To formulate a healthy policy, the multi\u2010disciplinary teams including key front\u2010line workers should be a part of the policy planning to ensure that these policies function effectively.12 Pakistan faces many specific challenges about infection control that must be met by devising national policies.\nOur null hypothesis states that \u201cPakistani masses are not prepared to face a looming threat of a COVID\u201019 epidemic.\u201d The main aim of the present questionnaire\u2010based analysis was to check the awareness level among the employees at educational institutes and the health care workers (HCWs) in various organizations across Pakistan. Questionnaires were filled by diverse groups of faculty, students, HCWs (physicians, nurses and lab staff). These questionnaires addressed access to information, training, confidence in the ability of faculty and HCWs to implement the introduced policies at their workplaces and asses the main threats which could lead to a possible public health crisis. These forms also evaluated the level of preparedness that any institute had to deal with a COVID\u201019 outbreak.2 METHODS\n2.1 Subjects\nA total of 303 individuals were included in this study. These include students and faculty (261) and HCWs (41) of which 32 physicians, 4 nurses and 5 laboratory staff in public and private sector educational and health institutes across Pakistan filled a questionnaire.\n2.2 Questionnaire\nView of students, faculty and HCWs from educational and health institutes regarding the recent public health emergency of the pandemic COVID\u201019 was collected by filling in a standardized questionnaire. Questionnaires were distributed using the quick mode of communications including Facebook, emails, and WhatsApp. Anonymous responses were recorded and no ethical approval was required for this survey. Feedback was taken based on their knowledge about COVID\u201019, its spread, and prevention and control measures implemented at their organizations. The questionnaire contained 21 different questions on basic knowledge of the infection, personal attitudes, and common practices during infection outbreak, control programs and policies, training and orientation conducted to bring awareness on origin, a common mode of transmission, signs, and symptoms. The participants were asked to either choose from given options or write their own opinion. Please access the manuscript at: https://forms.gle/r2SmQa4BEsb3QnJQ6.\n2.3 Statistical analysis\nAll the data were analyzed with computer software SPSS version 21. The \u03c72 test was applied and P value .1 or less was considered significant. Level of significance was measured to evaluate the difference in proportion among different respondent groups (HCW and professionals from educational institutes).3 RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS\n3.1 Characteristics of study group\nIn total 303 individuals including students and faculty (86.42%) and HCWs (13.56%) of which 10.59% physicians, 1.32% nurses and 1.65% laboratory staff in public and private sector educational and health institutes across Pakistan submitted their responses to the questionnaire. Figure 1 summarizes the characteristics of the study groups in terms of age, gender and organization (educational and health care). Out of these respondents, 50.99% were aged less than 25 years, 48.66% between 25 and 50 years, and 0.33% above 50 years comprising of 28.47% males and 71.52% females. A total of 12.58% of the respondents were from government hospitals, 7.61% were from private hospitals and 79.8% were from the educational institutes.\nFigure 1\nOpen in figure viewerPowerPoint\nVisual representation of demographic characteristics of study group.

A P value of .85 suggests that results were insignificant and the variables (profession and awareness regarding the name of the virus were not related). The second question posed was regarding the origin of COVID\u201019, 82.45% of respondents said that they were aware of its origin, while 8.94% said that they did not know its origin, 8.61% of respondents were not sure whether they knew or not the origin of COVID\u201019. The highest uncertainty (50) about the origin of COVID\u201019 was found among the nurses. Based on professional awareness it was seen that 93.75% of physicians, 25% nurses, 100% lab technicians, and 81.61% of staff/students from educational institutions were aware of the origin of COVID\u201019. P value of .022 suggested the significant result that the variable (profession and awareness of the viral origin were related). The third question posed was \u2018are you aware of the signs and symptoms of COVID\u201019\u2032? 91.3% of people said that they knew the signs and symptoms while 4.97% said that they were not aware of them while 3.64% said that maybe they were aware and maybe not. P value .257 suggests that variables (profession and awareness of signs and symptoms are not linked). The fourth query posed was \u201cdoes having flu, fever, and cough means that you are infected.\u201d Response reflected that 10.26% of people said yes, 43.38% said no and 46.36% reported maybe. A P value of .155 suggests that the profession and awareness of COVID\u201019 symptoms are not linked. From our results, it is clear that most people have heard about the name and origin of COVID\u201019 but people who think that they are aware of signs and symptoms are not aware of it. Physicians seemed to be most aware of the signs and symptoms of COVID\u201019 indicating that awareness level is linked to the profession of an individual.\nThere were insignificant variations in response to the query concerning the acquisition of infection from an incoming parcel from china presented in a P value of .285. From the total respondents, 25.17% of people answered yes while 40.4% in no and 34.44% responded maybe. Concerning the acquisition of infection from pets (question 7) insignificant results were obtained (P value .285). A total of 34.44% of people are of the view that they can get it from pets while 40.73% think that it is not possible while 24.83% are uncertain about this query. These results indicate that people in Pakistan are uncertain of the viral acquisition routes and the majority will not follow the standard precautionary measures.\nSignificant data (P value .042) was obtained regarding knowledge about other pandemic viral infections of the past. A total of 70.86% of individuals knew of the past pandemic, 19.21% didn't know of any pandemic of the past while 9.93% were uncertain. Regarding information about how the viral transmission can be stopped in Pakistan, respondents were uncertain, and result obtained was not significant (P value .181). The 73.84% of respondents believed that viral transmission in Pakistan can be prevented, while 3.97% said that it cannot be prevented. In 22.19% respondent's uncertainty was observed. Pakistani people are well aware of the pandemics of the past but many people are uncertain that the looming threat of an upcoming COVID\u201019 epidemic can be averted.\nThe responses to the questions related to the institute specific queries varied in terms of awareness. A P value of .0001 suggested significant results regarding the institutional infection control program query. 29.8% of the respondents were aware of an infection control program at their institute while 52.32% were unaware of any existing infection control program. A total of 17.88% of the respondents were uncertain. The HCWs were more aware of the infection control strategies at their institutes as compared to the academic respondents. Among the HCWs 59.38% of physicians, 75% nurses and 60% lab staff were aware of the existing institutional safety program while in the case of academic staff only 24.9% of respondents answered in affirmation. The query regarding the existence of an emerging infection task force was also significant (0.006). Only 18.87% of respondents were aware of an existing task force. Among HCWs 31.25% physicians, 25% nurses, 60% lab staff and 16.48% academic personnel were aware of an existing task force. The Pakistani masses are not prepared to encounter a potential COVID\u201019 outbreak at their institute as many are unaware of the existence of any emergency response team.\nThe results regarding the infection control policies and guidelines of the country were insignificant (P value .811). A total of 63.91% of respondents said that they were aware of the countries policy concerning COVID\u201019 pandemic while 13.25% were unaware and 22.85% were uncertain. Among HCWs highest uncertainty exist among the lab staff while physicians were least uncertain. When asked about any formal training of infection prevention and control the responses were insignificant (P value .237). Only 57.25% physicians, 50% nurses, 60% lab staff and 35.25% academic individuals had received any formal training of infection control. Almost half of the HCWs who participated in the survey have not undertaken any formal training to deal with a COVID\u201019 case which shows that front\u2010line workers are not prepared.\nRegarding the staff behavior in public health, emergency respondents were uncertain as depicted by P value .287. Only 25.83% of people said that their fellow staff is taking the necessary measures while 40.4% believe that it is not so, however, 33.77% were uncertain. A total of 46.88% of physicians believe that their fellow staff is not prompt, 50% of nurses and 40% of lab staff also believe the same. In the case of academic personnel, only 24.14% believe that their fellows are prompt and taking the necessary precautions. In general, individuals are not cautious enough to protect themselves and people around.\nIt was found from the results that both health care (48.01%) and academic professionals (49.43%) do not believe that their organization is prepared for an infection outbreak. While queries about the cure of the viral infection got positive responses both from HCWs including 62.5% physicians, 100% nurses and 55.56% from academic staff. A least positive response was obtained from lab staff (40%) for this query.\nThe overall response to the query about practicing the social distancing was satisfactory, 71.88% from physicians, 50% nurses, 60% lab staff, and 72.41% academic staff were of the view that going to public and their workplace is not safe.\nFor the query about sources of information regarding COVID\u201019, the internet, and social media remained at the highest level while the newspaper is considered as the third source of information in all professions however most prominent trend was noticed in academic subjects (Figure 2).\nFigure 2\nOpen in figure viewerPowerPoint\nBar chart for distribution of responses according to profession. This figure represents the various sources used by the people to gather knowledge about COVID\u201019. Light blue bar represents friends and family, orange bar stands for internet sources, gray bar represents newspaper and advertisement, the yellow bar represents social media and dark blue bar stands for other sources of information\n3.3 Organization based awareness\nOrganization wise distribution of the responses is shown in Table 2. Results are presented in terms of several respondents and percentages; the P value is also recorded for each response. The overall trend of the queries regarding name, origin and common signs and symptoms of COVID\u201019 lies approximately in a similar range for all types of institutes. However, the least uncertainty was found in the participants of the private hospital. In the question about having cough and fever mean a person is infected, the least response in yes was recorded from the respondents of the private hospital (0/0) however the highest level of uncertainty was recorded for Government hospital subjects (52.63%). Queries about the catching of viral infections from parcels coming from china and pets, most people from all included organizations were of the view that they cannot get an infection from both these sources. Data represented in Table 3 about the previous pandemics, a high level of awareness was found in all organizations. A similar pattern of responses was noticed in a query about the spread of infection in Pakistan. It is clear from the data presented in Table 3 that most people think that viral spared can be stopped in Pakistan. In the same query people from educational institutes also showed their uncertain opinion. Queries about the infection control program in the particular institute, country's infection control policies and guidelines, training for infection, prevention, control and readiness of institutes for the emerging outbreak in the country got responses in No. When asked about the staff's attitude towards the outbreak, mix responses obtained majorly in No and Maybe while little answered in Yes. In the query about the preparation of the organization for the COVID\u201019 outbreak, most people thought that their organization is not ready for a deadly outbreak of viral infection.\nTable 2.

This figure represents the various sources used by the people to gather knowledge about COVID\u201019. Light blue bar represents all organizations, orange bar stands for educational institutes, gray bar represents government institute, the yellow bar represents private institute\n3.4 Gender\u2010wise distribution of responses from HCWs and professionals from educational institutes\nMale and female distribution across different professions was significantly varied (\u2009\u03c72 9.818; P value .001; Table 2). Physicians, nursing and laboratory staff were less likely to be male and female than expected, while the other was significantly more likely to be female and less likely to be male as compared to the expected. According to the profession, the distribution of responses to the questions was varied, so we checked whether gender has any impact on responses. However, both male and female response distribution is very much similar.\n3.5 Age\u2010wise distribution of responses from different profession and organization type\nAccording to the age group we also considered whether there might be a variation in an organization or profession type or question response. Distribution across different professions significantly varied according to different age groups (\u03c72 34.594; P value .001; Table 2). It was observed that higher number of the physician than expected falling in 25 to 50 years\u2019 group that were fewer in below 25\u2010year group, while the opposite is the case with other in which higher number of individual's fallings in both below 25 years and 25 to 50 years\u2019 group (Table 2). Also, concerning the organization, there is a significant variation in the distribution of age groups (\u2009\u03c72 33.036; P value .001). It was mainly observed that in Government and private hospital participants were more likely falling in 25\u2010 to 50\u2010year group that is below 25 years were lesser than expected, whereas educational institute participants were more likely to be falling in below 25 years than expected as compared to the 25\u2010 to 50\u2010year group where the ratio of expected is higher than the observed.\nThe outcome of this questionnaire suggests that Pakistan faces a unique challenge related to public health, which majorly is the people's response towards COVID\u201019 outbreak. Lack of infection prevention and control policies at organizations and hospitals have been observed under the recent challenge. Informative campaigns should be organized through social and digital media to make the citizens aware of this highly contagious infection. In all these cases, staff training, and strict implementation of rules and regulations, effective development of policies and specific guidelines relating to virus spread are required, and all organizations and hospitals need to ensure the proper implementation of the government policies.\nTo make the HCWs well prepared in Pakistan to find this COVID\u201019 pandemic, a series of proper trainings are required. Public awareness programs shall be introduced to make the general public aware of their personal and restrict the community transmission of this virus. Data obtained highlighted the need to initiate capacity building activities towards COVID\u201019 as an obligatory step to establish an effective surveillance system in Pakistan.4 CONCLUSION\nTo avert the threat of an epidemic, it is significant that public knowledge, attitude, and behavior towards COVID\u201019 response is prompt. However, the results of our study reveal that the masses of Pakistan are not aware of the gravity of the situation. Moreover, front\u2010line workers are not prepared to face the challenge. It is a matter of urgency that awareness at all levels is promoted.CONFLICT OF INTERESTS\nThe authors declare that there are no conflict of interests.AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS\nSK and MZ designed the study and compiled the manuscript, MK and KM performed the statistical analysis, NH compiled the statistical results, TH carried out the final formatting and manuscript proofread.

This study was conducted to provide the international community with a deeper understanding of this new infectious disease. Epidemiological, clinical features, laboratory findings, radiological characteristics, treatment, and clinical outcomes of 135 patients in northeast Chongqing were collected and analyzed in this study. A total of 135 hospitalized patients with COVID\u201019 were enrolled. The median age was 47 years (interquartile range, 36\u201055), and there was no significant gender difference (53.3% men). The majority of patients had contact with people from the Wuhan area. Forty\u2010three (31.9%) patients had underlying disease, primarily hypertension (13 [9.6%]), diabetes (12 [8.9%]), cardiovascular disease (7 [5.2%]), and malignancy (4 [3.0%]). Common symptoms included fever (120 [88.9%]), cough (102 [76.5%]), and fatigue (44 [32.5%]). Chest computed tomography scans showed bilateral patchy shadows or ground glass opacity in the lungs of all the patients. All patients received antiviral therapy (135 [100%]) (Kaletra and interferon were both used), antibacterial therapy (59 [43.7%]), and corticosteroids (36 [26.7%]). In addition, many patients received traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) (124 [91.8%]). It is suggested that patients should receive Kaletra early and should be treated by a combination of Western and Chinese medicines. Compared to the mild cases, the severe ones had lower lymphocyte counts and higher plasma levels of Pt, APTT, d\u2010dimer, lactate dehydrogenase, PCT, ALB, C\u2010reactive protein, and aspartate aminotransferase. This study demonstrates the clinic features and therapies of 135 COVID\u201019 patients. Kaletra and TCM played an important role in the treatment of the viral pneumonia. Further studies are required to explore the role of Kaletra and TCM in the treatment of COVID\u201019.1 INTRODUCTION\nAn outbreak of a series of pneumonia cases of unknown cause that began in Wuhan, China has continued since December 2019. This illness is reported to have affected more than 79\u2009602 people so far (74\u2009680 confirmed, 4922 suspected, 16\u2009646 cured, and 2122 deaths). In addition to Hubei, Wanzhou, Chongqing ranks third in infection rates among all of the cities in the provinces of China. A literature review was performed, and it was found that there have been no studies regarding the characteristics of patients infected with COVID\u201019 in Chongqing. Clinically, the disease is characterized by fever, dyspnea, dry cough, and fatigue. Upper\u2010respiratory tract symptoms are not prominent, but diarrhea was reported by some patients. Pulmonary imaging has shown multiple ground glass and infiltrative shadows in both lungs. Severe cases have been shown to develop into acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and septic shock. On 7 January 2019, scientists successfully isolated the pathogen that causes the pneumonia, a new type of \u03b2\u2010coronavirus, and it was named 2019\u2010nCoV.1 Subsequently, WHO named it coronavirus disease (COVID\u201019). An epidemiological survey showed that the first occurrence of COVID\u201019 patients was closely related to a seafood market in south China. Due to the \u201cSpring Festival Movement\u201d (known as the \u201cannual migration of the population in China\u201d), COVID\u201019 rapidly spread throughout the country, and the number of infected people gradually increased. The spread of COVID\u201019 among people has been confirmed to occur through multiple channels, such as droplets, aerosols, feces, and mouth mucus membranes.1\nThe aim of this study is to describe the epidemiological and clinical features, laboratory findings, radiological characteristics, treatment, and outcomes of COVID\u201019 patients in northeast Chongqing. It is hoped that these findings will assist the global community to more clearly understand and treat this new infectious disease.2 METHODS\n2.1 Study design and participants\nThis case series was approved by the Institutional Ethics Board of Chongqing University Three Gorges Hospital (also named Three Gorges Central Hospital, No: 2020\u20102). All of the patients were from northeast Chongqing admitted to the Chongqing University Three Gorges Hospital from 23 January to 8 February 2020 with subsequent confirmed cases of COVID\u201019. A total of 135 patients were enrolled in this study. Oral consent was obtained from all of the patients. The Chongqing University Three Gorges Hospital, located in northeast Chongqing, is a teaching hospital consisting of nine medical colleges and universities, including the Third Military Medical University, the Southwest Medical University, and the North Sichuan Medical College. This facility is responsible for the treatment of COVID\u201019 patients as assigned by the government. All of the patients with COVID\u201019 enrolled in this study were diagnosed according to WHO interim guidance2 and were jointly diagnosed by a multidisciplinary diagnosis and treatment team composed of infectious disease experts, respiratory medicine staff, critical care medical staff, and emergency medicine staff. The clinical outcomes (eg, discharge, mortality, and length of stay) were monitored from 8 February 2020 to the final date of follow\u2010up.\n2.2 Case collection\nClinical data of 135 COVID\u201019 patients were collected from 23 January 2020, when the first case in northeast Chongqing was found, to 8 February 2020. The research team collected the clinical data of patients using the electronic medical record system (HIS). General information included epidemiological histories, current medical histories, symptoms, physical signs, laboratory examination results, chest computed tomography (CT) manifestations, treatment measures, complications, admissions to intensive care unit (ICU), and other parameters. The patients were divided into mild (including normal and mild) and severe (including severe and critical) groups. The mild group had mild clinical symptoms and no pneumonia on imaging. The normal group had symptoms of fever, respiratory tract symptoms, and imaging showed pneumonia. The severe group had respiratory distress, RR\u2009\u2265\u200930\u2009beats/minute in a resting state, a mean oxygen saturation of \u226493%, and an arterial blood oxygen partial pressure (PaO2)/oxygen concentration (FiO2)\u2009\u2264\u2009300\u2009mm\u2009Hg. The critical group had respiratory failure and required mechanical ventilation, the occurrence of shock, and the combined failure of other organs that required ICU monitoring and treatment.3\n2.3 Coronavirus detection\nAll of the suspected cases were detected using real\u2010time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and those who were positive for the coronavirus RNA were identified as confirmed cases. Throat swab samples of the patients were collected, and COVID\u201019 was detected using a Novel Coronavirus 2019\u2010nCoV Nucleic Acid Detection Kit (fluorescent PCR) (Suzhou Tianlong Biotechnology Co Ltd, Jiangsu, China). The throat swab samples, primers, fluorescent probes, reaction buffer, and enzyme mixture were prepared in a reaction system according to a certain procedure, and then amplified according to the following procedures: (a) 50\u00b0C 30\u2009minutes; (b) 95\u00b0C 10\u2009minutes; (c) 94\u00b0C 15\u2009seconds\u2009\u2192\u200950\u00b0C 30\u2009seconds\u2009\u2192\u200972\u00b0C 30\u2009seconds, 5 cycles; (d) 94\u00b0C 10\u2009seconds\u2009\u2192\u200958\u00b0C 30\u2009seconds, 35 cycles.\n2.4 Statistical analysis\nThe categorical variables were described as frequency rates and percentages, and the continuous variables were described using the mean, median, and interquartile range (IQR) values. The continuous variables were compared using independent group t tests when the data were normally distributed; otherwise, the Mann\u2010Whitney test was used. The proportions of categorical variables were compared using a \u03c72 test. All of the statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism 8. For unadjusted comparisons, a two\u2010sided \u03b1 of less than .05 was considered to be statistically significant. The analyses were not adjusted for multiple comparisons, and given the potential for type I error, the findings should be interpreted as exploratory and descriptive.\n2.5 Presenting characteristics\nAmong the 135 hospitalized patients, 40 (29.6%) cases were divided into the severe group and 95 (70.4%) cases were divided into the mild group. The median age of all of the patients was 47 years (IQR, 36\u201055), and 72 (53.3%) cases were male. Compared to mild patients, severe patients were significantly older (median age 56 years [IQR, 52\u201073] vs 44 years [IQR, 33\u201049]; P\u2009<\u2009.001) and were more likely to have underlying comorbidities, such as diabetes (9 [22.5%] vs 3 [3.1%]), cardiovascular disease (6 [15%] vs 1 [1%]), hypertension (4 [10%] vs 9 [9.4%], and malignancy (3 [7.5%] vs 1 [1%]) (Table 1). A majority of 135 patients had a history of exposure in Wuhan (Figure 1).\nTable 1.

Although the coagulation indexes of all of the patients were nearly in the normal range, the Pt, APTT, and d\u2010dimer of the severe patients were higher than those of the mild patients. Compared to the mild patients, the level of albumin was lower in the severe patients (36 [33\u201038.5] vs 49.9 [37.4\u201043.6]; P\u2009<\u2009.0001), and there was no significant difference in the level of alanine aminotransferase and total bilirubin. Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) of severe patients was significantly higher than those of the mild patients (309 [253.8\u2010408.3] vs 212 [179.5\u2010259]; P\u2009<\u2009.0001). Indexes related to myocardial injury, such as creatine kinase, glutamic oxaloacetylase, LDH, and C\u2010reactive protein (CRP), increased more significantly in the severe patients. Procalcitonin was higher in the severe patients than mild patients (0.11 [0.08\u20100.16] vs 0.04 [0.03\u20100.06]; P\u2009<\u2009.0500).\nTable 3.

The marginal areas of the lesions were ill\u2010defined. There was little pleural effusion, and consolidation of the lung occurred when the disease was serious (Figure 2).\nFigure 2\nOpen in figure viewerPowerPoint\nThe character of the chest computed tomography (CT) scan in new coronavirus pneumonia patients.

The CT images were obtained at both lung and mediastinal window settings, showing the multiple patchy ground\u2010glass density shadows on each leaf of the lungs, without bronchial obstruction and pleural effusion\n2.6 Organ dysfunctions and primary interventions\nCommon complications of these 135 patients included ARDS (21 [15.6%]), acute cardiac injury (10 [7.4%]), acute kidney injury (5 [3.7%]), secondary infection (7 [5.1%]), and shock (1 [0.7%]). Severe patients were more likely to have these complications compared to mild patients. All of the patients received antiviral therapy (135 [100%]), and many patients received antibacterial therapy (59 [43.7%]) and corticosteroids (36 [26.7%]). Twenty\u2010seven (67.5%) of the severe patients received noninvasive ventilation. One patient (2.5%) in the severe group was treated with invasive mechanical ventilation. In addition, traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) therapy was applied in most of the patients (124 [91.8%]). As of 8 February 2020, a total of 15 patients (11.1%) had been discharged, and one patient had died. The 28\u2010day mortality rate was 2.5% (Table 4). There was a significant difference between the severe group and the mild group in the number of people that had received antibiotic therapy and corticosteroids (P\u2009<\u2009.0001). There was no significant difference between the two groups in the number of patients who used TCM (P\u2009=\u2009.3220) (Table 4). Actually, most of the patients were treated with a combination of Western and TCM. The application of TCM in viral pneumonia has accumulated rich experience. In recent years, the relevant research has shown that it has a good therapeutic effect on pneumonia.4, 5\nTable 4.

There was no significant difference in the proportion of male and female patients, and infection in children was rare, which was inconsistent with the results of a study performed by Zhong et al.6 Their results showed that males were more likely to be infected than females.6 A total of 83.7% of the patients included in this study had contact history in Wuhan, had been to Wuhan, or had contact with people from Wuhan, which again verified the conclusion of human to human transmission.7 The primary symptoms were fever and cough, which agreed with the research results of Zhao et al.8, 9 Other symptoms included myalgia, fatigue, dyspnea, and anorexia. COVID\u201019 patients rarely developed intestinal signs and symptoms (eg, diarrhea), whereas about 20% to 25% of patients infected with MERS\u2010CoV or SARS\u2010CoV experienced diarrhea.10 The primary complications during hospitalization included ARDS, arrhythmia, and shock. Patchy shadows of the bilateral lungs and ground\u2010glass shadow were typical CT signs of COVID\u201019. The most severe patients were older and had more basic diseases compared to mild patients.\nAccording to the RNA detection results of COVID\u201019 patients in our hospital and the reports of other medical institutions, the sensitivity of the detection kit currently used in clinical is not ideal.1 However, imaging of typical pulmonary changes was seen in a vast majority of the confirmed cases. The imaging of pulmonary changes due to COVID\u201019, like most viral pneumonias, was pleomorphic with interstitial changes and patchy and ground glass shadows.11 The imaging of pulmonary changes was often out of step with the patient's symptoms and nucleic acid test results. The expert group from our hospital called this phenomenon the \u201cshadow\u2010syndrome discrepancy.\u201d Some mild patients often had no fever, cough, dyspnea, and other symptoms. In contrast, the symptoms were mild, and multiple nucleic acid tests were negative, but the CT showed a large ground glass area in the lung. Therefore, some clinicians have suggested that a CT examination should be the first choice in the screening and diagnosis of COVID\u201019, and it has been suggested that patients should have a chest CT scan every 3 to 5 days to understand the changes in the lung lesions to more accurately evaluate the condition.\nCRP and procalcitonin of severe patients were significantly higher than those of mild patients, but bacterial culture results showed no growth after 5 days of aerobic and anaerobic culture, suggesting that although inflammatory factors had increased, there was no significant bacterial infection. The D\u2010dimer concentration was increased in 135 patients, especially in severe patients. This indicated the presence of a hypercoagulable state and secondary hyperfibrinolysis in vivo. In most patients, the leukocyte count was in the normal range and lymphocyte count was generally reduced, which agreed with the recent research results published by academician Zhong et al.6 This suggests that the virus may cause disease by attacking the immune system. LDH and aspartate aminotransferase generally increased, but the albumin of patients decreased. In addition, the changes in the severe patients were more obvious than the mild patients, suggesting that early liver function may be damaged in the mild patients, while liver damage in the severe patients was more obvious.\nAmong the 135 patients, only 1 patient died, and this case will be briefly discussed. He was a 52\u2010year\u2010old male with diabetes and a chronic disease, and his son had recently returned from Wuhan. His neutrophil, d\u2010dimer count, lymphocyte, CD4+T, CD8+T, B cell, and NK cell counts were above normal levels. In addition, his CD4+T/CD8+T counts continued to decline until death (Table 5). He eventually died of acute respiratory distress, oxygen saturation, and heart rate decline, which was consistent with the results of a study performed by Chen et al.12 In addition, Wan et al13 found that CD4+T and CD8+T were lower in severe patients, which suggested that lymphocytes were more inhibited in severe patients. Lymphocytopenia may be related to a cytokine storm caused by viral invasion. This suggests that we should pay more attention to the cellular immunity of patients and take comprehensive measures to treat patients so as to reduce mortality.\nTable 5.

At present, the primary measures to control this disease are early diagnosis, isolation, and supportive treatment for affected patients. In this study, all of the patients were treated with oxygen therapy and antiviral drugs. In addition, many patients received antibacterial therapy (59 [43.7%]) and corticosteroids (36 [26.7%]), and a few patients required invasive ventilation or even extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. According to a recent Korean scholar's report,14, 15 Kaletra was shown to be effective in the early treatment of COVID\u201019 patients, and the earlier Kaletra was used, the more significant the therapeutic effect. Their experience primarily came from the treatment of the MERS coronavirus in 2015, and they had established guidelines. Initially, only the severe patients were treated with Kaletra, and mild patients were not administered the drug in Wuhan, leading to a low patient cure rate. These results indicated that the application effect of Kaletra was not significant in severe patients. All of the patients in our hospital were treated with Kaletra in the early stage, with the belief that Kaletra may play a role in the inhibition of viral replication. Currently, there are 236 patients in our hospital, and 98 of them have been cured and discharged, for a cure rate of 41.5%. The therapeutic effect is obvious. Japan has also announced that they will conduct clinical trials using Kaletra on patients with COVID\u201019.\nIn view of the high amount of cytokines induced by SARS\u2010CoV,16, 17 MERS\u2010CoV,18, 19 and COVID\u201019, 21 (52.5%) of the severe patients were treated with glucocorticoids to reduce inflammatory injury in the lungs. However, due to the limitations of existing evidence, use of glucocorticoids is still controversial. The latest clinical studies20 have suggested that glucocorticoids should not be used to treat lung injury or shock caused by COVID\u201019 without clinical trials. However, some studies2, 21, 22 have shown that the rational use of glucocorticoids could reduce the mortality of SARS patients with critical illness, shorten the length of stay, and not cause secondary infection and other complications. Therefore, glucocorticoids are suggested for treatment according to the \u201cApplication Recommendations of Glucocorticoids for Corona Virus Disease 2019: Recommendations for the use of Glucocorticoids for the New Coronavirus Pneumonia\u201d issued by the Chinese Thoracic Society.23\nSince 2003, TCM has been utilized to fight SARS, H1N1H7N9, MERS, EBOV, and other viral diseases.24 TCM has also been recommended for the treatment of COVID\u201019 in the \u201cNew Coronavirus Pneumonia Diagnosis and Treatment Plan\u201d (trial version 5).3 Chinese patent medicines used in the treatment of COVID\u201019 have primarily included: Reduning injection, Suhuang Zhike capsule, and Xuebijing. In addition, the Chinese herbals used to treat COVID\u201019 primarily include glycyrrhiza, ephedra, bitter almond, gypsum, reed root, amomum, and trichosanthes. TCM primarily functions to clear heat and remove toxicity, to remove heat from the lungs to relieve cough, and to increase immunity.5\nThis study has several limitations. First, the sample size was relatively small compared to Wuhan, where the disease originated, which may have some impact on the statistical results. In general, the number of patients in this area is in the middle level of the rest of the country, except for Wuhan. Therefore, the research results were reliable. Second, most of the 135 patients were still hospitalized at the end of this study. Therefore, it was difficult to evaluate the risk factors for a poor prognosis. Long\u2010term observation is required.\nIn future research, a multicenter study will be established to expand the sample size and to conduct more rigorous randomized controlled trials. In addition, the follow\u2010up of patients who were cured and discharged will be conducted.ACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThis study is supported by the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities Project (No.2020CDJYGRH\u2010YJ03) and the National Social Science Foundation (No. 15BGL191).

The first report of pathological characteristics of the patient who died from severe infection with SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 showed that an increased concentration of highly proinflammatory cytokines.1 Actually, the cytokine storms mediated by overproduction of proinflammatory cytokines have been observed in a large population of critically ill patients infected with COVID\u201019.2, 3 Patients suffered from cytokine storms progress to cardiovascular collapse, multiple organ dysfunction, and death rapidly. Therefore, early identification, treatment, and prevention of the cytokine storms are of crucial importance for the patients.\nIL\u20106 is a cytokine that plays an important role in inflammatory reaction and immune response.4 The most recent clinical experiences in China suggested that IL\u20106 is one of the most important cytokines involved in COVID\u201019\u2010induced cytokine storms. For this reason, TCZ, a humanized monoclonal antibody against the interleukin\u20106 receptor (IL\u20106R), is recommended in seriously ill patients with elevated IL\u20106 by the Diagnosis and Treatment of Pneumonia Infected by Novel Coronavirus issued by the National Health Commission of China in the latest 7th version. However, there are limited real\u2010life data about the effect of TCZ on the inflammatory activity in COVID\u201019 patients.\nIn this retrospective observational study, we aimed to present treatment responses of TCZ in the COVID\u201019 patients and to some extent, provide guidance for clinical use.2 METHODS\n2.1 Study design and participants\nThe patients infected with COVID\u201019, who were treated with TCZ from January 27 to 5 March 2020 at Zhongfaxincheng campus of Tongji Hospital in Wuhan, China, were recruited in this retrospective study. All patients were anonymous. The study was approved by the ethical committee of Huazhong University of Science and Technology.\n2.2 Procedures\nThe data of demographics, comorbidities, treatments, laboratory results, and clinical outcomes of the patients were obtained from the medical records. Based on Diagnosis and Treatment of Pneumonia Infected by Novel Coronavirus issued by the National Health Commission of China, the COVID\u201019 was classified into four types: mildly ill, moderately ill, seriously ill and critically ill.5 The serum levels of CRP and IL\u20106 were observed before and after TCZ administration. CRP, an acute\u2010phase reactant reflecting the inflammatory activity, was defined as elevated when it was higher than 5.0\u2009mg/L.2 The level of IL\u20106 was defined as elevated when it was higher than 7.0\u2009pg/mL.2 The patients whose laboratory data of CRP or IL\u20106 is complete deficiency before or after TCZ administration were considered as study dropouts. The most recent CRP or IL\u20106 values before TCZ administration was selected as the value of before TCZ therapy and the changes of the value after TCZ administration was observed for a week. The clinical outcome of the patients was evaluated within 1 week after TCZ therapy.\n2.3 Statistical analysis\nStatistical analysis was done with SPSS, version 23.0. Data are presented as median (min\u2010max) or as the number and percentage, as appropriate. The Wilcoxon signed\u2010rank test used to compare parameters whenever appropriate. A P\u2010value of less than .05 was considered statistically significant.3 RESULTS\nFifteen patients (12 males and 3 females) with COVID\u201019 were included in this study. The characteristics of patients, the use of TCZ and other anti\u2010inflammatory drugs are summarized in Table 1. The median age (min\u2010max) of the patients was 73 (62\u201080) years. Two (13.3%) patients were moderately ill, six (40.0%) patients were seriously ill, and seven (46.7%) patients were critically ill. Ten (66.7%) patients had one or more co\u2010morbidities, including cadiocerebrovascular diseases and endocrine system diseases. Eight (53.3%) patients received TCZ in combination with MP. Five (33.3%) patients received TCZ administration twice or more. The dose of TCZ used in patients was the range from 80 to 600\u2009mg per time.\nTable 1.

The CRP levels were far above the normal range in all patients before the start of TCZ therapy, and were rapidly ameliorated after the TCZ treatment. The value of CRP at the first time it was detected after TCZ therapy was significantly decreased compared with before TCZ therapy, which dropped from 126.9 (10.7\u2010257.9) to 11.2 (0.02\u2010113.7) mg/L (P\u2009<\u2009.01). Although TCZ has benefits in relieving inflammatory activity, for the four critically ill patients who received only single dose of TCZ therapy, three of them (No. 1, 2, and 3) were still dead and the CRP level in the rest one patient (No. 7) failed to return to normal range (nearly 20 times higher than normal) during the week\u2010long session.

The levels of IL\u20106 before TCZ administration ranged from 16.4 to 627.1\u2009pg/mL (2 times to nearly 90 times higher than normal). After starting TCZ therapy, serum IL\u20106 level in 10 (66.7%) patients tended to spike shortly in first and then decreased. One patient (No. 13) demonstrated a persistent decrease of IL\u20106 after TCZ administration combined with MP. The clinical classification of these patients is mainly moderately ill and seriously ill patients. But in these four critically ill patients who failed the treatment (No. 1, 2, 3, and 7), a persistent and dramatic increase of IL\u20106 was observed. Except for patients No. 1, 2, 3, and 7, patient No. 15 also had a clinical outcome of aggravation.4 DISCUSSION\nIn this study, we evaluated the effect of TCZ therapy in COVID\u201019 patients in real life. Our findings supported the effectiveness of TCZ in the prevention or treatment of cytokine storms induced by COVID\u201019. In most patients, acute phase reactant levels were decreased and the patients were getting to a stable condition reflected by a later gradual decrease of IL\u20106 after TCZ administration.\nCorticosteroids such as MP are the conventional agents used to fight cytokine storms. However, in the treatment of corticosteroids, a high dose and a long\u2010time period were often required and follow with subsequent risk of side effects. In an attempt to provide a corticosteroid\u2010sparing effect, TCZ was recommended in COVID\u201019 patients to prevent or treat cytokine storms. The rationale for the use of the anti\u2010IL\u20106 receptor antibody TCZ in COVID\u201019 patients is based on our understanding of the role of IL\u20106 in this disease and the experience with this drug in the treatment of cytokine release syndrome caused by chimeric antigen receptors redirect T cells.6\nThe present study suggested that a single dose of TCZ seems to fail to improve the disease activity in critically ill patients although it was used in combination with glucocorticoid. However, repeated doses (even repeated with a lower dose) of TCZ might improve the condition of critically ill patients. Therefore, in addition to the safety advantage, a repeated dose of TCZ is more likely to be effective than glucocorticoid in the treatment of COVID\u201019. Moreover, single dose of TCZ might be expected to benefit these seriously ill patients with about 10 times elevated IL\u20106. And the moderately ill patient with an extremely higher level of IL\u20106, almost 90 times of normal, could also benefit from repetitive TCZ therapy. Nevertheless, it seems that repeat the dose at a frequency of daily, every other day, or every 3 days with a totally two to three doses would be sensible in these critically ill patients or patients with an extremely higher level of IL\u20106. Considering the long half\u2010life time of TCZ and the saturate properties of receptor binding, the dose of TCZ could be reduced when repeated use.\nIL\u20106 can be used to evaluate the severity of the infection and predict the prognosis.7 Dynamic observation of IL\u20106 levels is also helpful in understanding the progression of COVID\u201019 and the response to treatment. IL\u20106 level tends to further spiked and then decreased in most patients after starting TCZ therapy. Actually, IL\u20106 is mainly eliminated via IL\u20106R\u2010mediated clearance.8 Binding of TCZ to IL\u20106R inhibits receptor\u2010mediated clearance of IL\u20106, leading to its accumulation in serum. This is the likely explanation for the spiked IL\u20106 levels in TCZ\u2010treated COVID\u201019 patients in this study. And a later gradual decrease of IL\u20106 might partly benefit from the inhibition of inflammatory activity by TCZ that resulting in stabilization or improvement of clinical outcome. Given the application of TCZ combined with PM in patient 13, we propose that PM might account for the persistent decrease of IL\u20106 in this patient since stopping PM administration trend to lead an increase of IL\u20106. It is the other possible risk factors, not an inflammatory activity, which may attribute to the aggravation of the patient No. 15.\nOur result should be evaluated with caution although we reported a good response in patients with TCZ. The number of cases reported is still small and using laboratory parameters to define the disease activity is still challenging. Furthermore, the treatment duration observed in our study may not be sufficient to make a final conclusion. Therefore, observation with a sufficient number of COVID\u201019 patients is still needed to document the effectiveness of TCZ.CONFLICT OF INTERESTS\nThe authors declare that there are no conflict of interests.AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS\nJL and DL were responsible for the design of the study and revised the final manuscript.

The disease and the virus that causes it have been named as COVID\u201019 and SARS\u2010COV\u20102, respectively. In January 2020, the outbreak spread to multiple cities in China, with cases now confirmed in multiple countries.1-3 Human to human transmission is strongly associated with COVID\u20109 and SARS\u2010COV\u20102. Respiratory droplets and human to human contacts are the main routes of transmission of the virus.4 In the early stages of this disease, symptoms of severe acute respiratory infection occur, with some patients rapidly developing acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and other serious complications, which are eventually followed by multiple organ failure.5 Therefore, early diagnosis and timely treatment of critical cases is very crucial. At present, the occurrence, development, mechanism of prognosis and immune status of patients with COVID\u201019 are still unclear. In this study, we have assessed the hematological characteristics of the patients. Also, we have determined the correlation between clinical laboratory data and the severity of COVID\u201019 in adult patients. Moreover, we have determined the predictive value of clinical laboratory data for the severity of COVID\u201019.2 MATERIALS AND METHODS\n2.1 Study subjects\nWe conducted a retrospective study on COVID\u20109 patients from January 23, 2020 to February 2, 2020 in the Fuyang Second People's Hospital. The patients were diagnosed according to the World Health Organization interim guidance for COVID\u201019. The fluorescent reverse transcription\u2010polymerase chain reaction was used to confirm each diagnosis made. Forty\u2010three patients, aged 19 to 70 years (43.74\u2009\u00b1\u200912.12 years), were recruited for the study. They comprised 17 females and 26 males. Blood samples were collected from each participant and then used for hematological investigations. The patients were then put into two groups in terms of the severity of the disease. Hence, there was a mild group (consisting of 28 patients) and the severe group (consisting of 15 patients). Permission to conduct the study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Fuyang Second People's Hospital; and informed written consent was obtained from each patient.\n2.2 Clinical laboratory data\nRoutine blood tests (white blood cell [WBC] count, lymphocyte count [LYM], mononuclear count [MONO], neutrophils count [NEU]) were performed on the blood samples. Blood biochemistry parameters (aspartate aminotransferase [AST], alanine aminotransferase [ALT], glucose [GLU], urea, creatinine [Cr], cystatin [Cys\u2010c], uric acid [UA], and C\u2010reactive protein [CRP]) were measured using HITACHI 7600\u2010020 automated biochemistry analyzer. The reagents used were provided by Shanghai Shenneng\u2010DiaSys Diagnostic Technology Company. Coagulation functions (the d\u2010dimer [d\u2010D], thrombin time [TT], prothrombin time [PT], fibrinogen [FIB], activated partial thromboplastin time [APTT]) were determined using Sysmax CS\u20105100 hemagglutinin analyzer. Procalcitonin (PCT) was detected by Biomerieux Mini VIDAS automatic fluorescence immunoanalyzer. Interleukin\u20106 (IL\u20106) was detected by Roche Cobas E601 on the fully automated electrochemical luminescence immunodetector, using the corresponding reagent. Mild patients used data from their first laboratory test on admission, while severe patients had their most recent laboratory test before their clinical diagnosis. All the operations were done by specially\u2010assigned personnel and in strict accordance with the instructions regarding the use of the reagents.\n2.3 Statistical analysis\nData on AST, urea, Cr, Cys\u2010c, UA, CRP, WBC, LYM, MONO, NEU, TT, FIB, APTT, PT levels were expressed as means\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard deviation (SD). Differences in the levels of these parameters between the mild and severe patients of the disease were determined with the Student t test, as the data were normally distributed. sex was compared using the \u03c72 test, and ages were shown as means\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD. Since the data regarding ALT, GLU, PCT, IL\u20106, and d\u2010D levels were not normally distributed, they were compared between the two groups using Mann\u2010Whitney U tests. The results were presented in terms of the median (interquartile range [IQR]). The area under the curve (AUC) and the 95% confidence interval (CI) of the receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve and logistic regression analysis was computed using the predicted probability of the severe COVID\u201019. The optimal cut\u2010off points to predict the severity of COVID\u201019 were determined by Youden's index. A two\u2010sided P value less than .05 was considered significant. The results of the analysis were obtained using SPSS for windows.3 RESULTS\n3.1 Baseline data\nThe study involved 43 patients. The mean age of the 15 patients (9 males and 6 females) who presented with the severe form of the disease was 45.2 years (SD, 7.68 years). The mean age of the 28 patients (17 males and 11 females) who presented with the mild form of the disease was 42.96 years. P values of gender in the severe group and the mild group were 0.194 and 0.503. There were no significant differences between the severe group and the mild group in gender and age. Baseline characteristics of patients with COVID\u201019 were shown Table 1. The difference between the two groups was significant in diabetes and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.\nTable 1.

The levels of WBC, LYM, MONO, NEU, AST, ALT, UR, CR, Cys\u2010c, UA, APTT, PT, and PCT were not significantly different between the two groups. The level of GLU in the severe group (median: 7.73\u2009mmol/L; IQR: 5.32\u2009mmol/L, 9.91\u2009mmol/L) was significantly higher than in the mild group (median: 6.00\u2009mmol/L; IQR: 5.45\u2009mmol/L, 7.07\u2009mmol/L) (z\u2009=\u2009\u22122.293; P\u2009=\u2009.022). The level of CRP was significantly higher in the severe group (39.37\u2009\u00b1\u200927.68\u2009mg/L) than in the mild group (18.76\u2009\u00b1\u200922.20\u2009mg/L) (t\u2009=\u20092.660; P\u2009=\u2009.011). The level of IL\u20106 was significantly higher in the severe group (median: 36.10\u2009pg/mL; IQR: 23.00\u2009pg/mL, 59.20\u2009pg/mL) than in the mild group (median: 10.60\u2009pg/mL; IQR: 5.13\u2009pg/mL, 24.18\u2009pg/mL) (z\u2009=\u2009\u22123.160; P\u2009=\u2009.002). TT level was significantly higher in the severe group (15.87\u2009\u00b1\u20092.11\u2009seconds) than in the mild group (14.50\u2009\u00b1\u20091.71\u2009seconds) (t\u2009=\u20092.319; P\u2009=\u2009.025). FIB level was significantly higher in the severe group (3.84\u2009\u00b1\u20091.00\u2009g/L) than in the mild group (3.11\u2009\u00b1\u20090.83\u2009g/L) (t\u2009=\u20092.553; P\u2009=\u2009.014). The d\u2010D level was significantly higher in the severe group (median: 0.49\u2009\u00b5g/L; IQR: 0.29\u2009\u00b5g/L, 0.91\u2009\u00b5g/L) than in the mild group (median: 0.21\u2009\u00b5g/L; IQR: 0.19\u2009\u00b5g/L, 0.27\u2009\u00b5g/L) (z\u2009=\u2009\u22122.693; P\u2009=\u2009.007).\nTable 2.

The AUC of IL\u20106 which was used to predict the severity of COVID\u201019 was 0.795 (P\u2009<\u2009.0001), which could better predict whether COVID\u201019 was complicated by severe pneumonia. The optimum critical point of IL\u20106 in the group was 24.3\u2009pg/mL, which was the upper limit of no severe pneumonia. Similarly, the AUC used by d\u2010D to predict the severity of pneumonia was 0.750 (P\u2009=\u2009.0053). The optimum critical point was 0.28\u2009ng/L, which was the upper limit of no severe pneumonia. When IL\u20106 and d\u2010D were used for combined detection, the AUC for predicting the severity was 0.840 (P\u2009<\u2009.0001), while the AUC of other indicators (GLU, TT, FIB, CRP) were lower than 0.750 indicating that the combined detection increases sensitivity and specificity.

Patients had serious pneumonia and were admitted to the designated hospital in Fuyang, China. All are imported cases. The clinical presentations are very similar to SARS\u2010CoV. Coronaviruses (CoVs), a large family of single\u2010stranded RNA viruses, can infect a wide variety of animals, including humans, causing respiratory, enteric, hepatic, and neurological diseases.6 Human CoV is one of the main pathogens of respiratory infection.5 Most patients have mild symptoms and a good prognosis. So far, a few patients with SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 have developed severe pneumonia, pulmonary edema, ARDS, or multiple organ failure and have died. Patients with severe illness developed ARDS and required ICU admission and oxygen therapy.7 So far, no specific treatment has been recommended for CoV infection except for meticulous supportive care.8 Currently, the source of the infection has not yet been identified. The approach to this disease is the use of personal precautionary measures to reduce the risk of transmission, and early diagnosis of the disease.\nThis study reported the results of blood routine, blood biochemistry, coagulation function, and infection\u2010related biomarkers of the adult patients with COVID\u201019. We found that WBC, LYM, NEU, MONO counts were not significantly different between the severe group and the mild group. However, Huang et al7 found low lymphocytes and WBC counts in most patients. WBC (the severe group 4.26\u2009\u00b1\u20091.64\u2009\u00d7\u2009109/L and the mild group 4.96\u2009\u00b1\u20091.85\u2009\u00d7\u2009109/L) and LYM (the severe group 1.20\u2009\u00b1\u20090.42\u2009\u00d7\u2009109/L and the mild group 1.07\u2009\u00b1\u20090.40\u2009\u00d7\u2009109/L) were close to the bottom line of the normal range in many patients in our study results. This result suggests that SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 might mainly act on lymphocytes, especially T lymphocytes, as does SARS\u2010CoV. Virus particles spread through the respiratory mucosa and infect other cells, induce a cytokine storm in the body, generate a series of immune responses, and cause changes in peripheral WBCs and immune cells such as lymphocytes. Some studies suggest that a substantial decrease in the total number of lymphocytes indicates that CoV consumes many immune cells and inhibits the body's cellular immune function. Damage to T lymphocytes might be an important factor leading to exacerbations of patients.8 The blood biochemistry indices, except for Glu, were not different between the two groups. The median and IQR of Glu in severe COVID\u201019 patients were 7.73 and 4.59\u2009mmol/L in severe patients. Chen et al5 reported the Glu was 7.4 (3.4) mmol/L (median and IQR). It might be because most severe patients have underlying diseases that caused a high Glu level. This study found that coagulation function was significantly different between the severe group (0.49 [0.29, 0.91] \u00b5g/L) and the mild group (0.21 [0.19, 0.27] \u00b5g/L). Wang et al9 found a difference in laboratory findings between patients admitted to the ICU (414 [191, 1324] mg/L) and those not admitted to the ICU (166 [101, 285] mg/L), including higher levels of d\u2010D.9 The results showed that patients with severe conditions would have abnormal coagulation. Coagulation activation could have been related to the sustained inflammatory response. Infection\u2010related biomarkers appeared to differ between the two groups (IL\u20106). However, the proportion of IL\u20106 above normal was (36.10 [23.00, 59.20] pg/mL) in the severe group, which was significantly higher than that in the mild group (10.60 [5.13, 24.18] pg/mL). This was in line with the concept of \u201cCytokine Storm,\u201d which must be experienced by patients with mild illness to become severe, emphasized by Lanjuan Li, an academician of the Chinese Academy of Engineering. Among these risk factors, the ROC curve was used to analyze the specificity and sensitivity of different variables in severe COVID\u201019 patients. The AUC of IL\u20106 and d\u2010D were 0.795 and 0.750, respectively, while those of Glu, TT, CRP, and FIB were below 0.750, thus leading to poor predictive value. When IL\u20106 and d\u2010D were jointly predicted, the ROC curve integral of severe COVID\u201019 was 0.840 (P\u2009<\u2009.01) as good predictors of severe COVID\u201019 under the ROC curve, and the combined detection effect was better. Combined detection was more efficient than independent detection. Logistic regression analysis showed that IL\u20106 and d\u2010D could predict severe COVID\u201019. The combined detection of IL\u20106 and d\u2010D plays a complementary role. The combination of severe COVID\u201019 can be greatly improved by selecting different combinations according to different situations. Early prediction plays an important role. When IL\u20106 was over 24.3\u2009pg/mL and d\u2010D was over 0.28\u2009\u00b5g/L by series test and parallel test, the AUC of the COVID\u201019 with or without the severe was over 0.750, which also confirmed the high prediction efficiency.\nIn conclusion, our findings suggest that IL\u20106 and d\u2010D levels can be used to estimate the severity of COVID\u201019. If necessary, the levels of IL\u20106 and d\u2010D should be measured, as they can help diagnose the severity of adult COVID\u201019 patients.\nThis study has several limitations. Firstly, the sample size was relatively small compared with Wuhan, where the disease originated, which may have some impact on the statistical results. Secondly, due to the large\u2010scale outbreak of the epidemic restricting the flow of people, data on healthy patients are lacking as blank controls. Since this study was a retrospective study, not all patients were continuously monitored for all indicators in the blood including IL\u20106 and d\u2010dimer levels. In future studies, data will be collected from healthy patients as blank controls to further explore the predictive value of IL\u20106 and d\u2010dimer for patients with SARS\u2010COV\u20102 infection.ACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThis study was supported by the National Science and Technology Major Project of the 13th 5\u2010year Plan (Project No:2018ZX10711001\u2010005\u2010002), Natural Science Foundation of Anhui Province (Project No:1708085MH193), and the Basic and Clinical Cooperative Research and Promotion Program of Anhui Medical University (2019xkjT024).

The number of cases was accelerating in China and subsequently all over the world; however, the publications of the COVID\u201019's potential transmission and effectiveness of government interventions were limited. It is urgent to provide more scientific information for a better understanding of the novel coronavirus and further containment of the outbreak.2 INTRODUCTION\nAn unknown virus was suspected to have emerged into the human population in Wuhan in late December 2019 through a report of several pneumonia cases by a local hospital.1 Chinese health authorities took actions immediately and had detected a new virus relevant to the outbreak of disease, which was known as novel coronavirus (nCoV) infected pneumonia by 8 January 20202 and later be designated as COVID\u201019 by WHO.3 The virus was named as the 2019\u2010nCoV temporarily on 12 January 20201 and officially named as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS\u2010CoV\u20102) on 11 February 20203 by WHO.\nCoronaviruses, getting their name from the viruses' vague resemblance to monarchical crowns when imaged using an electron microscope, are a large family of viruses that cause disease in mammals and birds. Coronaviruses can cause illnesses that range from the common cold to much more severe illnesses like SARS, Middle East respiratory syndrome, and COVID\u201019.2\nThe outbreak of COVID\u201019 originated from the four admitted patients with pneumonia who had been working in Wuhan Huanan seafood wholesale market, doing business in live poultry, aquatic products, and some wild animals. The now\u2010closed market being a common factor in infections encouraged the belief that the infection may be linked with certain animals. The species that harbored the SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 was probably bat, containing 96% identical at the whole\u2010genome level.4 The COVID\u201019 may include signs of fever, cough, shortness of breath and general breathing difficulties, organ failures or even death, posing a severe threat to the whole society. The WHO declared the coronavirus outbreak a global health emergency on 30 January 2020.5 The global epidemic seemed to be spreading at an alarming rate, causing 79\u2009824 accumulative laboratory\u2010confirmed infections with 2870 deaths as of 29 February 2020 in China6 and 6009 outside China,7 so it deserved priority attention and intensive research. Chinese health authorities stated that it was likely to transmit from person to person even before any actual signs appeared, which made it especially difficult to prevent and control.8\nHowever, Chinese government have attached extremely great importance and taken a range of prompt public health measures in response to the epidemic, starting by the strict exit screening measures in Wuhan on 23 January and followed by extensive medical support in Wuhan, individual going out under protective equipment (masks), school postponement, cancellation of mass gatherings, spontaneous isolated population, and so on.\nMeanwhile, researchers all around the world have been scrambling to ascertain how the virus spreads and find out the effective ways to put this outbreak quickly under control. Compared to the R0 of H1N1 (1.25)9 and that of SARS (2.2\u20103.6),10 the reproduction number of COVID\u201019 indicates awful potential transmission. The R0 was estimated as 2.2,8 3.8,11 and 2.6812 by different research all round the world. The WHO published an estimated R0 of 1.4 to 2.5.13 R0, the basic reproductive number, is defined as the expected number of additional cases that one case will generate, on average without external intervention. R0 value is usually applied to reflect the potential and severity of infectious diseases. The larger R0 is, the stronger the transmission power will be. If R0 is less than 1, it means that the disease will gradually die out.14 Despite all of the results of the nCoV, the epidemic kept in a constant state of change, especially after the rigorous measures have been taken by Chinese government, so it calls for more comprehensive research such as updated R0 estimates, more appropriate index under the circumstances of intervention such as effective reproductive number (R), methodological improvements, and effect evaluation of control measures to reflect the dynamic and progress of it. In this study, we provided the latest distributions of COVID\u201019 in Wuhan, China, and the whole world. Besides, we adopted the model of susceptible\u2010exposed\u2010infectious\u2010recovered (SEIR) to estimate the dynamics and the potential spread based on the current data of cases, to calculate the R0 and R under different scenarios of the epidemic, and to draw preliminary conclusions about the effectiveness of government measures.3 METHODS\n3.1 Data\nThe data of COVID\u201019 in the study were mainly obtained from National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China, Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, WHO, and various websites of Chinese government agencies, official media, as well as some previous studies as of 29 February 2020.\n3.2 Mathematical model\nOne of the mathematical models in epidemic dynamics, known as the \u201cwarehouse\u201d model, has been widely applied for a long time since it was forwarded by Kermack and McKendrick in 1927. It includes several basic and improved models, such as SIR, SIS, SEIR, and so on, among which SEIR is a typical example that takes the incubation period into account.15 The SEIR, an extensively used epidemic model, can reflect the flows of people between four states: susceptible (S), exposed (E), infectious (I), and recovered (R).\nIn this study, equations for the population change of each warehouse were established as follows15\nwhere , denoted the coefficient of infection rate, denoted the probability of infection per exposure, k denoted the frequency of exposure; , denoted the coefficient of migration rate of latency, denoted the average latency; and , denoted the coefficient of migration rate, denoted the average recovery time.\nThe incidence in the original model was bilinear, because the model assumed that the frequency of exposure U was directly proportional to the total population N in the environment, however the actual exposure frequency of patients was limited, that was to say, if the exposure frequency was a constant K, then\nthe equations were as follows\nand the actual incidence was standard incidence.\nReferring to the design approach of Lipsitch et al,10 this study was modeled in a population (N) of 1\u2009000\u2009000 individuals, consistent with the size of Wuhan city, which was approximately 9\u2009060\u2009000 by the end of 2019. The model simulation was based on the hypotheses: (a) the whole population was susceptible; (b) unprotected contact between the susceptible and the infectious would lead to infection; (c) the susceptible and the infectious were homogenous in the population; (d) the epidemic originated from one single case; (e) no intervention was taken in the early stage of COVID\u201019 epidemic; (f) the patient would be quarantined in the hospital once confirmed; and (g) deterministic dynamic model was employed. In this way, past or future dynamics of disease progression and transmission could be simulated.\n3.3 Sensitivity analysis\nSensitivity analysis is one of the commonly used methods to analyze uncertainty in the assessment. The sensitivity factors which had an important influence on the results were identified one by one from a number of uncertainty factors, and their influence degree and sensitivity degree on the overall results were analyzed and measured. The parameter whose slight variation could lead to a large change in the result was regarded as a sensitivity factor; otherwise, a nonsensitivity factor.16 To explore the various influences of different parameters on the amount of infected people, sensitivity analysis was conducted.\nThe equation of sensitivity coefficient (E) was as follows\nwhere \u0394F denoted the percentage of uncertainty change, where the percentage of different parameters change was selected. \u0394A denoted the percentage of index change, where the percentage of the peak value change of S was selected.\n3.4 Dynamic trend of effective reproductive number (R)\nThe basic reproductive number determines the potential of an epidemic, the extent of transmission in the absence of control measures, and the ability of control measures to decrease spread. In contrast to , the effective reproductive number R measures the number of secondary cases generated by an infectious case once an epidemic is underway. R\u2009=\u2009R0x, where x is the proportion of the population susceptible,10 which can be regarded as a constant if the whole population is susceptible. When control measures are implemented, R may decline due to the depletion of the susceptible or the containment of measures on the epidemic. In this modeling study, we calculated the R0 of COVID\u201019 on the basis of reported cases from 21 January 2020 to 29 February 2020 and drew a trending chart of R.\nThe calculation formula of R017 based on the SEIR model was\nand , ,\nthen\nwhere denoted the generation period, approximate to serial interval; and denoted the ratio of incubation period to generation time.\nWe took the value of each parameter reasonably according to the above formula\nwhere Y(t) was the number of infections with symptoms by time t.\nWe assumed the number of confirmed cases was i, the number of suspected cases was s, and the ratio of suspected cases to confirmed cases was k, then\nwhere the data of confirmed cases and suspected cases were from National Health Commission, the value of k was calculated to be 0.695 (41/59) according to the result of Huang et al18, which showed 41 confirmed cases of the 59 suspected cases. t1 was the date of the first confirmed case of the nCoV infection, which was 8 December 2019.19 In this study, the value of (mean 8.4 days) was assumed to be the same as Lipsitch findings10 and the value for \u03c1 () was derived from the average \u03c1 of the result of Chan et al.20\n3.5 Data fitting\nData fitting is the process of fitting models to data and analyzing the accuracy of the curve,21 which was performed by Python in this study. Parameters were initially set according to the released cases of COVID\u201019, theoretical values of t up to the current date were extracted for curve fitting, and then quadratic fitting was performed based on the actual number of potential diagnoses (Y(t)). A gradient equation was constructed based on the residual sum of squares of the quadratic fitting results to obtain the optimal parameters, which would be helpful in the analysis of the epidemic trend. The coefficient of determination (R2) and fitting bias were adopted to evaluate the goodness of fitting results.4 RESULTS\n4.1 The distribution of confirmed COVID\u201019 cases\nThe geographical distributions of existing confirmed cases as of 29 February 2020 in Hubei Province, China, and worldwide is shown in Figure 1. The epidemic was spreading rapidly, with 27\u2009700 existing confirmed cases in Wuhan city, 33\u2009565 in Hubei province, 35\u2009566 in China, and 40\u2009903 in the whole world (Table S1).\nFigure 1\nOpen in figure viewerPowerPoint\nThe distribution of existing confirmed COVID\u201019 cases in Hubei, China, and worldwide.

The daily number of new recovered cases exceeded new confirmed cases in China for 12 straight days (18\u201029 February 2020), indicating that positive results had been achieved with the rigorous measures, so there was a subsequent downgrading of public health emergency response from the highest level to level 2 or 3 by several provinces (Gansu, Liaoning, Guizhou, Shanxi, Yunnan, Guangdong, etc) from 21 February onwards.24\nFigure 6\nOpen in figure viewerPowerPoint\nDaily number of new recovered cases and new confirmed cases in China\n4.3 Sensitivity analysis\nSensitivity analysis of different parameters was performed to explore the influence degree of different parameters on S value of infected people (Figure 7).\nFigure 7\nOpen in figure viewerPowerPoint\nSensitivity analysis of different parameters\nIt could be learnt from the Figure 7 that the change of Ti value had the greatest impact on I value. The sensitivity coefficient of each parameter was E\u2009\u2212\u2009k\u2009=\u20090.4162, E\u2009\u2212\u2009\u03b20=\u20090.4266, and E\u2009\u2212\u2009Ti\u2009=\u20090.8003. Isolation and quarantine procedures would be less effective as more cases accrue, so the optimization of treatment plan and the development of specific drugs would be of more importance than isolation and protection measures.\n4.4 Dynamic trend of effective reproductive number (R)\nThe R values in Figure 8 were calculated on the basis of case information available from 20 January to 29 February 2020. To show a more intuitive and clear picture of R, Figure 9 was drawn to visualize the trend of R values overtime, which indicated that there was an upward trend of R from 20 January to 30 January, a downward trend from 31 January to 11 February, a short rebound on 12 February and another continuous decline from 13 to 29 February. Time\u2010series analysis was adopted to verify the decline statistically and the result by Dickey\u2010Fuller Test was shown in Figure 10, which proved to be nonstationary data (P\u2009>\u2009.05, and the data were decomposed into time series, as shown in Figure 11, whose result (No. 01 trend of Figure 11) was consistent with that of Figure 9. The feature of high infectiousness for SARS\u2010COV\u20102 led to the upward trend, and No. 3 and No. 4 government measures contributed to the downward trend, the short rebound, and the subsequent decline.\nFigure 8\nOpen in figure viewerPowerPoint\nR values from 20 January to 29 February 2020\nFigure 9\nOpen in figure viewerPowerPoint\nThe trend of R values overtime\nFigure 10\nOpen in figure viewerPowerPoint\nResults of Dickey\u2010Fuller test\nFigure 11\nOpen in figure viewerPowerPoint\nData decomposed into time series\n4.5 Data fitting\nData fitting (Figure 12) was conducted by polyregression using the following fitting equation\nFigure 12\nOpen in figure viewerPowerPoint\nData fitting by polyregression\nThen, the parameters of SEIR were adjusted by means of grid search.

COVID\u201019, coronavirus disease 2019; SEIR, susceptible\u2010exposed\u2010infectious\u2010recovered5 DISCUSSION\nThis study was mainly a data\u2010driven analysis, with the data coming from epidemiological results of published studies (preprint included) and current case information, programed, simulated, and fitted by Python based on the SEIR model. The SEIR differs from the SIR model in the addition of a latency period and can provide a tool for predicting the size and duration of both unconstrained and managed outbreaks\u2014the latter in the context of interventions such as case detection, quarantine, and treatment.26\nR2, the coefficient of determination, is used to measure the fitting degree of the regression line to the observation value and it ranges from 0 to 1. The closer the value of R2 is to 1, the better the fitting degree of the regression line is to the observed value. The SEIR model simulation of COVID\u201019 after data fitting showed the peak existing confirmed cases of 59\u2009769 arriving on 15 February 2020. The conclusion was drawn with a good coefficient of determination (R2), which was very close to 1, and the fitting bias was 3.02% (less than 5%), suggesting high precision of the data\u2010fitting results.\nFaced with the rapidity of the growth of cases, the Chinese Health Authorities have implemented appropriate and prompt response measures, such as retrospective investigations, identifying the characteristics of the pathogen, public health level 1 response, strict exit screening, medical support (infectious disease specialists, public health professionals, physicians, nurses, surgical masks, protective suits, nucleic acid tests, etc), all round environmental sanitation and disinfection, cancellation of mass gatherings especially on the occasion of the Spring festival when it was traditional customs for people to pay new year visits, methodological improvement on the diagnosis, health communication for the public, technical guidance, clinical trial of perspective antiviral medicine like Remdesivir,27 self\u2010protection measures, and spontaneous household quarantine by citizens. With the presence of substantial and rigorous control measures that have been immediately carried out, we simulated the impact of different government control measures on the number of the infected I and the susceptible S by adjusting the frequency of exposure (k). The result showed that decreased frequency of exposure (K) was associated with slower rate of decline in susceptible population and slower rate of increase in infected population, indicating the possible effectiveness of intervention measures.\nThe parameters that could have impact on the model result contained frequency of exposure (k), probability of infection per exposure (), and average recovery time (). Frequency of exposure (k) could be controlled by isolation; infection per exposure () could be adjusted by wearing protective suit and average recovery time () could be shortened by the treatment strategy. To specify the most sensitive factors in intervention, we also conducted sensitivity analysis, proving that the change of had stronger impact on the infected population than quarantine and protective measures, so it was urgent to explore effective treatment options. After the epidemic outbreak, Chinese scientists invested a lot of energy to carry out research to screen out clinical drugs and develop vaccines. The treatment plan at this stage focused on antiviral therapy, antibacterial therapy, glucocorticoid therapy, symptomatic treatment of fever or dyspnea, nutrition support treatment, and so on.28, 30 There was no specific antiviral strategies available, though Remdesivir, a promising drug that has been proved to be effective in fighting against Ebola virus, has been in the step of clinical trial in China.27 Introduction of specific drug would be of great benefit to the containment of the outbreak.\nIt should be noted that estimation of R0 during the pre\u2010epidemic stage could be plagued by data uncertainty and variability,31 so we introduced the effective reproductive number (R), whose equation was R\u2009=\u2009R0x, where x stood for the proportion of the susceptible. Since there was no vaccine at present, we assumed that everyone was susceptible. The number of infected people (including those who have been cured and quarantined) in the total population was very small, so the proportion of susceptible people could be approximately considered as constant. In this way, we established the link between R and R0 according to the reported case data and analyzed the trend by Dickey\u2010Fuller Test, which showed a rise from 20 to 30 January, a decline from 31 January to 11 February, a short rebound on 12 February and another continuous decline from 13 to 29 February. The rise was partly due to the onset after incubation period. The rebound was caused by inducing clinical diagnosis in the fourth phase of government measures. The number of new confirmed cases in Hubei province on 12 February was 148\u200940 (of which 13\u2009332 were clinically diagnosed), which was an extraordinary large increase compared to an average of 2391 cases from 1 to 11 February (Table S2). That accounted for the temporary rebound of R. The government interventions (wearing masks, timely quarantine, improved therapeutic strategy, etc) reduced probability of infection per exposure (), decreased frequency of exposure (), and shortened the average recovery time (), thus contributing to the decline of R. The declines of R could be exploited as strong evidence for the effectiveness of the interventions.\nAccording to the data of China National Health Commission, as of 29 February, the accumulative number of cured cases was more than 41\u2009625 nationwide, and there was a consecutive decrease of confirmed cases for 12 days. Data on 26 February showed that, for the first time, the number of new cases outside China had exceeded that of China. South Korea, Japan, Iran, and Italy were facing a surge increase in number of new confirmed cases.32 Centers for disease control and prevention of United States had confirmed an instance of community spread of COVID\u201019 in California, without any relevant travel history or exposure to another known patient with COVID\u201019.33 Given the potential of pandemic, governments worldwide are scrambling to prevent the spread of the new coronavirus. Under a strict mechanism of massive prevention and control, China has seen a rapid decrease in new cases of coronavirus. The unique measures China has taken may be referential and enlightening to other countries with rapid spread of the virus.\nEvidence from the four\u2010phase stringent measures showed that it was foremost to ensure early detection, early isolation, and early treatment, cutting off the spread from the upstream. This could be achieved by the public health emergency response and interagency mechanism. China's public health emergency response is categorized into four levels, with level I being the highest. Level 1 means the provincial disease control headquarters, in the event of a particularly serious public health emergency, will conduct emergency response work under the decisions and command of the State Council. Initiating public health emergency response and establishing a nationwide interagency mechanism was beneficial for monitoring the implementation of the early detection, early isolation, and early treatment. Another critical factor in enhancing early detection was the improvement of diagnosis method. Nucleic acid tests accounted for a big proportion of the initial pathogenic diagnosis techniques because of the convenience and rapidity, nevertheless, nucleic acid tests had returned false\u2010negative results for people infected with the nCoV, with a 30% to 50% positive rate. Those patients with pneumonia symptoms and virus infection by the lung image but negative result by nucleic acid test were called \"false\u2010negative.\" Caution should be taken against \"false\u2010negative\" because its harm was self\u2010evident. It would not only delay the timely treatment of infected patients, but also cause some patients with less symptoms to circulate in the society because they thought they were not infected so as to increase the probability of other people's infection. Therefore, it was of great importance to introduce the clinical diagnosis in addition to nucleic acid tests in the fourth phase of government measures. The Chinese health authorities issued the fifth version of diagnosis and treatment plan for COVID\u201019.34 According to the updated criteria, suspected cases with imaging characteristics of pneumonia could be clinically diagnosed as COVID\u201019 in Hubei province. In this way, patients could receive standardized treatment as soon as possible, aiming to further improve the success rate of treatment and contain the spread of the epidemic. Second, patients should be admitted to designated hospitals and comprehensive treatment strategy including antiviral therapy, respiratory support, circulatory support, and immunity enhancement should be adopted for those who were critically ill. The initial surge of cases in Wuhan made it difficult for the hospital capacity to meet the demand; therefore, beside the current designated medical institutions, Wuhan learned from Beijing's successful experience during the fight against SARS in 2003 and built two new temporary hospitals\u2014Huoshenshan Hospital and Leishenshan Hospital, which were designed to have a capacity of 1000 beds and 1500 beds, respectively. Third, adequate medical supplies, such as health professionals, masks, protective suits, and coronavirus test kits, should be guaranteed, otherwise insufficient medical resources may resulted in the sharp rise of the COVID\u201019 patients.\nFaced with the massive public health crisis, the authorities and the public are both required to join the fight against the nCoV. Continuous interventions and increased vigilance are needed to prevent the ongoing spread of the nCoV. More domestic and global collaborative efforts are required in the way to fight against the COVID\u201019 to reduce the threat of the outbreak.6 STRENGTH\nThough there were several studies concentrating on the R0 and spread of the epidemic, to the best of our knowledge, there was a little evidence about the dynamic R trend and the effectiveness of government control measures. Also, this study reflected the latest updates about the epidemic up to 29 February 2020. In contrast to a single R0, we attempted to take into account the dynamic changes of R values on different scenarios of the epidemic. This study also established the link between R values and the effect of government measures. Besides, we adopted sensitivity analysis to identify the most effective factor in containing the epidemic. In addition, the estimate of transmission dynamics of the COVID\u201019 was calculated by simulation followed by data fitting, which could be helpful in enhancing the accuracy and precision of the prediction. Finally, given the situation of pandemic potential, the four\u2010phase stringent measures by Chinese government could be referential and enlightening to the other countries suffering from COVID\u201019.7 LIMITATION\nWe were still in the stage of much uncertainty about the COVID\u201019, both in the actual virus host and the possible outbreak scale, so the accuracy and precision of our estimate were subjected to a lot of factors; therefore, it would be beneficial for further studies to offer more valuable and precise information about the novel virus. The actual number of infected patients was not exactly the same as the number of reported cases on that day, and there may be some missing reports and undetected cases. Since the actual number of infected and suspected patients was not observable, there must be some unavoidable discrepancy between the confirmed patients and actual number of infection, which lead to the inevitable deviation of the estimation. Though we adopted the model in the addition of latency, it did not account for the infectiousness during incubation period, so it may reduce the accuracy as a consequence. The travel of people flow between different regions was not well considered, especially the migration after the Spring Festival\u2014back to work and back to school. Sensitivity analysis suggested that effective drug therapy could have great influence on the intervention result, it would have been more comprehensive if the study could have included the effect of antiviral treatment. Finally, our research was a data\u2010driven analysis, with data coming from heterogeneous sources, which would definitely introduce inevitable bias, therefore care should be taken in the interpretation of the results.8 CONCLUSION\nBy simulation and data fitting, the model showed the peak existing confirmed cases of 59\u2009769 arriving on 15 February 2020, with sufficient goodness of fit. The optimization of therapeutic strategy and the development of specific drugs would be of more importance than quarantine and protective procedures as more cases accrue. The declines in the dynamic trend of effective reproductive number (R) indicated the effectiveness of four\u2010phase stringent government measures. It is an unprecedented outbreak of coronavirus in the 20th century, which is not exactly the epidemic of a single country, more a public concern of the whole world; therefore, more international cooperation are required to combat the nCoV, focusing on both persistent strict domestic interventions and vigilance against exogenous imported cases.CONFLICT OF INTERESTS\nThe authors declare that there are no conflict of interests.", "25853": "", "25959": "", "25857": "1 INTRODUCTION\nThe outbreak of the infection of 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID\u00ad\u201019) has become a challenging public health threat worldwide.1, 2 The clinical characteristics and mother\u2010to\u2010child vertical transmission potential of COVID\u201019 pneumonia in pregnant women are still unclear.3-5 Answers to these questions are urgent to prevent and control COVID\u201019 pneumonia in children and pregnant women and will help formulate the principles of obstetric treatment for pregnant women with COVID\u201019.6 Here, we report a newborn without severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection born to a convalescing mother with COVID\u201019 pneumonia and assess the mother\u2010to\u2010child intrauterine vertical transmission potential of COVID\u201019. The findings from our case indicated that there was no intrauterine transmission in this woman who developed COVID\u201019 pneumonia in late pregnancy.2 METHODS\nClinical records and laboratory results were retrospectively reviewed for the pregnant woman with COVID\u201019 admitted to Beijing YouAn Hospital, Capital Medical University (Beijing, China), confirmed based on symptoms, chest X\u2010ray and positive real\u2010time reverse transcriptase\u2010polymerase chain reaction (RT\u2010PCR) results. The study was reviewed and approved by the Ethics Committee of Beijing YouAn Hospital, Capital Medical University. Written consent to publish was obtained.\nThe infection status of the mother was accessed by RT\u2010PCR for SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 nucleic acid (RT\u2010PCR Kit; BioGerm, China) of throat swabs and computerized tomography scan (CT). Related samples were collected from the mother at delivery and neonate at birth. RT\u2010PCR tests were conducted on maternal cervical secretion, maternal rectal swab, breast milk, amniotic fluid, neonatal throat swab, and neonatal rectal swab. Maternal and neonatal sera samples were used to test for immunoglobulin G (IgG) and immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibodies (SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 Antibody Detection Kit; INNOVITA, China). Pathological analysis of the placenta was performed (Anti\u20102019\u2010nCoV Nucleoprotein; AbMax, China).3 RESULTS\nOn 29 January, a 25\u2010year\u2010old primiparous woman (33 weeks 1 day of gestation) was hospitalized for suspected SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection and transferred to fever ward for isolation, due to developing a fever of 38\u2103, with dry cough and shivering, 9 days after she arrived at Beijing from Wuhan. The maternal chest X\u2010ray showed thickened lung texture, the lower lobe of the left lung was scattered with spots of patchy shadow. The temperature returned to normal later on the same day. On 30 January, the RT\u2010PCR test of her throat swab was found positive. She was transferred to Beijing YouAn Hospital, Capital Medical University (Beijing, China) and received antiviral, anti\u2010infection, and corticosteroid therapies and recovered following the treatment. On 4 February, she was discharged. Two times follow\u2010up RT\u2010PCR tests were all negative and no abnormality was observed on chest CT.

The birth process was smooth. The newborn's vital signs were stable, without asphyxia or deformity. The Apgar scores of 1, 5, and 10\u2009minutes were 9, 10, and 10 points, respectively. Related specimens were collected immediately from the newborn at birth in the delivery room. The RT\u2010PCR on amniotic fluid, neonatal throat swab, and rectal swab were all negative. Neonatal IgG and IgM antibodies to SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 were both negative (Table 1). Additionally, no inflammation was observed, and N protein of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 detection was negative in the placenta. The newborn and his mother were discharged on 10 March.4 DISCUSSION\nWe report a case that a newborn without SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection was delivered successfully via the vagina. The mother was a convalescing pregnant woman who developed COVID\u201019 pneumonia in the third trimester. The maternal vital signs were stable and the monitoring results of mother and infant were good during the treatment, so the pregnancy continued. Considering she was a convalescing pregnant woman, vaginal delivery was chosen finally.\nSARS\u2010CoV\u20102\u2010specific IgG and IgM were positive in maternal sera, whereas the same test in neonatal sera showed negative. As we know, the detection of IgM antibodies tends to indicate recent exposure to SARS\u2010CoV\u20102, whereas the detection of COVID\u201019 IgG antibodies indicates virus exposure some time ago. Combined with the RT\u2010PCR test results, we believe that the mother had been convalescing from infection and the neonate was absent from SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection. Moreover, the N protein of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 was not observed in the placenta by immunohistochemical analysis. Therefore, we concluded that the newborn was not infected with SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 in the womb. In other words, the results showed that intrauterine vertical transmission was not observed in our case.\nThis study is limited by the single case, and the analysis of additional cases infected in different gestational weeks of pregnancy is necessary to determine if this remains true.ACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThe authors thank the patient and her family for their participation in this investigation.CONFLICT OF INTERESTS\nThe authors declare that there are no confict of interests.AUTHOR CONTRIBUTION\nQC and QP made substantial contributions to the study concept and design.

However, novel coronaviruses (nCoV) that crossover from zoonotic hosts possess unknown sensitivities to treatments and are a principal source of pandemic risk. The clinical effectiveness of treatments from the frontlines of an outbreak can be most informative; however, the options in such an environment are limited by the shallow global pharmacopoeia of general antiviral medicines.1 Opportunities in this environment are further reduced by the limited inventory of antiviral medications produced by manufacturers and the accompanying supply chain optimization challenges that may delay the availability of drugs that show an early signal of efficacy. The emergence of 2019\u2010nCoV (officially named SARS\u2010CoV\u20102) has demonstrated another challenge in the face of emerging nCoV outbreaks, specifically the incomplete evaluation of evidence of drug efficacy from prior nCoV outbreaks.\nIn this review, we critically evaluate the studies that underlie the inconclusive benefit of ribavirin for the treatment of prior nCoV outbreak strains and characterize the primary sources of the controversy. On the one hand, there persist issues of global access and medication affordability, its efficacy in general clinical practice, multimodal mechanisms of direct antiviral activity, and indirect activity of the immune system. On the other hand, there are challenges of conducting controlled clinical studies in an outbreak environment, the limitations of retrospective studies, and the absence of nCoV cases showing acute resolution of infection after treatment as well as in vitro testing data of activity against 2019\u2010nCoV.2 ROLE FOR RIBAVIRIN IN 2019\u2010nCoV TREATMENT\nThe pathology of COVID\u201019 resembles that of the 2013 MERS\u2010CoV and 2003 SARS\u2010CoV infections such that the extrapolation of treatment guidance from those prior clinical experiences can provide guidance for the current outbreak of 2019\u2010nCoV.2 The current \u201crapid advice guidelines for the diagnosis of and treatment of 2019\u2010nCoV\u201d summarize the strong and weak recommendations for treatment on the basis of the current frontline clinical evidence from 170 confirmed cases.3 In this expert perspective of available data, the use of the all\u2010combination antiviral drug is still controversial.3\nAs strain isolates of the 2019\u2010nCoV are distributed for laboratory testing in cell\u2010based and animal model systems, recommendations for treatment may be ascribed. The first 2019\u2010nCoV viral strain submitted for laboratory testing was 2019BetaCoV/Wuhan/WIV04/20192 (WIV04), which was isolated from the lung fluid of one patient in a cohort of seven, six of whom worked in the proximity of the Wuhan seafood market.4 Indeed, the earliest report of in vitro efficacy of five FDA\u2010approved drugs with activity against WIV04 has been reported (ribavirin, penciclovir, nitazoxanide, nafamostat, and chloroquine). In addition, two experimental drugs (remdesivir and favipiravir) have also shown activity against WIV04.5 The report of in vitro direct\u2010acting antiviral activity against the 2019\u2010nCoV establishes the earliest basis for clinical guidance. Treatment with chloroquine and ribavirin may permit some advantage in an outbreak due to immediate drug availability.\nIndeed, as a single agent and due to its cost and availability in China, a chloroquine phosphate multicenter trial was possible, and this drug showed signals of apparent efficacy against 2019\u2010nCoV.6 In contrast, the signals of efficacy from lopinavir/ritonavir were reported from a single case report from the index patient treated in Korea, whose viral titers diminished after treatment.7 Additional laboratory studies may enrich the understanding of synergistic combinations, and subsequent coordinated clinical experience will collectively inform treatment guidance during the 2019\u2010nCoV outbreak. Moreover, from a large number of controlled clinical trials, comparative effectiveness will be better understood, including an investigation to evaluate the merit of the addition of ribavirin to lopinavir/ritonavir treatment in outbreak regions (Table 1).\nTable 1.

Forthcoming laboratory\u2010based test results on new strains and those obtained by using different models may change the order of sensitivity to available treatments for emergent strain variants. The spread of 2019\u2010nCoV globally is a factor that can also influence individual\u2010 and population\u2010level treatment outcomes with different therapies.14 The treatment options developed may lead to observations of efficacious combinations, as seen previously with the addition of ribavirin to combinations of direct antivirals and interferons (IFNs).15, 16 The early inclusion of ribavirin in clinical testing during the outbreak in China and the presence of usage guidelines are a good sign for the evaluability of efficacy in retrospective studies.3 RIBAVIRIN: BASIS OF ANTIVIRAL ACTIVITY\nRibavirin is a guanosine analog that interferes with the replication of RNA and DNA viruses. However, the antiviral activity of ribavirin is not limited to interference with polymerases, that is, the structure of ribavirin also interferes with RNA capping that relies on natural guanosine to prevent RNA degradation. Moreover, to further promote the destabilization of viral RNA, ribavirin inhibits natural guanosine generation by directly inhibiting inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase in a pathway that is vital for the production of the guanine precursor to guanosine.17\nEven when treatment incompletely blocks the virus from replicating, viral nucleic acid replication in the presence of ribavirin occurs with reduced fidelity, leading to the introduction of random mutations that can reduce the viability of the virus.18 This mechanism of action may overcome structure\u2010dependent modes of viral immune evasion in a patient and encourage the generation of protective immunity.\nThe indirect antiviral properties of ribavirin as mediated by the immune system were first observed in the treatment of patients with hepatitis whose symptoms improved without a reduction in the viral load.19 Further study of the immune cells in these patients found that the antiviral Th1 arm of the immune system was boosted by ribavirin, and additional studies have indicated that the enhanced polarization of the immune response may be at the expense of regulatory T cells that suppress the immune response.20-22 This mechanism of immune regulation is one rationale for the testing of ribavirin as an anticancer agent. Ribavirin's multimodal antiviral properties may limit viral replication, reducing the patient's viral load, subsequent pathological tissue damage, and the risk of transmission. There is no knowledge regarding the dosage required to experience each of the unique mechanisms of action of ribavirin, and it is also not known whether the relative threshold for the activity will vary among different patient populations and clinical contexts. A direct viral replicative inhibition is not the exclusive determinant of ribavirin's multimodal antiviral activity. Ribavirin's multiple mechanisms of action likely support its longevity and quality as a clinical resource.\nAs a very mature drug, with significant pharmacological research behind it, the pharmacokinetics and bioavailability data for ribavirin are available to inform dosing both as a single agent and as a part of combination therapies.23 The clinical experience with ribavirin in the pediatric setting for respiratory syncytial virus infection and in the chronic infection setting for hepatitis C offers a wealth of practitioner experience with its safety profile and efficacy.24-26 To achieve efficacy in these two distinct clinical settings, ribavirin is delivered either as an aerosol form or orally. However, concerning the use of CoV, all reports indicate IV or oral dosing.\nThe mean bioavailability of a 400\u2010mg dose of ribavirin is 51.8%\u2009\u00b1\u200921.8% after an IV loading dose of 150\u2009mg. Using a three\u2010compartment model for PK analysis, the mean gamma phase half\u2010life is 37.0\u2009\u00b1\u200914.2\u2009hours. Ribavirin is rapidly absorbed and has a T\u2010max after the oral administration of 1\u2009hour after the first dose, 1.7\u2009hours after the second dose, and 3\u2009hours after the multiple\u2010dose. The route of ribavirin elimination is renal.23, 27 The average peak serum level of ribavirin in human is 24\u2009\u00b5g/mL after a 1000\u2010mg IV dose (Box 1).28\nBox 1. Proposal to decelerate global pandemics\nFor people living in highly populated areas in regions affected by the 2019\u2010nCoV pandemic, there is the creation of a high\u2010risk environment due to the high density of multiple strains of viruses, including 2019\u2010nCoV. Environments that are outside the traditional medical setting require a new approach to treatment and prevention, and they represent a new aspect of nCoV pandemic control: treatment within large\u2010scale and high\u2010density quarantines of infected and noninfected individuals. To prevent either the emergence of new 2019\u2010nCoV strains or the spread of other viruses, the treatment of mild cases in these areas with antiviral therapy is a high priority for local and global health professionals.\nWe propose the usage of ribavirin in this environment for the following reasons:\n1)\nBroad activity toward conventional and novel viruses of DNA and RNA types.\n2)\nMultiple mechanisms of direct antiviral action.\n3)\nRandom mutagenesis of viruses to promote T cell response.\n4)\nIndirect mechanism of action via Th1 polarization.\n5)\nTolerable and well\u2010characterized side effect profile.\n6)\nMature clinical experience and comprehensive demographic characterization.\n7)\nAccessibility.\n8)\nAffordability.\nThe cost for manufacturing ribavirin is US $0.20 to $2.10 per gram.29 An example of over\u2010the\u2010counter retail ribavirin cost in China is as follows: 1800\u2009mg of ribavirin retail price is approximately US $1.00, and it is formulated in 50\u2010mg water\u2010soluble powder packets for oral administration.4 RIBAVIRIN EXPERIENCE IN THE SARS\u2010CoV OUTBREAK\nRibavirin has a well\u2010established history of usage in emergency clinical management plans for nCoV, in which the greatest benefit has been reported with early administration upon presentation with pneumonia and before sepsis or organ system failure.30 This clinical utility has been signaled in small research studies on the treatment of coronaviruses during the SARS\u2010CoV outbreaks in China and North America, and MERS\u2010CoV outbreaks in the Middle East and Asia; however, no definitive clinical study has yet established a therapeutic benefit of ribavirin with 2019\u2010nCoV.\nThe global clinical experience with ribavirin delivery for the treatment of nCoV started with SARS\u2010CoV, for which ribavirin was initially indicated on the basis of the pathological similarity of SARS\u2010CoV to the acute respiratory syndrome, which requires a typical administration of ribavirin and corticosteroid.31, 32 In Hong Kong in 2003, for a reported cohort of 75 patients, the indication for the usage of antiviral therapy was after the exclusion of antibiotic therapy as a part of establishing the diagnosis of SARS. Ribavirin was administered intravenously at 8\u2009mg/kg every 8\u2009hours for 14 days. This treatment was combined in a regimen with intravenous hydrocortisone, then oral prednisolone, and pulses of intravenous methylprednisolone if the condition of patients worsened.31 In a second report from the Hong Kong outbreak, a series of 138 SARS patients were treated with ribavirin secondary to oseltamivir. The ribavirin was delivered orally at 1.2\u2009g, three times per day in combination with prednisolone. Patients with the worsening disease received intravenous ribavirin at a dose of 400\u2009mg every 8\u2009hours in addition to pulsed methylprednisolone.32 The doses of ribavirin used in these reports were associated with a V\u2010shaped curve of viral load, which seemed to exclude the absence of antiviral activity.\nSubsequently, in the Canadian SARS\u2010CoV outbreak, ribavirin was administered early with corticosteroids, and no conclusive results of efficacy could be established, despite viral and symptom flare\u2010up in a portion of patients after treatment cessation.33, 34 The usage of ribavirin in Canada in 2003 was based on the recommended ribavirin tapering treatment for viral hemorrhagic fever, with a loading dose of 2\u2009g, followed by 1\u2009g every 6\u2009hours for the subsequent 4 days and 500\u2009mg every 8\u2009hours for the subsequent 4 to 6 days.27 This dose was significantly greater than that used in Hong Kong for SARS. In a multicenter study in the Toronto area, a series of 144 SARS patients were analyzed, of whom 126 had received this ribavirin dosing regimen schedule and 40% received additional corticosteroids.34\nAlthough the reports of the lower dose ribavirin treatment schedule used in Hong Kong in 2003 did not include descriptions of adverse events, the Canadian experience with higher dosing that year provided a greater insight into the adverse effects of both ribavirin and corticosteroids. Ribavirin usage was associated with hemolysis in 76% of patients, defined as a 1.5\u2010fold increase in bilirubin or a decrease in haptoglobin. In 49% of patients, a 2\u2009g/dL decrease of hemoglobin was observed. In addition, some indication of liver toxicity was indicated on the basis of elevated transaminases, defined as a 1.5\u2010fold increase in aspartate aminotransferase or alanine aminotransferase in 40% of patients. Acute toxicity led to the discontinuation of ribavirin in 18% of patients.34 The prescribing information for ribavirin indicates the expected teratogenic and carcinogenic effects of this drug class on the basis of preclinical animal model testing. The recommendation after the usage of ribavirin in the Canadian SARS outbreak was for contraceptive usage, which was to be advised for 6 months after treatment, equivalent to 15 half\u2010lives of nucleotide accumulation.35\nTo further complicate the evaluation of high\u2010dose ribavirin monotherapy is the possibility that corticosteroids may have delayed viral clearance, prolonging infections while reducing the symptomatic inflammatory cytokines.36-39 Currently, these observations support the contraindication for the usage of corticosteroids for 2019\u2010nCoV.12 Moreover, the first report of outcomes from corticosteroid usage in COVID\u201019 patients shows no benefit.40 The retrospective case reviews from the 2003 SARS\u2010CoV outbreaks have not allowed a robust evaluation of the therapeutic benefit of ribavirin due to the potentially deleterious effects of corticosteroids.\nUpon recognition of the potential efficacy of lopinavir/ritonavir against SARS\u2010nCoV in vitro in 2003, the protease inhibitor lopinavir/ritonavir was combined with ribavirin. A study of 41 SARS\u2010CoV patients showed a favorable clinical response with lopinavir/ritonavir and ribavirin when compared with historical outcomes with ribavirin and corticosteroids.41 That study used the ribavirin dosing schedule for SARS in Hong Kong, which was not associated with treatment discontinuing toxicity. However, the study design included ribavirin in both the treatment and control groups, limiting interpretation of the effect of the nucleoside analog ribavirin.\nChallenges in the evaluation of ribavirin activity in patients during the previous SARS\u2010nCoV and MERS\u2010nCoV outbreaks continue to leave family doctors who reside in areas of outbreak without clear answers regarding the benefit of ribavirin. Although the drug has significant activity against coronaviruses in laboratory testing, the dose required to achieve that activity in patients may not have been known in prior practices without limiting toxicities.5, 41\nThe coronavirus encodes RNA replication proofreading machinery that can partially resist one mechanism of action of nucleoside analogs, placing additional importance on our ability to determine therapeutic doses of ribavirin.42 However, this resistance does not preclude the testing of other nucleoside analogs, such as remdesivir, in cases of 2019\u2010nCoV.43 The knowledge of this mode of nCoV resistance to nucleoside analogs may merit the consideration of testing ribavirin with remdesivir to reduce the emergence of treatment\u2010resistant strains on the basis of mutations in the genes that encode the RNA replication machinery.445 RIBAVIRIN EXPERIENCE IN THE MERS\u2010CoV OUTBREAK\nIn the pursuit of better treatment of MERS\u2010CoV, multiple assay cell lines were used to test for antiviral activity against the strain hCoV\u2010EMC/2012, yielding insights into ribavirin.28 The IC\u201050 dose of ribavirin required to achieve direct antiviral activity toward hCoV\u2010EMC/2012 exceeded the level achievable in humans using the standard assay cell line Vero\u2010RML6, for which direct antiviral activity of ribavirin is now available for 2019\u2010nCoV.4, 45 In this study, the LLC\u2010MK2 cell\u2010based assay was identified as a model host for the evaluation of ribavirin's antiviral properties against hCoV\u2010EMC/2012.45 Comparatively, the standard Vero\u2010RML6 cell\u2010based assay is defective in facilitating the multimodal activity of ribavirin because it is limited in its capacity to convert ribavirin into its mono\u2010 and triphosphate forms. The difference in the potency of single\u2010agent ribavirin between this Vero\u2010RML6 and LLC\u2010MK2 cell\u2010based assays was the difference between unachievable and achievable dose parity in human serum (EC\u201050 41.45\u2009\u00b5g/mL, EC\u201090 92.15\u2009\u00b5g/mL vs EC\u201050 16.33\u2009\u00b5g/mL, EC\u201090 21.15\u2009\u00b5g/mL, respectively). In accordance with the clinical reports from the MERS outbreak, the LLC\u2010MK2 cell\u2010based model showed that the addition of ribavirin to IFN\u2010\u03b12b improved the antiviral effect by 2.16\u2009log against hCoV\u2010EMC/2012.28 With the evaluation of additionally characterized data from in vitro models, insights from multimodal antiviral agents against 2019\u2010nCoV will be informative.\nDuring the outbreak of MERS\u2010CoV, ribavirin was paired with either IFN\u2010\u03b12b or IFN\u2010\u03b12a to engage two independent mechanisms of antiviral activity. This combination was synergistic in laboratory tests, reducing the therapeutic threshold for ribavirin to block viral replication.28 In Saudi Arabia, an interventional study of patients presenting with MERS\u2010CoV, who received oral ribavirin and weekly s.c. 180\u2009\u00b5g IFN\u2010\u03b12a for 2 weeks (n\u2009=\u200920) vs supportive care alone (n\u2009=\u200924), indicated a superior survival and reduced intensive care unit admission rate in the treatment group.16 In that study, the dosage of oral ribavirin was maintained for 8 to 10 days, with adjustments to dosage determined on the basis of creatinine clearance. Three dose groups were administered on the basis of creatinine clearance, specified as group 1: >0.833\u2009mL/sec/m2, group 2: 0.333\u20100.833\u2009mL/sec/m2, and group 3: <0.333\u2009mL/sec/m2 or on dialysis. After receiving an initial 2000\u2010mg loading dose, the 10\u2010day ribavirin schedules for each group were as follows: group 1: 1200\u2009mg every 8\u2009hours for 4 days and then 600\u2009mg every 8\u2009hours for 4 to 6 days; group 2: 600\u2009mg every 8\u2009hours for 4 days and then 200\u2009mg every 6\u2009hours for 4 to 6 days; group 3: 200\u2009mg every 6\u2009hours for 4 days and then 200\u2009mg every 12\u2009hours for 4 to 6 days.16 Using this dosing schedule and in combination with weekly IFN, the ribavirin was well tolerated. Significant adverse events in the treatment group included anemia, which was determined as a twofold mean decrease in hemoglobin (4.32 vs 2.14\u2009g/L). The discontinuation of therapy was not required.\nThis treatment combination for MERS\u2010CoV was deployed for the limited number of cases in Korea.46 However, a retrospective study from the primarily affected region of MERS\u2010CoV reviewed cases treated with ribavirin paired with IFN\u2010\u03b12b, and it was unable to establish a definitive therapeutic benefit, a conclusion that was attributed to the nature of the retrospective and uncontrolled study design.30 To date, the 44\u2010patient, single\u2010institution experience demonstrating the benefit of ribavirin is considered to be the best evidence of a ribavirin treatment combination for coronavirus infection. In a systematic review of treatment options for MERS, the IFN\u2010\u03b2/ribavirin combination therapy was suggested on the basis of a positive risk\u2010benefit profile, whereas ribavirin monotherapy\u2010associated toxicity was noted and thus assumed to not likely provide sufficient benefit to outweigh the toxicity.47 However, the most encouraging evidence for the progressive evolution of treatment is the demonstration of tolerability of lopinavir/ritonavir, ribavirin, and IFN\u2010\u03b12a in a case study of MERS\u2010CoV, suggesting that this combination should be tested as a treatment for 2019\u2010nCoV.48, 496 RIBAVIRIN EXPERIENCE IN THE 2019\u2010nCoV OUTBREAK\nThe government initially recommended the use of ribavirin in 2019\u2010nCoV pneumonia diagnosis in cases of China, based on Treatment Plan Edition 5, such that upon the diagnosis of pneumonia, a 4\u2010g oral loading dose should be delivered, followed by a 1.2\u2010g oral dose every 8\u2009hours.13 This guidance was then modified to 500\u2009mg IV BID or TID in the revised edition 5.11 Although this information may be updated as new evidence becomes available for guidance, previous experience in MERS can assist in understanding the basis of enhancing ribavirin potency toward nCoV as well as extending potential benefits by prescribing low\u2010 and high\u2010treatment options. In the first three published case series of 2019\u2010nCoV treatment (total of 180 cases Wuhan, China; 1 case WA), no patients have reportedly been treated with ribavirin.12, 50, 51 However, the announcement of new clinical studies will offer new evidence of the role of ribavirin in clinical practice for 2019\u2010nCoV8-12 (Table 1).\nAlthough significant effort and resources are contributed to the research and development of nCoV treatments, in times of outbreak, care and preparation are required to apply a scientific approach to quantify the therapeutic benefit of medicines that are already available during such viral outbreaks. On the basis of these prior clinical experiences and others, controlled studies are underway to evaluate the available courses of therapy for COVID\u201019. Among the possible studies that should be completed are drug combinations that use the widely available ribavirin.52 Encouraging signals for the well\u2010documented antiviral ribavirin are the demonstration of in vitro antiviral activity toward the WIV04 strain of 2019\u2010nCoV, its well\u2010established management of side effects, and the potential for lower dosing, based on treatment synergies.5 In the face of this public health emergency, we are mindful of the risk of a deluge of clinical trials that may impact the recruitment and evaluability of prospective research.\nThe public good requires that patients can access life\u2010saving treatments for infectious diseases in an affordable and timely fashion. Access to medical products and establishing their therapeutic benefit are both essential to meet this obligation. Effective clinical treatments prepared from the existing pharmacopoeia can save many lives and achieve the greatest benefit for the public while facing the challenge of 2019\u2010nCoV and future nCoV strains.7 SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION\nThe wide availability and low cost of ribavirin support its potential to significantly impact the treatment of nCoV infections. The challenges in the evaluation of ribavirin efficacy from 2003 during SARS and the 2013 MERS outbreaks led to a summary evaluation of its utility as controversial in the treatment of COVID\u201019 patients. A large number of clinical studies and retrospective analyses that will come from the 2019\u2010nCoV outbreak will put the controversy of ribavirin efficacy in a broader context. For ribavirin and myriad other treatments, both the clinical results and quality of evidence will reveal the challenges that face frontline physicians who treat patients in a medical setting and evaluate prophylaxis for novel high\u2010risk environments formed by large quarantined populations. The critical need for treatment and patient care in outbreak settings, on the frontlines of nCoV outbreaks, will place stress on any medical system and clinical research mechanism. However, controlled clinical studies are underway to permit a prospective evaluation of efficacy, and the government Treatment Plan Edition 5 and revised and prescribed usage guidelines distributed in China will assist in the comparability of multicenter experiences in retrospective analyses. The efforts of clinical research professionals will help both in this outbreak and future outbreaks of nCoV, which will possess unknown sensitivities to our antiviral pharmacopoeia.ACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThe authors would like to thank the medical responders to 2019\u2010nCoV and the global supporters of the patients and populations affected.

This novel CoV has caused a national outbreak of severe pneumonia (coronavirus disease 2019 [COVID\u201019]) in China, and rapidly spreads around the world.\nGenomic analysis shows that SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 is in the same betacoronavirus (\u03b2CoV) clade as MERS\u2010CoV and SARS\u2010CoV, and shares highly homological sequence with SARS\u2010CoV.3 The public evidence shows that COVID\u201019 shares similar pathogenesis with the pneumonia induced by SARS\u2010CoV or MERS\u2010CoV.4 Moreover, the entry of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 into human host cells has been identified to use the same receptor as SARS\u2010CoV.5, 6\nMost CoVs share a similar viral structure and infection pathway,7, 8 and therefore the infection mechanisms previously found for other CoVs may also be applicable for SARS\u2010CoV\u20102. A growing body of evidence shows that neurotropism is one common feature of CoVs.1,9-12 Therefore, it is urgent to make clear whether SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 can gain access to the central nervous system (CNS) and induce neuronal injury leading to the acute respiratory distress.2 THE CLINICAL FEATURES OF SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 INFECTION\nSARS\u2010CoV\u20102 causes acute, highly lethal pneumonia with clinical symptoms similar to those reported for SARS\u2010CoV and MERS\u2010CoV.2, 11 Imaging examination revealed that most patients with fever, dry cough, and dyspnea showed bilateral ground\u2010glass opacities on chest computerized tomography scans.12 However, different from SARS\u2010CoV, SARS\u2010CoV\u20102\u2010infected patients rarely showed prominent upper respiratory tract signs and symptoms, indicating that the target cells of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 may be located in the lower airway.2\nBased upon the first\u2010hand evidence from Wuhan local hospitals,2, 10, 12 the common symptoms of COVID\u201019 were fever (83%\u201099%) and dry cough (59.4%\u201082%) at the onset of illness. However, the most characteristic symptom of patients is respiratory distress (~55%). Among the patients with dyspnea, more than half needed intensive care. About 46% to 65% of the patients in the intensive care worsened in a short period of time and died due to respiratory failure. Among the 36 cases in the intensive care reported by Wang et al,10 11.1% received high\u2010flow oxygen therapy, 41.7% received noninvasive ventilation, and 47.2% received invasive ventilation. These data suggest that most (about 89%) of the patients in need of intensive care could not breathe spontaneously.\nIt is now known that CoVs are not always confined to the respiratory tract and that they may also invade the CNS inducing neurological diseases. Such neuroinvasive propensity of CoVs has been documented almost for all the \u03b2CoVs, including SARS\u2010CoV,1 MERS\u2010CoV,13 HCoV\u2010229E,14 HCoV\u2010OC43,15 mouse hepatitis virus,16 and porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis coronavirus (HEV).9, 17-19\nWith respect to the high similarity between SARS\u2010CoV and SARS\u2010CoV2, it remains to know whether the potential neuroinvasion of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 plays a role in the acute respiratory failure of patients with COVID\u201019.3 THE NEUROINVASIVE POTENTIAL OF SARS\u2010CoV\u20102\nIt is believed that the tissue distributions of host receptors are generally consistent with the tropisms of viruses.20-22 The entry of SARS\u2010CoV into human host cells is mediated mainly by a cellular receptor angiotensin\u2010converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is expressed in human airway epithelia, lung parenchyma, vascular endothelia, kidney cells, and small intestine cells.23-25 Different from SARS\u2010CoV, MERS\u2010CoV enters human host cells mainly via dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), which is present in the lower respiratory tract, kidney, small intestine, liver, and the cells of the immune system.26, 27\nHowever, the presence of ACE2 or DPP4 solely is not sufficient to make host cells susceptible to infection. For example, some ACE2\u2010expressing endothelial cells and human intestinal cell lines failed to be infected by SARS\u2010CoV,28, 29 while some cells without a detectable expression level of ACE2, such as hepatocytes could also be infected by SARS\u2010CoV.20 Likewise, the infection of SARS\u2010CoV or MERS\u2010CoV was also reported in the CNS, where the expression level of ACE230 or DDP430 is very low under normal conditions.\nEarly in 2002 and 2003, studies on the samples from patients with SARS have demonstrated the presence of SARS\u2010CoV particles in the brain, where they were located almost exclusively in the neurons.31-33 Experimental studies using transgenic mice further revealed that either SARS\u2010CoV34 or MERS\u2010COV,13 when given intranasally, could enter the brain, possibly via the olfactory nerves, and thereafter rapidly spread to some specific brain areas including thalamus and brainstem. It is noteworthy that in the mice infected with low inoculum doses of MERS\u2010CoV virus particles were detected only in the brain, but not in the lung, which indicates that the infection in the CNS was more important for the high mortality observed in the infected mice.13 Among the involved brain areas, the brainstem has been demonstrated to be heavily infected by SARS\u2010CoV34, 35 or MERS\u2010CoV.13\nThe exact route by which SARS\u2010CoV or MERS\u2010COV enters the CNS is still not reported. However, hematogenous or lymphatic route seems impossible, especially in the early stage of infection, since almost no virus particle was detected in the nonneuronal cells in the infected brain areas.31-33 On the other hand, increasing evidence shows that CoVs may first invade peripheral nerve terminals, and then gain access to the CNS via a synapse\u2010connected route.9, 17, 19, 36 The trans\u2010synaptic transfer has been well documented for other CoVs, such as HEV679\u201010, 18\u201019 and avian bronchitis virus.36, 37\nHEV 67N is the first CoV found to invade the porcine brain, and it shares more than 91% homology with HCoV\u2010OC43.38, 39 HEV first oronasally infects the nasal mucosa, tonsil, lung, and small intestine in suckling piglets, and then is delivered retrogradely via peripheral nerves to the medullary neurons in charge of peristaltic function of the digestive tract, resulting in the so\u2010called vomiting diseases.18, 19 The transfer of HEV 67N between neurons has been demonstrated by our previous ultrastructural studies to use the clathrin\u2010coating\u2010mediated endocytotic/exocytotic pathway.17\nSimilarly, the trans\u2010synaptic transfer has been reported for avian bronchitis virus.36, 37 Intranasal inoculation in mice with avian influenza virus was reported to cause neural infection besides bronchitis or pneumonia.36 Of interest, viral antigens have been detected in the brainstem, where the infected regions included the nucleus of the solitary tract and nucleus ambiguus. The nucleus of the solitary tract receives sensory information from the mechanoreceptors and chemoreceptors in the lung and respiratory tracts,40-42 while the efferent fibers from the nucleus ambiguus and the nucleus of the solitary tract provide innervation to airway smooth muscle, glands, and blood vessels. Such neuroanatomic interconnections indicate that the death of infected animals or patients may be due to the dysfunction of the cardiorespiratory center in the brainstem.11, 30, 36\nTaken together, the neuroinvasive propensity has been demonstrated as a common feature of CoVs. In light of the high similarity between SARS\u2010CoV and SARS\u2010CoV2, it is quite likely that SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 also possesses a similar potential. Based on an epidemiological survey on COVID\u201019, the median time from the first symptom to dyspnea was 5.0 days, to hospital admission was 7.0 days, and to the intensive care was 8.0 days.10 Therefore, the latency period may be enough for the virus to enter and destroy the medullary neurons. As a matter of fact, the previous studies214, 15 mentioned above has reported that some patients infected with SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 did show neurologic signs such as headache (about 8%), nausea and vomiting (1%). More recently, one study on 214 COVID\u201019 patients by Mao et al.43 further found that about 88% (78/88) among the severe patients displayed neurologic manifestations including acute cerebrovascular diseases and impaired consciousness. Therefore, awareness of the possible neuroinvasion may have a guiding significance for the prevention and treatment of the SARS\u2010CoV\u20102\u2010induced respiratory failure.", "25892": "", "25930": "", "25868": "", "25861": "", "25946": "1 INTRODUCTION\nThe first severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS\u2010CoV\u20102) outbreak was reported in December 2019, and the virus has rapidly spread worldwide within 3 months.1 Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID\u201019) caused by SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 has become pandemic. Most COVID\u201019 patients show mild or moderate symptoms. Severe cases of COVID\u201019 might eventually develop acute respiratory distress syndrome, septic shock, multiple organ failure, bleeding, and coagulation dysfunction2, 3; and is featured by pneumonia, lymphopenia, exhausted lymphocytes, and elevated serum levels of proinflammatory cytokines characterized as a cytokine storm.3, 4 Therefore, the host immune system is thought to have participated in the pathogenesis of COVID\u201019. The importance of innate and adaptive immunity in the defense against SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 needs to be urgently determined.5 To fulfill the pressing need, we examined antibody generation and virus clearance in 26 patients with SARS\u2010CoV\u20102\u2013induced COVID\u201019.2 MATERIALS AND METHODS\nSpecimens from sputum, stool, and nasopharyngeal swabs were collected throughout the illness from 30 January 2020 to 5 April 2020. Viral RNA was extracted from clinical specimens, and real\u2010time reverse\u2010transcription polymerase chain reaction was performed to test the presence of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 using \u201cNovel Coronavirus 2019\u2010nCoV Nucleic Acid Detection Kit\u201d (Shanghai BioGerm Medical Biotechnology Co, Ltd, China).

According to the data collected from patient 2, IgG can be produced at least as early as the 7th day post illness. The average number of days for IgG to be first detected in the four patients was 15; thus, the early production of antibodies does not mean early elimination of this virus. Perhaps the specificity and titer of antibodies are more important. To our knowledge, to date, this is the longest period (36\u201050 days) to observe the coexistence of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 with its specific IgG antibodies in COVID\u201019 patients. How this virus can circulate in the presence of specific IgG antibodies for such a long time is an interesting question. Whether SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 can act like hepatitis C virus that have developed strategies to subvert humoral immunity and persists in the body is worth further investigation.6\nPatient 26, a 5\u2010year\u2010old female, was SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 nucleic acid testing\u2010positive in a stool sample after 46 days of illness but became nucleic acid testing\u2010negative in specimens of sputum, stool, and nasopharyngeal swabs on day 47 post illness (Table 1). No SARS\u2010CoV\u20102\u2013specific IgG and IgM antibodies were detected in the patient's serum until the last sample collection day, which was the 66th day post illness. Although we did not collect data about virus\u2010specific cellular immunity, it is known that cellular immunity is generated concomitantly with humoral immunity, so we could preliminarily exclude the potential role of cellular immunity in SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 elimination in this case. Thus, this is the first report to state that innate immunity plays an essential role in SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 clearance, which highlights the importance of innate immunity in SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 clearance. Moreover, innate immunity alone might be enough to clear the virus. Further studies are required to determine which factors or signaling pathways of innate immunity contribute to this process. A broadly protective and universal vaccine for SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 would take a long time to develop.7, 8 Boosting innate immunity by drugs that mimic viral RNA may contribute to SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 clearance.9 Therefore, vaccine combined with innate immune stimulators may be more effective for fast SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 clearance. We propose that the importance of innate immunity should be investigated further and that the titer and specificity of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102\u2013specific antibodies are important and should be seriously considered in vaccine development. This case may also indicate that some individuals may not generate specific IgG or IgM antibodies after infection with SARS\u2010CoV\u20102; thus, only testing SARS\u2010CoV\u20102\u2013specific antibodies is not a good standard to determine infection, but the combination with the nucleic acid testing method may improve the accuracy of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 detection.\nPatient 25, another 5\u2010year\u2010old female, was found to be IgG\u2010positive on the 10th day post illness, and the patients turned SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 nucleic acid testing\u2010negative on the 23rd day post illness. We also observed that a 9\u2010year\u2010old female patient (patient 12) produced IgG antibodies on the 14th day post illness, and this patient turned SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 nucleic acid testing\u2010negative on the 29th day post illness. These two cases may reveal that children may not show any defects in antibody production and SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 elimination compared with adults.\nThe disease severity and fatality were increased with age in COVID\u201019 patients, which may be explained by the augmentation of proinflammatory responses and the reduction of antiviral cytokines in elder individuals.10 In our study, the younger patients clear SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 faster, thus, whether the antiviral immunity such as type I interferon responses were maximized and proinflammatory responses were minimized in these patients is of great interest; and the molecular mechanism involved in the process would be fundamental to our understanding of the immune system.\nTaken together, we showed that SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 could coexist with virus\u2010specific IgG antibodies in COVID\u201019 patients for an unexpectedly long time and, without adaptive immunity, innate immunity may still be powerful enough to eliminate SARS\u2010CoV\u20102. The long\u2010term coexistence of IgG with SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 in the human body raises the question of whether patients with antibodies are still at risk for reinfection, which may make COVID\u201019 \u201cimmunity passports\u201d unfeasible. Our follow\u2010up studies may answer this question and would, therefore, be beneficial to vaccine development.ACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nWe thank the physicians and nurses in Jinan infectious diseases hospital who cared for these patients and made this study possible.

The risk factors for developing acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and subsequent death in COVID\u201019, have been reported to be age \u226565, neutrophilia, and development of organ failure and coagulation dysfunction.2 Many interventions have been used to prevent the virus from progressing further in the host but in vulnerable patients, it finally progresses towards ARDS and cardiopulmonary arrest.\nIn the present study, we report a patient with COVID\u201019 who after treating with recombinant human erythropoietin (rhEPO) due to his severe anemia, exhibited primarily unexplainable rapid symptoms relief and viral regression.2 CASE PRESENTATION\nAn 80\u2010year\u2010old man with a past medical history of Alzheimer's disease and depression was brought to the emergency department because of a 20\u2010day history of lightheadedness, fainting, progressive weakness, confusion, loss of appetite, fever, cough, and dyspnea.\nThe initial physical examination showed a body temperature of 38.9\u00b0C, blood pressure of 96/60\u2009mm\u2009Hg, pulse rate of 120 beats/minute, respiratory rate of 32 breaths/minute, and oxygen saturation of 80% while the patient was breathing without supplemental oxygen.\nHe also had generalized pallor, bilateral crackles especially in the right lung, no sign of bleeding in digital rectal examination. Other physical exam findings were unremarkable.\nA chest computerized tomography (CT) scan demonstrated peripheral diffuse patchy ground\u2010glass opacities in both lungs.\nAn oropharyngeal swab sample was obtained and referred to the lab for the detection of viral respiratory pathogens by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and was reported positive for SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 within 48\u2009hours.\nlaboratory results on the first day of admission showed: WBC 6.4\u2009K/\u03bcL, Hgb 5.2\u2009g/dL, PLT count 142\u2009000 cell/mm3, MCV 90.6\u2009fL, RDW 34.9%, neutrophil 86.9%, lymphocyte 5.2%, CRP 142.7\u2009mg/L, Urea 46\u2009mg/dL, Cr 1.03\u2009mg/dL, Iron 24\u2009mcg/dL, TIBC 147\u2009mcg/dL, LDH 639\u2009U/L, Retic RPI 1.2%, ferritin 554.86\u2009ng/mL, direct and indirect Coombs negative.\nOne week before his admission, the patient's CBC findings were: WBC 6.2\u2009K/\u03bcL, Hgb 7\u2009g/dL, PLT count 140\u2009000 cell/mm3, MCV 89\u2009fL.\nTransfusion of one unit of packed red blood cell (RBC) and adequate hydration was prescribed for the patient.\nAccording to COVID\u201019 national committee treatment protocols, the following medications were started:\n1)\nHydroxychloroquine Tab 400\u2009mg stat\n2)\nOseltamivir Cap 75\u2009mg twice daily for 5 days\n3)\nLopinavir/Ritonavir Tab 400/100\u2009mg twice daily for 5 days\nrhEPO was administered at a dose of 300\u2009IU/kg divided into 5 doses of 4000 IU subcutaneous injections every other day during a 9\u2010day treatment course.\nFurthermore, Ceftriaxone 1\u2009g twice daily IV infusion was initiated for the treatment of pneumococcal superinfection because of the observed consolidation and air bronchogram pattern in the CT scan (Figure 1).\nFigure 1\nOpen in figure viewerPowerPoint\nSpiral chest CT scan indicating multilobular patchy and ground\u2010glass opacities in favor of COVID\u201019. CT scan, computed tomography scan\nWithin 8 days, both anemia severity and patients\u2019 symptoms attenuated significantly.\nOn discharge day, physical exam revealed a temperature of 37.5\u00b0C, blood pressure of 110/70\u2009mm\u2009Hg, pulse rate of 90 beats/minute, respiratory rate of 20 breaths/minute, and oxygen saturation of 90%.\nLab data results also showed improvements in lymphocyte count which increased from 333 to 933 cell/\u00b5L, and Hgb concentration raised from 5.2 to 6.7\u2009g/dL after one unit of packed RBC transfusion and then up to 9\u2009g/dL after rhEPO administration (Table 1).\nTable 1.

On days 1, 3, 5, and 7, 4000 IU rhEPO was administered subcutaneously. One week after discharge in follow\u2010up, he did not have any of the initial symptoms and the oxygen saturation was 94% in the room air.\nAbbreviation: rhEPO, recombinant human erythropoietin.3 DISCUSSION\nAs mentioned above rhEPO was prescribed for an 80\u2010year\u2010old confirmed case of COVID\u201019 due to his initial severe anemia in addition to antivirals.\nSubsequently, a very fast response considering his age and past medical history both in anemia correction (from Hb:6.7 to Hb:9) and COVID\u201019 symptom relief was observed that could not be elaborated simply as a result of anemia correction.\nThe patient had Iron deficiency anemia and perhaps a mixed component of chronic disease anemia according to the lab results, however a thorough assessment of his anemia was reserved for after his discharge from the hospital.\nErythropoietin (EPO) is a hormone/cytokine produced mainly by the kidneys via hypoxia\u2010inducible factor\u20102 as its primary transcription factor, and through inhibition of RBC precursors\u2019 apoptosis, increases the red cell mass. However, EPO has other beneficial cytoprotective effects including anti\u2010ischemic, regenerative and antiapoptotic effects in a variety of tissues including lung, kidney, cardiac muscle, nervous system, retina, pancreas, and endothelial cells.3 Through a special receptor; EPOR\u2010\u03b2cR, it conducts its protective effects following trauma and in critically ill patients.4\nFew animal studies have been conducted to explain the molecular pathways underlying the nonhematopoietic effects of EPO.\nIn 2019, Zhang et al5 conducted an animal study on rats and grouped them into three groups of Sham, sepsis\u2010caused acute lung injury, and an intervention group with sepsis\u2010caused acute lung injury receiving EPO. The intervention group showed less severe pulmonary interstitial, and alveolar edema, hemorrhage, or lung collapse compared to Sham and sepsis\u2010caused lung injury groups. The protective effects of EPO towards lung tissue were attributed to its effects in inhibiting expression of nuclear factor\u2010\u03baB (NF\u2010\u03baB) in lung tissues, inhibition of interleukin\u20106 (IL\u20106) and tumour necrosis factor alpha as proinflammatory cytokines, and improvement of anti\u2010inflammatory cytokine IL\u201010 levels. A similar study was also conducted to assess rhEPO effect on human respiratory epithelial cell apoptosis and detected cytoprotective effects of rhEPO through induction of an antiapoptotic Bcl\u2010xL/Bax phenotype6 (Figure 2).\nFigure 2\nOpen in figure viewerPowerPoint\nMolecular pathways associated with EPO signaling within the cell. EPO, erythropoietin; EPO\u2010R, erythropoietin receptor\nIn another animal study of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induced sepsis model,7 EPO effect on hepatic mitochondrial damage was assessed and it was shown that EPO suppressed the LPS effect on the increase of IL\u20101\u03b2 and reactive oxygen species levels, mitochondrial DNA copy number, and also decreased protein expressions of caspase\u20101, and NLRP3 (NLR Family Pyrin Domain Containing 3) gene. EPO alleviated LPS\u2010induced cellular edema in hepatic lobules, lymphocytic infiltration, and hepatocellular necrosis.\nRenoprotective effects of EPO in mice with septic acute kidney injury has been observed and has been linked to attenuation of microvascular damage, reducing renal inflammatory response and improvement of renal tissue oxygenation through the decrease of hypoxia\u2010inducible factor\u20101 alpha, inducible nitric oxide synthase, and NF\u2010\u03baB and also enhancement of erythropoietin receptor (EPO\u2010R), PeCAM\u20101, vascular endothelial growth factor, and VEGFR\u20102 expression.8\nAnother study conducted earlier by Heitrich et al9 on a murine model of sepsis\u2010caused acute lung injury and acute kidney injury demonstrated beneficial protective EPO effects on pulmonary and renal outcomes through EPO\u2010R and VEGF/VEGFR\u20102 expression. Moreover, it has been shown that EPO has cardioprotective effects by reducing the myocardial inflammatory response in septic rats and attenuates the reduction in mitochondrial membrane potential and inhibits myocardial cell apoptosis through mitochondrial pathway and by reducing NF\u2010\u03baB p65 expression.10\nNF\u2010\u03baB is a principle factor of multiple inflammatory pathways, and according to the above\u2010mentioned studies, it can be considered an important target for treatment. Blocking the activation of NF\u2010\u03baB by EPO may prevent further deterioration caused by the COVID\u201019 disease through cytokine modulation and its regenerative and antiapoptotic effects\nAnother mechanism for an explanation of EPO effect on the improvement of the clinical condition of the presented case could be rooted to the findings of Ito et al11 on an animal study that revealed that 24\u2009hours after EPO administration, the number of IgDlow immature B cells and mature B cells, as well as CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in the bone marrow, decreased significantly due to their egress into the peripheral blood. This backup leukocyte release into the peripheral bloodstream might be a reason for the optimized viral confrontation of the immune system. Thus in the presented case, after the first dose of rhEPO and packed RBC transfusion, absolute lymphocyte count increased from 333 to 933/\u03bcL of blood; a rise quite larger than to be elucidated only by 250\u2009mL of packed RBCs transfusion.\nDuring inflammation, serum Hepcidin levels increase the following stimulation by IL\u20106, downregulating cellular ferroportin and this leads to decreased iron absorption and its detainment in liver and spleen macrophages12 which could promote the survival of intracellular microorganisms. EPO by downregulating IL\u20106 and Hepcidin levels could lead to an increased release of iron from macrophages and increased absorption of iron by the bone marrow, thus decreasing iron availability for intracellular organisms like Coronavirus for their required enzymatic activities. This antiviral strategy of keeping iron out of infected cells has previously been explored and considered to be potentially effective in human infections by hepatitis C virus, human immunodeficiency virus\u20101, hepatitis B virus, and cytomegalovirus viral infections.13\nAlthough the above\u2010mentioned novel mechanisms of EPO effect in septic states could elaborate the rapid clinical improvement of the presented COVID\u201019 case, we should not underestimate the definitive effects of rising hemoglobin from 6.7 to 9\u2009g/dL in the improvement of pulmonary oxygenation and thus relieving the existing respiratory symptoms. However, the 2.3\u2009g/dL rise in hemoglobin level in only 7 days with the mentioned dose of rhEPO is both profound and questionable considering the reported peak effects of rhEPO in 2 to 6 weeks after the starting dose.14, 15\nIn spite of the aforementioned benefits for EPO, it can aggravate the formation of microthrombosis and subsequent septic multiorgan failure and coagulopathy.16 Besides, in patients with chronic kidney disease\u2010associated anemia, EPO increases thrombotic events and risk of death when administered for Hb more than 12\u2009g/dL.17 Other side effects of rhEPO in patients receiving large doses have been reported to be hypertension, hyperviscosity, enhancement of tumor progression, and in rare instances pure red blood cell aplasia.18\nRegarding the probable benefits of rhEPO in reversing ARDS and its side effects, it seems to be a reasonable choice to use this agent in critically ill COVID\u201019 patients to save their lives from imminent death, however, to determine the optimal dose with maximum cytoprotective and antiapoptotic effects and minimum potential toxicity of rhEPO, more clinical studies are required.\nTherefore, we recommend the designation of well\u2010organized clinical trials with careful consideration of rhEPO administration in anemic COVID\u201019 patients to further evaluate its clinical benefits in this critical patient population group without imposing further adverse effects associated with this drug.CONFLICT OF INTERESTS\nThe authors declare that there are no conflict of interests.", "25804": "We read the published study by Hao Cheng et al1 that organprotective effect of angiotensin\u2010converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and its effect on the prognosis of COVID\u201019. They found SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 invades cells by binding spike proteins (S\u2010proteins) to the ACE2. Therefore, ACE2 may represent a potential breakthrough in the treatment of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection.21 ACE2 STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION\nAngiotensin\u2010converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is a metalloproteinase and a homolog of carboxypeptidase ACE. It hydrolyzes a variety of angiotensin peptides and is the main active peptide of the renin\u2010angiotensin system (RAS).3 ACE2, which is made of 805 amino acids, is a type I transmembrane glycoprotein with a single extracellular catalytic domain. It consists of an extracellular catalytic domain with an N\u2010terminal, a small transmembrane fragment and a short C\u2010terminal intracellular tail. The extracellular region of ACE2 can be cleaved by metalloproteinases, such as ADAM17, resulting in the release from the cell surface of an extracellular region with enzymatic activity. This extracellular region is soluble ACE2 (sACE2).4\nACE2 is expressed in lungs, heart, kidneys, and testes. Studies have found that ACE2 has three main functions.5-7 First, ACE2 is a powerful negative regulator of RAS, balancing the multiple ACE functions. By targeting angiotensin II, ACE2 shows protective effects in the cardiovascular system and many other organs. Second, ACE2 can bind to amino acid transporters and plays an important role in the absorption of amino acids in the kidneys and gut. Third, ACE2 has been identified as the main receptors for SARS\u2010CoV and SARS\u2010CoV\u20102.2 THE ROLE OF SOLUBLE ACE2\nJia et al4 found that sACE2 retains the enzyme activity of ACE2 and can bind to the S\u2010protein of SARS\u2010CoV. So sACE2 can inhibit SARS\u2010CoV infected cells. Since the infection mechanism of SARS\u2010CoV and SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 is basically the same, sACE2 can also inhibit the infection of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 (Figure 1). Additionally, patients with SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection often develop pulmonary edema and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) due to virus\u2010induced ACE2 abscission and reduced ACE2 expression. Therefore, the use of sACE2 has the potential to effectively treat acute lung injury, thereby reducing mortality.8 In addition, sACE2 can potentially be effective in the treatment of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection and the subsequent destruction of other organs with ACE2 receptors, such as the heart, kidney, and testes.\nFigure 1\nOpen in figure viewerPowerPoint\nMechanism of sACE2 in inhibiting SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection. sACE2, soluble angiotensin\u2010converting enzyme 2; SARS\u2010CoV\u20102, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 23 THE ROLE OF CYCLODEXTRIN\nCyclodextrin (CD) is a type of macrocyclic molecule linked by the pyranose unit through the \u03b1\u20101,4\u2010glycoside chain. CDs are capable of enclosing highly hydrophobic molecules (guest molecules) in their hydrophobic cavities (host), forming host\u2010guest complexes. In the pharmaceutical field, the application of CD is mainly aimed at improving the water solubility and dissolution of drugs and developing controlled drug release systems.9 The formation of a complex of CD and sACE2 can effectively improve the water solubility of sACE2 so it meets the requirements for drug atomization inhalation. The inclusion conjugates release sACE2 after entering the body via atomization or other drug delivery means, and the released sACE2 combines with SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 S\u2010proteins to block the virus's ability to infect and destroy human cells.4 DISCUSSION\nViruses have simple structures, lack an independent enzyme system, and mutate easily. The first manifestation of a virus mutation appears as a change in viral traits, including virulence, antigens, resistance to physical and chemical factors, and so on. Mutation ensures the survival and evolution of the virus. Virus mutations seriously affect the therapeutic effects of antiviral drugs and the preventive effect of vaccines.10 The application of sACE2 can potentially prevent the viruses from infecting healthy cells by binding to the S\u2010proteins of the virus and destroying its ability to mutate. All the ACE2\u2010receptor viruses can be blocked by sACE2. So no matter how SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 is mutated, as long as it infects humans by binding the S\u2010proteins to receptors, our drug can work.\nWe can aerosolize sACE2 so that it can be inhaled directly into the lungs, thus preventing inhaled coronavirus from infecting lung cells and stopping replicated coronaviruses released from already\u2010infected lung cells from infecting healthy lung cells. In addition, intravenous infusion of sACE2 can effectively prevent the coronavirus from infecting and damaging other organs that have ACE2 receptors. Eye drops and nasal drops made from CD\u2010sACE2 inclusion compounds can directly block coronavirus infection through the conjunctiva and nasal cavity.\nOn the basis of the above evidence, we believe that CD\u2010sACE2 inclusion compounds can effectively treat COVID\u201019. We hope to begin clinical trials of these drugs as a means of treating patients infected with SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 as soon as possible.ACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThe authors would like to thank TopEdit (www.topeditsci.com) for its linguistic assistance during the preparation of this manuscript.CONFLICT OF INTERESTS\nThe authors declare that there are no conflict of interests.AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS\nJ.X. and P.S. had the idea for and designed the study and had full access to all data in the study and take responsibility for the integrity of the data and the accuracy of the data analysis.

About 80% of laboratory\u2010confirmed cases were mild and moderate cases in adults, including those with or without pneumonia, 13.8% of patients were severe illness, and 6.1% of patients were a critical illness.7 Children infected with SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 were mostly mild cases and few severe cases have been reported.8 Given that children are in a special immune state, we need to be alert to the occurrence of severe cases. In this study, we collected three children cases diagnosed with COVID\u201019 from 3 February to 17 February 2020 in Tianjin. The clinical characteristics of these children were analyzed and reported to provide a reference for the diagnosis and treatment of children during the epidemic of COVID\u201019.2 MATERIALS AND METHODS\n2.1 Study subjects\nChildren diagnosed with COVID\u201019 in Tianjin, China were recruited. The diagnostic criteria for COVID\u201019 refer to the \u201cNew Coronavirus Infected Pneumonia Diagnosis and Treatment Program (Fifth Edition)\u201d9 issued by the National Health and Health Commission.\n2.2 Research method\nBasic information of children who were diagnosed with COVID\u201019: clinical characteristics, laboratory tests, chest imaging, etiological examination, treatment and outcome, and so forth were collected. The throat swab and fecal specimens were sent to Centers for Disease Control in Tianjin, China. The real\u2010time reverse transcriptase\u2010polymerase chain reaction (RT\u2010PCR) nucleic acid tests were used to detect SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 RNA.\n2.3 Discharge criteria\nThis study followed the ethical requirements of biomedical research issued internationally and nationally strictly. All the following criteria9 had to be met for hospital discharge or discontinuation of quarantine: (a) normal temperature lasting longer than 3 days, (b) resolved respiratory symptoms, (c) substantially improved acute exudative lesions on chest computed tomography (CT) images, and (d) two consecutively negative RT\u2010PCR test results separated by at least 1 day.3 RESULTS\n3.1 Clinical characteristics of children with COVID\u201019\nAll the three cases exhibited familial aggregation and experienced a history of close contact with their adult relatives who were diagnosed with COVID\u201019. All of them were male, aged 9, 6, and 8 years, respectively. Throat swab samples were collected on 1 to 14 days after onset of disease and the results of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 nucleic acid tests were positive. All the patients were classified as common type. Cases 1 and 3 had fever, nasal obstruction, runny nose, and digestive tract symptoms. Case 2 had mild clinical manifestations included cough, expectoration, and wheezing. As Case 1 combined with supportive tonsillitis, ceftriaxone anti\u2010infection was used. Case 2 was given ribavirin antivirus treatment. All three cases were given interferon atomization, vitamin C, and oral Chinese medicine treatment. After the treatment, three patients obtained the negative throat swab nucleic acid in 14, 11, and 7 days, and were discharged from hospital with two times of negative results in 16, 13, and 9 days, respectively. Follow\u2010up of isolation point after discharge: no positive result was found in either of the two times of throat swab nucleic acid tests, but the stool SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 nucleic acid tests were positive after 10 days. The three patients were readmitted to the designated hospital. Neither clinical symptoms nor pathological changes in lung imaging were found in any cases. During the monitoring process, three cases appeared SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 negative of stool specimens in 4, 5, and 10 days, respectively (Table 1).\nTable 1.

Case 2 and Case 3 showed a normal range of white blood cells (WBC), CRP, and lymphocyte count. The hemoglobin and platelets were normal in three children. There was no obvious abnormality of troponin, blood gas analysis, electrolyte, liver and kidney function, or myocardial enzyme in three children with COVID\u201019. Serum procalcitonin, blood lactate dehydrogenase, and interleukin\u20106 were normal in three patients. The D\u2010dimer was normal in all three children, but fibrinogen in Cases 2 and 3 was lower than normal. No bacterial growth was observed in the blood culture of three children, and Mycoplasma pneumoniae, chlamydia, respiratory syncytial virus, and adenovirus were negative. Immunological examination (IgG, IgM, IgA, C3, and C4) were all in the normal range, and lymphocyte subsets (T cells, B cells, and NK cells) were basically normal. Urine and stool are normal. No abnormality was found either in electrocardiogram and echocardiography, or in liver, gallbladder, and kidney ultrasound (Table 2).\nTable 2.

A review of CT after the treatment showed that the lesions were absorbed to varying degrees (3\u20105 days).

Lung CT was rechecked 5 days after admission: the GGO of the two lungs was slightly absorbed and faded (Figure 1F).\nCase 3.Admission lung CT: Small piece of GGO under the pleura of the posterior basal segment of the left lower lobe, with uneven density and fuzzy edge (Figure 1G). Reexamination of lung CT 4 days after admission: the range of lesions in the left lower lung was reduced and the density became weak (Figure 1H).4 DISCUSSION\nSince December 2019, there were multiple cases of patients with COVID\u201019 pneumonia found in Wuhan city of Hubei province. As the SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 spreading around the whole world, COVID\u201019 has become a global pandemic disease.10-12 Pediatric case reports were gradually emerging,13, 14 even newborn COVID\u201019 case has been reported.15, 16 Childhood infections were mainly caused by family clustering outbreaks and imported cases,8, 17 daily prevention at home was the main method to prevent viral spreading among children. Three cases of children in this study contacted with close relatives who were diagnosed with COVID\u201019. The three children in this study were classified as a common type of COVID\u201019, with no severe symptom. After infection, children's first symptoms were not typical, as most of them only got fever and cough,6, 8 and some suffer from gastrointestinal symptoms.15 Except for Case 1 with supportive tonsillitis, and obvious fever symptoms, no other serious symptoms were found in all of the three cases. Cases 1 and 3 had mild digestive tract symptoms, while Case 2 and Case 3 showed normal range of CRP, WBC, and lymphocyte count, which consistent with other studies.8, 17 The lung CT showed ground\u2010glass density shadow in two cases, which was typical manifestation of COVID\u201019 pneumonia.18-20 As no specific antiviral drug available for SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection to date, three patients were all treated with interferon nebulization, vitamin C, and Chinese medicine orally and had good results.\nIn the follow\u2010up after discharge, all patients with COVID\u201019 had positive stool RT\u2010PCR test results after 10 days, accompanied by their member of the family. There were no clinical symptoms or imaging discovered in the patients. No positive findings were found by two times of throat swab RT\u2010PCR tests. Considering that children hardly cooperate in taking samples, further study is still necessary to assess whether two negative throat swab tests can be a feasible indicator to judge children's discharge and isolation. It has been reported that SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 nucleic acid was detectable in the stool of adults and anal swabs of children,6, 21 which suggested that live virus exists in the feces discharged by the patients. In our study, we found that the stool nucleic acid was still positive after 10 days of recovery, and compared with anal swab specimens, stool specimens are more representative, suggesting the long existence of viruses in feces and on the surface of objects.\nRecovered patients might be possible carriers for the viruses, which force us to reevaluate the current criteria of hospital discharge or discontinuation of quarantine and continued patient management. The study was limited to a small number of patients, longitudinal studies on a larger cohort would help to understand the prognosis of the disease.ACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThe authors wish to thank the patients and participating investigators and staff associated with the clinical studies discussed here.

The WHO reported that a novel coronavirus (2019\u2010nCoV) was identified as the causative virus by Chinese authorities on 7 January 2020.3\nAs of 14 February 2020, 66\u2009492 accumulative laboratory\u2010confirmed cases and 1523 deaths have been reported in China, and 505 accumulative laboratory\u2010confirmed cases and 2 deaths in 24 countries other than China.4 To control the epidemic, the Chinese government mandated a quarantine of Wuhan city on 23 January 2020. The international community has paid close attention to the effectiveness of the quarantine.5, 6 Here, transmission dynamics of COVID\u201019 were performed, based on currently available epidemiological information to explore the effectiveness of the quarantine of Wuhan city against this epidemic.2 METHODS\n2.1 Data collection\nThe data of confirmed and suspected cases of COVID\u201019 acute respiratory disease reported by cities and provinces in mainland China were obtained from the following: The Health Commission of Wuhan City, the Health Commission of Hubei Province, the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China, and the World Health Organization situation reports.7, 10\n2.2 The well\u2010mixed SEIR compartmental model\nA well\u2010mixed susceptible\u2010exposed\u2010infectious\u2010recovered (SEIR) compartmental model was applied to describe the dynamics of the COVID\u201019 epidemic process, based on the epidemiological characteristics of individuals, clinical progression of COVID\u201019, and quarantine intervention measures of the authority. The model was parameterized by the data obtained from confirmed and suspected cases of COVID\u201019 reported by regions and provinces in China. This model was used to estimate the dynamics of COVID\u201019 in Wuhan city.\nCOVID\u201019 has an incubation period and exposed people with no symptoms can carry SARS\u2010CoV\u20102,11 unlike SARSr\u2010CoV. COVID\u201019 is contagious during the incubation period12; therefore, the SEIR compartmental model was modified in the present study. For the well\u2010mixed SEIRS model, the population under consideration is represented by four groups of individuals: susceptible (S) (vulnerable to SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection), exposed (E) (latent individuals and those capable of spreading SARS\u2010CoV\u20102), infectious (I) (symptomatic, capable of spreading SARS\u2010CoV\u20102), and recovered (R) (immune to the SARS\u2010CoV\u20102). The contact rates, r1 and r2, which represent the probability of susceptible persons coming into contact with an infected individual and latent individuals being infected, respectively. The infectious rates, \u03b21 and \u03b22, control the rate of spread. In this situation, \u03b21 represents the probability of infection per exposure when a susceptible individual (S) has contacted an infected patient (I) and becomes a latent exposed individual (E). While \u03b22 represents the potential rate per exposure when a susceptible individual (S) has mutual contact with an exposed individual (E), and transmits it to another exposed individual (E). Since there were controversies about the transmissibility of latent infection, we assumed that half of these asymptomatic latent infections were infectious, similar to influenza.13 So, we set \u03b22\u2009=\u20091/2\u2009\u00d7\u2009\u03b21. The incubation rate, \u03b1, is the rate of latent individuals becoming infectious (average duration of incubation is 1/\u03b1). The recovery rate, \u03b3\u2009=\u20091/D, is determined by the average duration time (day). The following system of equations summarizes the transmission dynamics model (Figure 1).\nFigure 1\nOpen in figure viewerPowerPoint\nDiagram of the well\u2010mixed susceptible\u2010exposed\u2010infectious\u2010recovered (SEI) model adopted in the present study for simulating the COVID\u201019\n2.3 Parameter estimations for COVID\u201019\nAs previously mentioned, the key parameters involved in this model include the initial values of the susceptible population, the exposed population, the symptomatic infected population, and the recovered population. These parameters are described in Table 1.\nTable 1.

Referring to the SARS epidemic data, the contact rate of infected individuals after quarantine and isolation is set to 6.18 In addition, the contact rate of latent individuals was measured as follows: the number of cumulative close contacts (739) divided by the number of confirmed cases (41), based on the report from the Health Commission of Wuhan City on 11 January 2020.16 A contact rate ranging from 6 to 18 was applied to analyze the spread of COVID\u201019 and the effectiveness of quarantine in Wuhan.\nThe probability of infection of susceptible individuals, which were infected by symptomatic exposed groups, could be estimated as the number of newly confirmed cases divided by the number of closed contacts, based on the report from the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China from 21 January 2020, to 19 February 2020.17 The average number, 4%, was set as the parameter in the model. The reciprocal value of the incubation period was set as the transition rate of latent individuals becoming infected individuals, and the reciprocal value of the duration of disease was estimated as the probability of recovering from an infection. According to the report, 7 and 21 days were set as the incubation period and duration of disease, respectively.19\n2.4 Simulation\nAccording to the report from the Health Commission of Wuhan City on 31 December 2019,15 27 cases of COVID\u201019 were confirmed, 2 patients had recovered, and latent individuals were estimated as 193, based on the 7\u2010day incubation period of COVID\u201019. The population of Wuhan is about 11\u2009081\u200900014; therefore, we set S (0)\u2009=\u200911,081,000 to 27\u20132 to 193\u2009=\u200911\u2009080\u2009778.\n2.5 Statistical analyses\nR software (version 3.6.1) was used for well\u2010mixed SEIR compartmental model analysis, with \u201cdeSolve\u201d and \u201cggplot2\u201d packages for calculating predicted parameters and plotting peak values. Curve estimation was analyzed by using Statistics Package for Social Sciences (ver. 16.0; SPSS Incorporated, Chicago, IL). Significance was identified if the null hypothesis could be rejected with more than 95% confidence. All P values are two\u2010tailed.3 RESULTS\n3.1 Well\u2010mixed SEIR model fitting\nThe well\u2010mixed SEIR model fitting results are presented in Figure 2 and Table 2. Noted that the model estimations are based on the assumed contact rate of latent individuals (6\u201018), which represent the possible impact of quarantine and isolation interventions on disease infections. We assumed the other parameters were constant under the current intervention.\nFigure 2\nOpen in figure viewerPowerPoint\nThe well\u2010mixed susceptible\u2010exposed\u2010infectious\u2010recovered (SEIR) model fitting results.

B, The well\u2010mixed SEIR model estimated the number of exposed individuals based on the suppose that the contact rate of latent individuals is 6 to 18. C, The well\u2010mixed SEIR model estimated the number of infected individuals based on the suppose that the contact rate of latent individuals is 6 to 18. D, The well\u2010mixed SEIR model estimated the number of removed individuals based on the suppose that the contact rate of latent individuals is 6 to 18\nTable 2.

To explore the possible impact of quarantine and isolation interventions on COVID\u201019 spread, we plotted the number of exposed individuals, the number of infected individuals, the number of removed individuals, and the number of susceptible individuals and contact rates of latent individuals. As shown in Figure 2 and Table 2, the results suggest that lowering the contact rate of latent individuals consistently reduces the number of infected individuals but may delay the peak in infections.\n3.2 Curve estimation of predicted and actual values of infected individuals\nCurve estimation was applied to investigate the relationship between the predicted cases of COVID\u201019, based on the well\u2010mixed SEIR model, and reported cases of COVID\u201019, based on the report from the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China. The curve estimation procedure produces curve estimation regression statistics and related plots to 11 different curve estimation regression models. A separate model is produced for each dependent variable. In the analysis model of curve estimation, the number of actual reported cases of COVID\u201019 from 10 January 2020 to 29 February 2020, was set as the dependent variable. And the number of predicted cases of COVID\u201019 based on the well\u2010mixed SEIR model, in which the contact rate of latent individuals is set as 18 from 10 January 2020 to 29 February 2020, was set as the independent variable. The R2 values of the linear, logarithmic, inverse, quadratic, cubic, power, compound, S\u2010curve, growth, and exponential models were 0.938, 0.603, 0.132, 0.977, 0.981, 0.816, 0.975, 0.402, 0.816, 0.816, and 0.816, respectively (all P\u2009<\u2009.01) (Table 3 and Figure 3). The most suitable description for the relationship between the predicted and actual values of the infected individuals' curve was the cubic model. Therefore, the cubic model was used to estimate the relationship between the predicted and actual values of infected individuals in the present study.\nTable 3.

The curve estimation of the cubic model results with varying contact rates of latent individuals is shown in Figure 4. Therefore, predicted cases of COVID\u201019 based on the well\u2010mixed SEIR model are in good agreement with the reported cases of COVID\u201019 based on the report.\nTable 4.

Using existing data and incorporating these data with the well\u2010mixed SEIR compartmental model, our results suggest that reducing the contact rate of latent individuals after quarantine and isolation can effectively reduce the number of individuals infected with COVID\u201019 and delay the peak time. Prevention and control of COVID\u20102019 epidemics require a better understanding of its mode of geographical dissemination. Different from the coronavirus diseases we have experienced, such as SARS and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome are not contagious during asymptomatic infection, the incubation period of asymptomatic patients with COVID\u201019 is extremely contagious to close contacts.20 Although measures such as quarantine and isolation were taken early in the outbreak to reduce the contact rate of infected individuals, it is crucial to reduce the contact rate of latent individuals. By decreasing the contact rate to latent individuals, the number of infections decreases and the peak time is delayed, which is shown in Table 2 and Figure 2. Therefore, movement restriction and community containment measures, such as quarantine and isolation, are essential to control the spread of COVID\u201019.\nThe models were used to fit the actual reported cases in Wuhan City from the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China. The curve estimation program generates curve estimation regression statistics and correlation graphs for 11 different curve estimation regression models. R2 of the cubic model is 0.981, which is the highest in 11 different curve estimation regression models and this indicated that using the cubic model to estimate the relationship between the predicted value and the actual value of infected individuals is more accurate than the other curve estimation regression models. As indicated by Table 3 and Figure 3, combined with actual reported cases, the contact rate of latent individuals in the well\u2010mixed SEIR model is set to 18, which can accurately simulate the trend of infected individuals. As mentioned above, the curve estimation of the cubic model results, with different contact rates of latent individuals from 6 to 18, gave R2 values of 0.954, 0.945, 0.943, 0.952, 0.970, 0.985, 0.992, 0.992, 0.989, 0.980, 0.932, 0.990, and 0.981 (all P\u2009<\u2009.01). Thus, the well\u2010mixed SEIR model\u2010based prediction of COVID\u201019 cases is consistent with the reported data.\nAccurately identifying the epidemic trend in advance is critical for infectious disease prevention and control.21 The well\u2010mixed SEIR model can provide a reference for evaluating the effects of intervention measures. While the basic assumptions are established, especially in the absence of external intervention, the establishment of a dynamic model based on early epidemic data, or model prediction based on prior parameters, can clearly predict the development of the epidemic without intervention. The traditional public health measures of quarantine and isolation are the most effective measures to control the novel coronavirus outbreak, for which we currently have no specific therapeutics or vaccines. However, quarantining and isolating infected individuals and latent individuals at the beginning of the outbreak period would have been a strategic preventative measure.\nHowever, there are several limitations to this study that must be discussed, namely, too many parameters and nonconstant parameters. Before the mandated quarantine of Wuhan city on 23 January 2020, the population of Wuhan fluctuated; thus, the exact population of Wuhan cannot be determined. In addition, the parameters of the population contact rate were not from an accurate data set. Due to quarantine and isolation measures, the contact rate is constantly changing. Furthermore, we did not consider the rate of change in personal activity, such as wearing masks, increasing social distance, and ceasing travel to Wuhan. Thus, the estimates of virus imports may not be totally accurate. Finally, our models are based on human\u2010to\u2010human transmission. The possibility of outbreaks caused by fomites or contamination of the water system by infected feces was not taken into account. Therefore, if reported data on population mobility, epidemiological characteristics, and viral transmission mechanisms were considered by the models, the accuracy and validity of the estimates would improve.\nIn conclusion, we developed a well\u2010mixed SEIR compartmental model to describe the dynamics of the COVID\u201019 epidemic process. The fitting results of the well\u2010mixed SEIR model assumed that the contact rate of latent individuals is between 6 and 18, representing the possible impact of isolation and quarantine measures on the disease infection rate. The results suggest that interventions, by reducing the contact rate, such as isolation and quarantine, can effectively reduce the peak number of COVID\u201019 infections and delay the peak time of infections.ACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nWe would like to acknowledge colleagues for helpful comments.

The cumulative number of confirmed cases in Europe is 30\u2009307, of which 1206 have died. A total of 21\u2009194 cases have been confirmed in Asia (excluding China), with 545 deaths. The clinical manifestations of COVID\u201019 are similar to the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) broken out in 2003, which has longer latency and stronger infectivity. This has led to severe shortages of medical resources and infections of health care workers. Peng et al reported 138 patients were admitted to Zhongnan Hospital in Wuhan, including 40 medical staff (29%).2 Another retrospective analysis of 1099 confirmed patients with COVID\u201019 (the diagnosis date is up to January 29) in 552 hospitals from 31 provinces found that the proportion of health professionals was 2.09%.3 Various indications have shown that medical staff infections are at an unavoidable risk of infection. Besides, little is known on the infection status of the medical staff currently hospitalized, and their basic demographic characteristics, disease severity distribution, computed tomography (CT) image characteristics, and treatment status.2 METHODS\n2.1 Patients\nIn this retrospective study, the medical staff, who work at Tongji Hospital, were diagnosed as COVID\u201019 and admitted to the hospital in Wuhan, China, from 7 January to 11 February 2020. The hospitalized COVID\u201019 medical staff were classified as first\u2010line departments (including emergency department, fever clinic, fever ward, respiratory and critical care department, and infection department), nonemergency Clinics/wards (other clinical department), medical technology departments (examination and testing departments), and others (administrative logistics departments) according to their work sections. Two of the 54 medical staff (from the medical technology department and other departments respectively) have a history of close contact with the staff outside the hospital, and the remaining 52 staff have no history of contact with the staff outside the hospital. We all know that new coronary pneumonia is highly contagious, and medical staff have more opportunities to closely contact patients diagnosed with COVID\u201019. Therefore, medical staff at Tongji Hospital have been arranged to live in designated hotels and have no chance to be with other staff.\nA retrospective single center case series of 54 inpatients were recruited from Tongji Hospital, Wuhan, China. All patients with COVID\u201019 enrolled in this study were diagnosed according to World Health Organization interim guidance.3 The confirmed patients were clinically classified according to the \"Pneumonia Diagnosis and Treatment Protocol for novel coronavirus (SARS coronavirus 2 [SARS\u2010Cov\u20102]) infected pneumonia (trial version 5).\"4\nEpidemiological, clinical, and management data are obtained from each inpatient between 7 January and 11 February 2020. This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology. If some of the data were missed from the records or clarification was needed, we obtained data by direct communication with the attending doctors and health\u00adcare providers.\n2.2 Patient and public involvement\nPatients or the public were not involved in the development or implementation of this study.\n2.3 Procedures\nLaboratory confirmation of SARS\u2010Cov\u20102 infection was done in Tongji Hospital. Throat\u00adswab specimens from the upper respiratory tract were collected from inpatients. The throat swab was placed into a collection tube with virus preservation solution, and total RNA was extracted using two different respiratory sample RNA isolation kits approved by the Food and Drug Administration of China (Huirui and Bojie, Shanghai, China). Two target genes, including the open reading frame 1ab (ORF1ab) and the nucleocapsid protein (N), were simultaneously amplified by real\u2010time reverse transcription\u2010polymerase chain reaction (RT\u2010PCR). The reaction mixture consisted of 7.5\u2009\u03bcL reaction buffer, 1.5\u2009\u03bcL enzyme solution, 5\u2009\u03bcL ORF1ab/N gene reaction solution, 5 to 11\u2009\u03bcL RNA template, and 25\u2009\u03bcL RNase free pure water. The RT\u2010PCR reactions were subjected to 50\u00b0C for 15\u2009minutes, incubation at 95\u00b0C for 5\u2009minutes, denaturation at 95\u00b0C for 45 cycles for 10\u2009seconds, and fluorescence signal acquisition at 55\u00b0C for 45\u2009seconds. Target gene test was that ORF1ab gene was detected by FAM channel, and N gene was detected by HEX/VIC channel. Negative: Ct\u2009>\u200938 or not detected; positive: the amplification curve was s\u2010shaped, and the Ct value was \u226435; suspicious: the amplification curve was s\u2010shaped, and 35\u2009<\u2009Ct\u2009\u2264\u200938, requiring reexamination; If the reexamination results are consistent, the determination results are positive for the nucleic acid test of the gene. In addition, SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 nucleic acid test positive interpretation criteria are divided into two aspects, first, in the same specimen, ORF1ab and N genes tested positive at the same time; second, the ORF1ab or N gene was positive in two different samples of the same patient. These diagnostic criteria are based on the recommendations of the National Institute for Viral Disease Control and Prevention (China).\n2.4 Data collection\nBasic data were collected, including age, gender, department, first symptoms, date of onset, CT scan and treatment plan. Specifically, it was the medical workers confirmed with COVID\u201019 in Tongji hospital from 7 January to 11 February 2020, which included a total of 54 medical inpatients. According to nucleic acid test results and CT imaging, they were distinguished between nucleic acid\u2010positive COVID\u201019 and clinical diagnosis of patients with COVID\u201019. And patients will be divided into common\u2010type, severe type and critical\u2010type by the latest guidelines of COVID\u201019.4\n2.5 Statistical analysis\nIn this study, we divided the samples into common\u2010type, severe type/critical\u2010type according to the patient's condition, and divided the samples into nucleic acid\u2010positive COVID\u201019 and clinical diagnosis of COVID\u201019 according to the results of viral nucleic acid test and CT test. So that comparing different groups in demographic characteristics, clinical characteristics, CT manifestations, and treatment differences. Categorical variables were described as count (%), and continuous measurements were described using median and Range. Comparisons for the proportions of categorical variables were conducted using the \u03c72 test or the Fisher exact test. The Wilcoxon rank sum test was used for the comparative analysis of continuous variables. All statistical tests were two\u2010sided, and P\u2009<\u2009.05 was considered as statistically significant. The Stata (version 15.1 SE) was employed for all statistical analyses.\n2.6 Role of the funding source\nThe funders of the study had no role in the study design, data collection, data analysis, data interpretation, or writing of the report. The corresponding authors had full access to all the data in the study and had final responsibility for the decision to submit for publication.3 RESULTS\nAmong all 54 hospitalized medical staff from Tongji Hospital diagnosed with COVID\u201019 from 7 January to 11 February of 2020, 2 cases were from emergency department (3.7%); 39 cases were from other clinical departments (72.2%); 10 cases were from medical technology departments (18.5%); and 3 cases were from others (5.6%) (Figure 1). Much higher incidence of SRAS\u2010Cov\u20102 infection was noted for those medical staff from clinical departments than that from others. The earliest onset date of COVID\u201019 (7 January 2020) was noted in those medical staff from the emergency department, while the remaining onset dates were mostly clustered between 22 January and 3 February 2020 in medical staff from all other departments.\nFigure 1\nOpen in figure viewerPowerPoint\nDate if illness onset and departments distribution of medical staff with confirmed COVID\u201019 infection. Presented the stack bar graph of COVID\u201019 infected cases in different departments of medical staff. The vertical axis indicated the number of COVID\u201019 infected cases, and the horizontal axis indicated the illness onset date. The red presented the emergency department, the blue presented the nonemergency clinics, the green presented the technology department, and the orange presented other departments from hospital. COVID\u201019, coronavirus disease 2019\nEleven out of 54 patients with COVID\u201019 were categorized as common\u2010type, while 40 as severe\u2010type, and 3 as critical\u2010type. Unexpectedly, the median age for the common\u2010type patients was significantly elder than that of severe\u2010/critical\u2010type patients (47 years vs 38 years; P\u2009=\u2009.015). Among 11 common\u2010type patients, 5 cases (45.5%) were females and 6 cases (54.5%) were males. However, more male patients (30/43, 69.8%) were found with severe\u2010/critical\u2010type as compared with females (13/43, 30.2%). Fever was the main first symptoms of SARS\u2010Cov\u20102 infection both in common\u2010type (81.8%) and severe\u2010/critical\u2010type patients (62.8%), followed by cough (27.3% vs 32.6%). Similarly, comparison of additional symptoms between common\u2010type and severe\u2010/critical\u2010type patients also failed to detect a significant difference, such as diarrhea (0% vs 7.0%), chill (0% vs 4.7%), sore throat (0% vs 2.3%), chest tightness (9.1% vs 7.0%), rhinorrhea (0% vs 2.3%), inappetence (0% vs 7.0%), expectoration (0% vs 7.0%), nervous (0% vs 2.3%), nausea (0% vs 2.3%), muscle ache (9.1% vs 4.7%), and globus sensation (0% vs 2.3%). However, higher proportion of common\u2010type patients displayed fatigue (36.4% vs 11.6%), and dyspnea (27.3% vs 4.7%) as compared with that of severe\u2010/critical\u2010type patients (Table 1).\nTable 1.

Data are n (%) unless specified otherwise.\na P values were calculated from Fisher's exact test between two different groups.\nb P values were calculated by the Wilcoxon rank sum test.\nc P values were calculated by \u03c72 indicates that the P values were approximately 1.\nAll 54 patients conducted SARS\u2010Cov\u20102 nucleic acid tests, but only 38 were positive for the tests, and the 16 patients negative for SARS\u2010Cov\u20102 tests showed manifested pathological changes in CT\u2010scans were also diagnosed as COVID\u201019. The median age of patients positive for SARS\u2010Cov\u20102 tests (39 years) was comparable to that of patients negative for the tests (46 years). In patients positive for SARS\u2010Cov\u20102 tests, 14 were females (36.8%) and 24 were males (63.2%). However, higher proportion of male patients (12/16, 75%) was found in those negative SARS\u2010Cov\u20102 tests (4/16, 25%). Fever was the main initial symptoms both in SARS\u2010Cov\u20102 tests positive (65.8%) or negative (68.8%) patients. Similarly, comparisons of additional symptoms between positive and negative patients for SARS\u2010Cov\u20102 tests, such as cough (31.6% vs 31.3%), diarrhea (5.3% vs 6.3%), chill (5.3% vs 0%), sore throat (2.6% vs 0%), chest tightness (5.3% vs 12.5%), dyspnea (7.9% vs 12.5%), rhinorrhea (2.6% vs 0%, fatigue (18.4% vs 12.5%), inappetence (5.3% vs 6.3%), expectoration (5.3% vs 6.3%), nervous (0% vs 6.3%), nausea (2.6% vs 0%), muscle ache (5.3% vs 6.3%), and globus sensation (2.6% vs 0%) also failed to detect a perceptible difference (Table 1).\nAll the medical staff performed chest CT\u2010scans at the time of admission. Remarkably, chest CT images were missing in two nucleic acid\u2010positive patients, and were suggested virus\u2010infected pneumonia in 52 out of 54 inpatients. Among those 52 patients, 11 were manifested as common\u2010type, while the rest 41 cases were characterized as severe\u2010/critical\u2010type patients. It was noted that the typical CT images derived either from common\u2010type or severe\u2010/critical\u2010type patients with COVID\u201019 were characterized by the ground glass\u2010like shadows (63.6% vs 78.1%), fibrous stripes (54.6% vs 51.2%), patchy shadow (36.4% vs 43.9%), and pleural thickening (18.2% vs 29.3%). Other imaging features included nodules (18.2% vs 24.4%), consolidation (18.2% vs 9.8%), and pleural effusion (9.1% vs 9.8%). Of note, severe\u2010/critical\u2010type patients were featured by the higher severity of lymphadenia (29.3% vs 9.1%) and interstitial thickening (7.3% vs 0%) but with no significant difference. Furthermore, significantly higher proportion of patients positive for SARS\u2010Cov\u20102 tests displayed patchy shadow (19/36, 52.8%) in the CT\u2010cans than that of patients negative for the tests (3/16, 18.8%, P\u2009=\u2009.022). Analysis of the lesion sites in CT\u2010scans revealed that those severe\u2010/critical\u2010type of patients were more likely to exhibit lesions in the right lung (61% vs 18.2%; P\u2009=\u2009\u00b7012) of upper lobe or right lung (31.7% vs 0%; P\u2009=\u2009\u00b7028) (Table 2).\nTable 2.

Immunoglobin, interferon, and thymosin were initiated in 33.3%, 33.3%, and 7.4% of patients, respectively. Significantly higher proportion of common\u2010type patients received interferon therapy as compared with that of severe\u2010/critical patients (63.6% vs 25.6%; P\u2009=\u2009.023) (Table 2). One critical\u2010type of patients died of day 9 of admission, while ECOM was adopted to other two critical\u2010type patients. Seven common\u2010type patients have already been discharged, and the rests are going to be discharged. Similarly, four severe\u2010type patients were discharged from hospitalization, and the rests are under recovery (Table 2).4 DISCUSSION\nAt the press conference on \u201cjoint prevention and control of COVID\u201019\u201d by the State Council of China, Ceng Yixin, deputy director of the National Health Commission, declared that as of 24:00 on 11 February, 1716 cases of COVID\u201019 had been confirmed in medical staff across the country, accounting for 3.8% of all confirmed cases, among them, six had died, accounting for 0.4% of national deaths. Among the 1716 cases, 1502 cases were in Hubei Province, and 1102 cases in Wuhan City. Wuhan Tongji Hospital in Hubei is the largest Grade\u2010A Tertiary Hospital, which provided the most beds during the battle against the epidemic. This study analyzed the 54 medical staff infections in Tongji Hospital from 7 January to 11 February 2020, including 2 cases (3.7%) from first\u2010line departments, 39 cases (72.2%) from non\u2010first\u2010line departments, 10 (18.5%) from medical medical technology departments, and 3 (5.6%) from administrative and logistics departments. Such pattern of distribution was similar to that reported by Wang et al2 on 7 February 2020, which indicated that among the 40 medical staff infections, 31 (77.5%) worked in general wards, 7 (17.5%) in emergency room, and 2 (5%) in intensive care unit. Analysis of onset time suggested that earliest infections occurred in the emergency department, which began to show symptoms on 7 January 2020, and the other cases showed symptoms mostly from 22 January to 3 February 2020, then from 4 February on, number of new cases gradually decreased. The causes of such pattern of medical staff infection may include: firstly, the COVID\u201019 has many atypical clinical manifestations, so the patients may go to different departments for treatment. As the disease may be contagious during the incubation period,5, 6 many medical staff are not adequately protected and become infected via unwitting contact with the patients. Second, it is important to note there were not sufficient reserves of protective equipment in the hospital for a pandemic of such severity. The protective equipment, such as protective clothing, N95 masks, and goggles are prioritized to first\u2010line medical staff in fever clinics and fever wards, while other staff often have only surgical masks at best, which explains the lower infection rates in medical staff directly facing the infected than medical staff who are less exposed. Third, according to the article by Wang et al2 on 7 February 2020, among the 138 cases admitted by Wuhan Zhongnan Hospital, 17 cases (12.3%) were hospitalized for reasons other than pneumonia, such as conditions that requires surgery and tumors, including 7 cases in the surgery department, 5 cases in the internal medicine department, and 5 cases in the oncology department. These cases may even have been infected during hospitalization. As patients in hospital frequently contact inpatient caregivers and visitors that frequently go in and out of hospital and are at high risk of getting infected, which exacerbates infections of medical staff not in direct contact with the known infected patients. Fourth, the infected medical staff may be asymptomatic but infectious, which may lead to clustered infection in a department.7\nAnother notable feature of the medical staff infections by COVID\u201019 in Tongji Hospital, was the high rate of severe and critical cases. The 54 cases included 40 severe cases and 3 critical cases (79% in total), a ratio much higher than what's reported on the N Engl J MED by Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital,8 in which only 32% of the 41 hospitalized patients were severe or critical cases. Another unusual feature of the 54 cases was that the 11 common cases were 47 years old on average, while the 43 severe and critical cases were 38 years old on average\u2014the common\u2010type cases were significantly elder than the severe or critical cases, which was contrary to what's reported by Huang et al and Wang et al1 Such contradiction may be explained by (a) the lower ratio of elder people among the medical staff; (b) the longer work time and higher work intensity of the medical staff aged 38 years or so, as they are the mainstay of a hospital. However, the latter is currently only based on empirical assumption and not supported by quantitative analysis.\nCT revealed that compared with the common cases, the severe and critical cases showed more involvement of the right lung (61% vs 18.2%; P\u2009=\u2009.012), especially right upper lung (31.7% vs 0%; P\u2009=\u2009.028). Similarly, Goh et al9 reported that severe consolidation in SARS occurred in the upper right lobe of patients. Wong et al10 reported 108 cases of SARS patients, in which right lung involvement (82/108, 75.9%) was more common, these results are exactly the same as our statistical results. It is worthwhile to further explore the mechanism of this phenomenon, which ca make us identify the severe and critical cases in medical staff. In Hubei, the epicenter, many patients had positive CT images but showed negative results in the nucleic acid test.11 To better address such patients, on 13 February 2020, the General Office of the National Health Commission and the State Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine issued the guideline \u201cClinical Diagnosis of COVID\u201019 (Fifth Edition on trial),\u201d4 which added \u201cclinical diagnosed\u201d to the classification of the new coronavirus\u2010infected pneumonia. The \u201cclinical diagnosed\u201d classification refers to cases that had characteristic clinical manifestations of infection but were negative in the nucleic acid test. We compared the nucleic acid\u2010positive and \u2010negative cases, and found that the two groups showed no significant differences in age, gender, or symptoms, but the former had a higher ratio of patchy shadows on CT images than the latter (19/36, 52.8% vs 3/16, 18.8%). As most of the patients are still hospitalized at the time of submission, we can hardly evaluate the significance of nucleic acid test results in prognosis, which require further observation of the natural history of the disease.\nBasing on these analyses, we suggest training for all hospital staff to prevent infection, especially those in departments not so alert about virus infection as those directly facing patients in fever; and preparation of sufficient protection and disinfection materials. For patients who are currently hospitalized due to other diseases, chest CT and/or nucleic acid tests should be performed as soon as possible in case of fever or respiratory symptoms, and if the diagnosis is positive in either CT or nucleic acid test, the patient must be transferred to designated hospitals immediately for further treatment. Medical staff of 38 years old or so shall receive extra care and protection due to their susceptibility to severe infection, and when a medical personal is infected, changes in right lung and upper right lobe should be noticed for earlier detection of severe cases.ACKNOWLEDGMENT\nThis study was supported by the Clinical Research Physician Program of Tongji Medical College; the Huazhong University of Science and Technology [Grant 5001540075].CONFLICT OF INTERESTS\nThe authors of this article declare no relationships with any companies whose products or services may be related to the subject matter of the article.AUTHOR CONTRIBUTION\nWe are indebted to the direction of Prof. Shu Zhang, Prof. Congyi Wang, Prof. Xiaoping Miao, Prof. Jianping Zhao, Prof. Wenhua Liu, Prof. Juan Li, Prof.Huilan Zhang.

The WHO officials also raised serious concerns that Pakistan might emerge as the next epicenter of this pandemic.5 In Pakistan, the first case of COVID\u201019 was travel\u2010associated; infected individuals returned from Iran on 26 February 2020.6 As the first case surfaced, the Ministry of Health began implementing the COVID\u201019 control framework which included isolation of suspects and quarantining of infected individuals. However, the situation worsened gradually and on 17 March, total cases rose to 237.7 In response to the looming fears of an emerging epidemic, officials took additional steps to control COVID\u201019 community transmission. Important measures that were taken included quarantine, urging the healthy public to self\u2010isolate and practice social distancing strategies to avoid COVID\u201019 infection.8\nFormal (newspapers, press releases, and educational messages) and informal sources (social media, online reviews, views of family and peers) of information play a role in improving situational awareness in times of public health emergencies.9-13 Retaining situational awareness comprises of perception which relies on these information sources.10 Effective and timely management of infections is greatly dependent on social distancing behavior; perception plays a vital role in the adoption of protective behavioral response.14-16\nIn this study, we have used situational awareness theory (SAT) in conjunction with the theory of planned behavior (TPB). The Endsley model describes SA at three levels: perception which makes the base of SA; perceived information, that is, comprehension is the second level, and projection is the third level.17 This theory has been used by researchers for gaining improved awareness for the management of emergencies in health care.17-20 TBP does not take into account effect of social awareness on infectious diseases.21, 22 Therefore, where this theory has been used for existing behavior change theoretical frameworks, which have been adapted for prediction of health\u2010related behavior change in chronic and noncommunicable diseases, there is a lack of a comprehensive evidence\u2010based model of protective behavior against infectious disease threat.\nThe SAT has been used earlier during the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic by research groups for reporting public perception of SARS outside the affected region. Studies carried out in the initial phase of outbreak reported lower SA, that is, 9%\u201030%; however, as information became widespread, later studies reported greater awareness among masses. The hypothesis proposed in this study has been devised after careful consideration of previously reported literature (Figure 1).23-25\nFigure 1\nOpen in figure viewerPowerPoint\nThe proposed health care protective model. This figure represents the hypothesis on which the survey was conducted. It shows that formal and informal sources of information play a significant role in developing awareness which, in turn, impacts the adoption of social distancing behavior2 METHODS\n2.1 Research design\nA questionnaire\u2010based survey was carried; for details of the questionnaire see Table S1. For the measurement of responses 5\u2010point Likert scale was used. Age, sex, location, and education were the demographic characteristics of the study population. An open\u2010ended question was also added at the end of the questionnaire to record the general opinion of participants on COVID\u201019.\nThe designed questionnaire was then reviewed by two PhD students and two molecular virologists, in terms of construct items, understanding the ability and contextual relevance after a few changes as suggested after the pilot test, an online link was generated for response collection. A total of 210 responses was received.\n2.2 Measurement model\nCollected responses were screened, and both multivariate and univariate outliers were detected and deleted.26 Also, skewness and kurtosis analysis were performed; a reflective measurement model requires three tests, that is, internal consistency, convergent, and discriminant validity.27 The internal consistency was validated using composite reliability (CR), threshold value: 0.70.\nFornell and Larcker27 and Henseler et al,28, 29 were used for the assessment of discriminant validity using a multitrait\u2010multimethod matrix. Specifically, heterotrait\u2010monotrait ratio (HTMT) value, 0.85, is considered a threshold to ensure discriminant validity (Table 1).\nTable 1.

PLS is a well\u2010established technique with path analytics modeling and is used for testing causal models through both reflective and formative constructs.35-38 The model proposed here was tested by Smart PLS Version 2.M to perform analysis in two stages using structural equation modeling: the measurement model (first\u2010order confirmatory factor analysis) and structural model assessment (Table 2).\n2.5 Sentiment analysis\nWe analyzed sentiments for 82 responses against the open\u2010ended question. The sentiment analysis becomes a dominant information source in people's daily life which helps in decision\u2010making.39 We used a manual approach to assign a specific category to each opinion based on its inherent meaning (semantics). Degree of prediction (so that a review belongs to a certain category) was measured by assigning labels manually: A, B, and C for regular, comparative, and suggestive reviews, respectively.40 This method resembles the closed card sorting method.413 RESULTS\n3.1 Characteristics of respondents\nFigure 2A\u2010C show a summary of the demographic characteristics, that is, age, sex, and education of the respondents who filled in the online survey.\nFigure 2\nOpen in figure viewerPowerPoint\nDemographics of respondents. The pie charts show the demographics of the respondents in terms of sex, age, and education. A, Age; 39% participants belonged to 18 to 24 (blue) years of age, followed by 25 to 34 years (red). Other age groups were 35 to 44 years, 45 to 54 years, 55 to 64 years, and above 65. B, Sex; 59% females (red) and 41% males (blue) participated in the study. C, Education; majority of the participants, that is, 60% were diploma or masters holders (red)\n3.2 Measurement model\nTable 2 indicates that all variables have values lower than the threshold, that is, 0.70 and therefore CR has adequate loadings to satisfy internal consistency reliability. Hence, convergent validity evaluation ensures that items put together explain 50% construct.\nWe used the average variance explained (AVE) threshold value, 0.50, as suggested by Rasoolimanesh et al.30 All values are greater than 0.50 to justify the convergent validity of the items. Results of this study reveal that the studied variable fall within threshold range indicating that the constructs used in the survey were constructive.\nTherefore, this study proposes a theoretical model that incorporates the influence of information sources on COVID\u201019 awareness and its impact on distancing behavior (Figure 1).\nIn essence, the study fully satisfies all necessary tests to ensure fit and satisfactory measurement model, as identified above.\n3.3 Structural model\nThe R2 value of the obtained responses fell in a weak category for perceived understanding (0.095) and social distancing (0.116), respectively. Specifically, exogenous variables identified in this study explain 10% and 12% variances. To assess a reliable path coefficient, bootstrapping and percentile bootstrap confidence interval (95%) were used. Accordingly, the path coefficient relationship between information dimensions and perceived understanding performance was also tested.\nIt was found that formal and informal information sources significantly affect perceived understanding. Formal information has a statistically significant effect on perceived understanding (\u03b2\u2009=\u2009.183; t\u2009=\u20093.067, P\u2009=\u2009.001). Informal information is also significantly associated with perceived understanding (\u03b2\u2009=\u2009.234; t\u2009=\u20092.440; P\u2009=\u2009.007) (Table 3). Statistical analysis also shows that perceived understanding (\u03b2\u2009=\u2009.340; t\u2009=\u20094.794; P\u2009=\u2009.000) is significantly related to the adoption of social distancing (Figure 3). These results lead to the acceptance of the proposed hypothesis.\nTable 3.

The figure is a visual representation of the structural model developed using the responses collected by gathering public opinion on situational awareness of COVID\u201019 to adopt social distancing behavior\nOnce the basic requirements of the inner model were fulfilled; F2 and Q2 were analyzed to determine the effect of an exogenous variable on the endogenous variable and predictive relevance of the whole model. In this study, it is identified that formal and informal information has a small effect, that is, 0.037 and 0.060, while perceived understanding has a medium effect, that is, 131. For this study, the model has predictive relevance because it recorded a Q2 value of 0.028 and 0.067 for perceived understanding and social distancing, respectively, which are greater than zero.\n3.4 Sentiment analysis\nResults indicate that more than 50% of opinions are suggestive. People in urban areas are strongly opinionated that serious protective measures are needed, some of them are satisfied with the health\u2010protective behavior (HPB) and few shared their concerns and appear to be panicked. Some of the respondents have compared the behavior of the general public with government policies while others have shared concerns about the future strategic development of COVID\u201019.4 DISCUSSION\nA hypothetical model that evaluated the effect of formal and informal sources of information on situational awareness (perceived understanding) and ultimately adoption of protective behavior (social distancing) was studied. Results obtained suggest that both formal and informal sources of information affect situational awareness on HPB, that is, social distancing. The findings of this study are consistent with the previous reports which have suggested that HPB is linked directly to situational awareness during a public health emergency.42\nWhen comparing the trust of the general public on information sources, it was revealed that trust in the formal sources is slightly higher in comparison with informal sources. Moreover, another outcome of this study, that is, situational awareness affects the adoption of social distancing behavior which is also consistent with the previously reported surveys conducted to evaluate the effect of formal information sources on the adoption of HPB during A/H1N1 influenza pandemic 2009.9 Rubin and his colleagues reported that information from media sources increased the adoption of hygiene behavior which led to increased tissue and sanitizer use among British masses during the endemic swine flu.42\nThe model developed in this study suggested that social distancing is not linked with formal messages. This outcome supports the fact that social distancing is adopted when a perceived health threat is high.22 Another outcome suggests that when friends and peers behave responsibly, a person also adopts protective behavior. However, mixed signals from peers and friends led to the declined utility of informal information sources. This behavior is common in the early epidemic spread and awareness increases with advances in the transmission of infection which ultimately leads to widespread adoption of HPB. However, only an increase in formal information sources led to increased adoption of HPB. Adoption of HPBs is a good choice to remain safe from viral contamination. Contrarily, the practice of social distancing necessitates an activity of constant public education. Different divisions of populations share varying information in their circles.\nIn addition, the sentiment analysis was carried out on a few textual opinions to find some useful insights. This may guide future studies to explore in depth the opinions on a large scale and provide help to policymakers to look into highlighted threats and to control COVID\u201019. The sentiment analysis performed on the responses collected via open\u2010ended questions suggests that people are not much concerned for avoiding avoid mass gatherings and adopting social distancing practices; however, when influenced by informative tools they tend to adopt HPB to avoid acquiring any infection.43\nThe outbreak of any emerging infectious agent leads to the emergence of dynamic and uncertain situations; therefore, such emergencies need prompt and appropriate response.16 This implies that protective health behavior in case of emerging infectious diseases is more likely to be dependent on situational responses taking into account known preventive actions like social distancing rather than using intention\u2010based response like the decision to visit a doctor.8\nA few limitations of this study are that as the sample size is limited to the number of participants from one region and relatively small to generalize the findings of this study for a larger population, a bigger population\u2010based study should be carried out. Moreover, this study takes into consideration substantial factors that create situational awareness for the adoption of HPB; however, other factors such as the adoption of hand hygiene, knowledge of COVID\u201019, and self\u2010efficacy in the prevention of COVID\u201019 can also be added in the large sample size\u2010based study.\nCOVID\u201019 is a new pandemic prevailing around the world. It is expanding rapidly in North America, Europe, the Middle East, and Asia. In South Asia, Pakistan is the first country to experience a high severity of CVOID\u201019 infection. Our study concludes that at the time of such a public health crisis formal information sources (formal and informal) play a significant role in increasing awareness among masses and cognitively influence the adoption of social distancing practices.5 CONCLUSION\nThe world is facing serious COVID\u201019 pandemic; this necessitates situational awareness for the adoption of health care protective practices. We believe that the variables studied have theoretical and logical support for their potential importance in the context of COVID\u201019. Our findings suggest that different information sources (formal and informal) influence situational awareness. Findings suggest that formal information sources are associated with greater compliance with preventive measures; however, informal information sources might not help much until preventive behaviors are adopted readily by the community. Finally, social distancing practices can be increased by increasing awareness about COVID\u201019 through trustworthy information sources.CONFLICT OF INTERESTS\nThe authors declare that there are no conflict of interests.", "25889": "Aims\nComorbidities are associated with the severity of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (Covid\u201019).

World Health Organization (WHO) has declared coronavirus disease\u20102019 (COVID\u201019) a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. Various changes in environmental factors and human behaviors have led towards the emergence of more than 30 new infectious diseases in the last 3 decades, ranging from rotavirus to Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus.1 The increasing human population, people movement across diverse borders, rapid expansion of air traffic, changes in the climate have modified the ecosystem has made these novel pathogens can easily spread across the world.2 COVID\u201019\nOn 31st December 2019, Chinese health authorities investigated a cluster of atypical cases of pneumonia mainly occurring in individuals who visited Huanan seafood wholesale Market in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China. From 31st December 2019 to 3rd January 2020, a total of 44 patients developed symptoms like cough, fever, and chest discomfort or respiratory illness, being diagnosis of pneumonia constituted by chest radiographs and computed tomographic scans.2 During this period, the causal agent was not known. After testing for the causes of respiratory infection encode the negative result, an unbiased sequence of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid identified a \u03b2\u2010coronavirus variant with sequences similarity of 85% corresponding to a bat severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) like coronavirus (CoV).2 Later, the virus was isolated in eukaryotic cells culture, and further identification indicated that it was distinct from SARS\u2010CoV (sequence homology 79%) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)\u2010CoV (sequence homology 50%).3 The sequences were deposited in GenBank (accession number MN908947). The International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses named this CoV variant as SARS\u2010CoV\u20102,4 representing the 7th CoV to cause disease in human beings, and 3rd CoV since 2003 to spread from animals to humans related with respiratory illness.2 WHO has named this respiratory illness as coronavirus disease\u20102019 (COVID\u201019) caused by SARS\u2010CoV\u20102.\nAs of 19th April 2020, the COVID\u201019 outbreak had resulted in nearly 2.24 million laboratory\u2010confirmed cases, including 1.52 lakhs death all around the world.5 Currently, no suitable vaccines or antiviral drugs are available for SARS\u2010CoV\u20102. Early warning is very crucial measures to control the outbreak and epidemics of infectious diseases. Rapid and reliable diagnostic methods for the detection of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 is crucial for public health interventions that can minimize the spread of COVID\u201019.3 THE CLINICAL FEATURES OF COVID\u201019\nSARS\u2010CoV\u20102 causes pneumonia with clinical symptoms of SARS\u2010CoV and MERS\u2010CoV infections.6, 7 Clinical features of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection showed non\u2010productive cough, dyspnea, myalgia, fever, normal or decreased leukocyte counts, fatigue, and pneumonia. Organ dysfunctions like shock, acute cardiac injury, acute kidney injury, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and death occurs in severe cases. Most of these clinical features of patients had a history of exposure to Huanan seafood whole\u2010sale market. Later on, Chen et al8 documented his findings from 99 pneumonia cases indicated that the 2019\u2010nCoV infection clustered within the group of human close contact and likely to affect older men with comorbidities and results in ARDS. About 46% to 65% of the patients in the intensive care worsened in a short period and died due to respiratory failure.8, 9\nIt is not clear that CoVs are continuously confined to respiratory illness, indeed they additionally invade the central nervous system (CNS) with neurological diseases. Such neuroinvasive tendency of CoVs has been reported in all \u03b2\u2010CoVs, including HCoV\u2010229E,10 SARS\u2010CoV,11 MERS\u2010CoV,12 HCoV\u2010OC43,13 and porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis CoV.14-16 The high resemblance between SARS\u2010CoV and SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 remains to explore whether the potent neuroinvasion of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 plays a significant role in COVID\u201019 infections.4 THE NEUROINVASIVE PROPENSITY OF SARS\u2010CoV\u20102\nSARS\u2010CoV entry into the human host cell is mediated primarily by cellular receptors angiotensin enzyme\u20102 (ACE2) that is expressed in the lung parenchyma, kidney cells, vascular endothelia, small intestine cells, and human airway epithelia.17-19 MERS\u2010CoV enters humans host cells primarily by dipeptidyl peptidase\u20104 (DPP4) in the cells of the immune system, liver, small intestine, and lower respiratory tract.20, 21 Indeed, ACE2 or DPP4 alone is not enough to make the host cell susceptible to infections. SARS\u2010CoV or MERS\u2010CoV infections were also reported in the CNS, where ACE2 or DDP4 expression level is low under normal conditions.22 The accurate route where SARS\u2010CoV and MERS\u2010COV enter CNS is still not clearly documented. Indeed, the lymphatic or hematogenous path seems to be impossible, particularly in the initial infection stage and there were no virus particles were detected in the infected brain area.23-25 However, several shreds of evidence indicate that CoVs may initially invade peripheral nerve terminal, and later to the CNS through a synapse\u2010connected route.14, 16, 26, 27 The trans\u2010synaptic transfer has been reported for HEV67 CoV,9, 15, 16 and avian bronchitis virus.27, 28\nEarlier studies on SARS patient samples have shown the presence of SARS\u2010CoV particles in the brain and located exclusively in the neurons.23, 25 In\u2010vivo experiments using transgenic mice showed that, when SARS\u2010CoV or MERS\u2010COV has given intranasally, it can enter the brain via the olfactory nerve, and quickly spreads to certain specific brain regions like brainstem and thalamus.29, 30 Among the infected brain areas, the brainstem has been heavily infected by SARS\u2010CoV or MERS\u2010CoV.29-31 The brain has expressed ACE2 receptors that have been detected over neurons and glial cells which makes them a potential target of COVID\u201019. Another important observation was those mice infected with MERS\u2010CoV with less inoculum doses, virus particles were not detected in the lung, but only in the brain, which indicates that the CNS infection was more important for the high mortality.30\nPorcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus (PHEV; family Coronaviridae; genus Coronavirus) causes vomiting and encephalomyelitis disease in suckling piglets.32, 33 Earlier studies have shown that the virus is propagated through the neural route and has a potent tropism in the upper respiratory tract.34 HEV 67N CoV is the first coronavirus that showed to invade the porcine brain.30, 35 HEV 67N\u2010infected mice group exhibited typical neurological damage with symptoms of depression, standing/vellicating front claws, and arched waists after 3 days of postinoculation.30 Paraffin\u2010embedded section of the infected mice brain samples showed PHEV positive in the cytoplasm of nerve cell utilizing a mouse anti\u2010PHEV monoclonal antibody by IFA. Antigen\u2010positive neurons were widely distributed in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex in the brain.30 Indeed, the transfer of this CoV to neurons has been manifested by the earlier reports in ultrastructural studies on the clathrin\u2013coat mediated endocytotic or exocytotic pathways.26 Recently, Li et al36, 37 has discussed the neuroinvasive potency of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 that cause respiratory failure in COVID\u201019 patients.\nConsidering all these, the neuroinvasive propensity has been manifested as a common feature of CoVs. Based on more similarity between SARS\u2010CoV and SARS\u2010CoV\u20102, COVID\u201019 may also have a similar potential. Recently, a study carried out by Mao et al38 on COVID\u201019 infected 214 patients found that around 88% of severe patients showed neurological manifestations like acute cerebrovascular disease (impaired consciousness). It is very important to note the fact that, previous reports7, 10, 13 discussed above has documented few SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infected patients showed neurologic symptoms like nausea, headache, and vomiting. However, more convincing evidence for brain illness caused by COVID\u201019 would include type 2 respiratory failure or specific focal neurological defects.39 This should be established by virus detection in cerebrospinal fluid by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or viral culture.5 REMARKS ON THE NEUROINVASIVE PROPENSITY OF SARS\u2010CoV\u20102\nPatients with acute SARS\u2010CoVs infection have shown the presence of the virus in cerebrospinal fluid.30 Baig et al40 have recently published an article where they suggested a putative transcrbrial SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 route to the brain and emphasized that SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 RNA isolation in the cerebrospinal fluid would be the conclusive evidence to report the COVID\u201019 neurovirulence. In SARS patients, the neuromuscular disorder has considered as a critical illness neuropathy and myopathy.41 Besides, more direct evidence has been reported in few countries. A COVID\u201019 case with encephalitis was reported in a male patient (age 56 years) on 16th March 2020 in Beijing Ditan Hospital, Capital Medical University, China (http://www.bjdth.com/html/1/151/163/3665.html). It is very important to note that the PCR amplification showed that the cerebrospinal fluid sample from the patient turned positive for SARS\u2010CoV\u20102.\nAccording to Turtle,39 respiratory failure alone does not indicate CNS invasion by SARS\u2010CoV\u20102. He also considers that several viruses can occasionally gain entry into the human CNS. Nataf42 thinks that an alteration in the dopamine synthetic pathway is possibly involved in the COVID\u201019 pathophysiology. The mechanism implicit in the neurological symptoms is not clear which needs further studies, but the SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 RNA isolation in the cerebrospinal fluid indicates that it might be naturally neuroinvasive in human beings. Since a clear understanding of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 is still missing, a high alert is needed for the possible involvement of CNS in COVID\u201019 patients, despite only a few cases are being documented with encephalitis or meningitis related COVID\u201019. Indeed, the role in the blood\u2010brain barrier comprising the virus and avoiding it for gaining access to the neural tissue needs to be explored further in COVID\u201019 patients. Hence, the possible neuroinvasion may be a guiding significance to treat and prevent COVID\u201019.6 ROUTE OF TRANSMISSION\nThe epidemiological investigation in Wuhan, China has identified the outbreak which was associated with Huanan seafood market, where the majority of patients had visited or worked and subsequently closed for disinfection. Notably, a variety of live wild animals including fish, snakes, badgers, hedgehogs, birds (turtledoves), and animal meat were available in the market before the outbreak began.43 Indeed, as the outbreak started, the main mode of transmission of the infection was from person\u2010to\u2010person. However, understanding of the transmission risks is incomplete. Person\u2010to\u2010person spread of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection is believed to occur mainly via respiratory droplets, corresponding to the spread of the influenza virus. With the droplet transmission, the virus released in the respiratory secretions when an infected person sneezes, coughs, or talks can infect other people if it makes direct contact with the mucous membrane. The infection can also occur when a person touches an infected surface and later touches their nose, mouth or eyes. Droplets usually do not travel more than 2\u2009m and do not linger in the air. However, according to Van et al44 SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 remains for at least 3\u2009hours in aerosols under certain experimental conditions. Taken all these into account, airborne precautions are highly recommended in many countries.7 CLOSING OPINION AND A PATH FORWARD\nThe SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 outbreak has once again spotlighted the need to discover new vaccines, rapid development, and implementation of diagnostic tests against infectious diseases of the global health crisis. Indeed, further studies on COVID\u201019 and its pathogenesis will provide some guidance to deal with this rapidly spreading pandemic infectious disease. Several challenges remain as key areas, including the recent people who have tested COVID\u201019 positive. Can the cured patient be transmitted to others? All these indicate that more detailed criteria are needed for the prevention and control of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 virus and strong rigorous criteria to discharge patients after treatment. It is expected that the differences in the sequence of spike proteins between COVID\u201019 virus and SARS\u2010CoV will enable scientists to identify epitopes in COVID\u201019 virus for the development of monoclonal antibodies against this virus. Basic research studies on SARS\u2010CoV\u20102\u2010host interactions is the key to several unanswered questions in the prevention and control of the disease. Many important questions about the identification and mechanism of interferon antagonists encoded by COVID\u201019 yet to be answered.ACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThe authors thank all the medical healthcare specialists who treated patients during this ongoing pandemic situation across the Globe.

The negative regulatory axis mediated by angiotensin\u2010converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) can antagonize these effects. In the RAS system, the same component can produce opposite physiological effects through different pathways, different components can also be linked by different pathways to have the same physiological effect. This flexibility helps the body respond quickly and coordinately to specific stimuli, from the whole body to a local area and plays an essential role in maintaining homeostasis. This paper will specifically examine the organ protection of ACE2 in the body and discuss its potential role for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID\u201019).\nFigure 1\nOpen in figure viewerPowerPoint\nClassical and counter\u2010regulatory RAS.

ACE2 is active in most tissues and is widely distributed in the heart, kidney, lung, and testis.3, 6 ACE2 is widely present in human alveolar epithelial cells and small intestinal epithelial cells, as well as in arterial and venous endothelial cells and arterial smooth muscle cells. Epidermal basal cell layer of skin and basal layer of the nonkeratinized squamous epithelium of nasal, oral mucosa, and nasopharynx have ACE2 expression. ACE2 is more strongly expressed in type II epithelial cells. Glomerular tubules show ACE2 low, glomerular mesangial and glomerular endothelial cells do not express ACE2, Kupffer cells and hepatocytes, spleen, thymus, lymph nodes, bone marrow, and B and T lymphocytes and macrophages do not show ACE2.7, 8 ACE2 tissue activity is higher than its plasma activity.9 Its activity can not be inhibited by traditional angiotensin\u2010converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs).3 ACE2 has a high affinity for Ang II,10 and its catalytic efficiency for Ang II is 400 times greater than that for Ang I. ACE2 may show differences in different ages and sexes.11, 123 ACE2 AND ACUTE LUNG INJURY, SARS CORONAVIRUS\nLung tissue has high RAS activity and is the leading site of Ang II synthesis. Ang II is an effective pulmonary vasoconstrictor. RAS is activated during hypoxia. Ang II can not only promote the growth response of vascular smooth muscle cells but also directly promote vascular remodeling and prevent pneumonia and shunts related to lung injury.13 However, Ang II can also promote the occurrence of pulmonary edema and impair lung function.14\nAcute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is the most severe form of acute lung injury. It is characterized mainly by increased pulmonary vascular permeability and pulmonary edema. It is often induced by sepsis, aspiration, and pneumonia (including that caused by SARS coronavirus, bird flu, and human influenza viruses). It is a clinical, high\u2010death\u2010rate disease. ACE2 is highly expressed in the lung, and Imai et al14 confirmed the protective effect of ACE2 in acute lung injury. The ACE2 protein in a mouse model induced by inhaled acidic gas was significantly downregulated, while the ACE level remained stable. The inhalation of acidic gas significantly increased the levels of Ang II in the lung and plasma of wild\u2010type mice, and the levels of Ang II in the lung and plasma of acid\u2010induced ACE2 knockout (ACE2 KO) mice were further increased. Recombinant human ACE2 (rhACE2) protein treatment could reduce plasma Ang II levels and reduce acute lung injury in ACE2 KO mice and wild\u2010type mice. A similar phenomenon was observed in a sepsis mouse model. Studies have further demonstrated that Ang II plays a role in acute lung injury via AT1R.\nACE2 is also one of the primary receptors for SARS\u2010CoV invasion into the human body.15 What is puzzling is that SARS\u2010CoV infection leads to highly lethal pneumonia compared with other common cold symptoms after other coronavirus infections. The researchers found that SARS\u2010CoV\u2010infected or recombinant SARS\u2010spike protein\u2010treated wild\u2010type mice exhibited significantly reduced ACE2 expression in the lungs. These mice showed increased severity of pathological conditions in acute lung injury. Treating ACE2 KO mice with SARS\u2010spike protein did not aggravate ARDS symptoms. Therefore, the downregulation of ACE2 expression in SARS\u2010CoV infection may play a causal role in the pathogenesis of SARS, which provides a reasonable explanation for the progression of SARS patients into ARDS. The recent outbreak\u2010causing novel coronavirus pneumonia (COVID\u201019) virus (2019\u2010nCoV, SARS\u2010CoV\u20102) has also been shown to invade human alveolar epithelial cells through mainly ACE2.16 COVID\u201019 ARDS patients and SARS patients have typical ARDS pathology in the lung.17 We believe that SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 and SARS\u2010CoV may share similar pathogenesis and pathological manifestations.4 RISK FACTORS FOR COVID\u201019 PROGNOSIS AND ACE2\nIn the early outbreak of COVID\u201019, epidemiological analyses of 99 patients18 and 138 patients19 showed that the average age of patients was close to 56 years and that the incidence of infections in men was higher than that of infections in women. Nearly half of the cases were complicated by chronic underlying diseases (hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, etc). A retrospective analysis of 52 cases of severely ill patients in Wuhan20 suggested that the severely ill patients were mainly middle\u2010aged and elderly individuals, two\u2010thirds were male, two\u2010thirds developed ARDS, and approximately 40% had underlying diseases. The total 28\u2010day case fatality rate reached 61.5%. Nanshan Zhong et al21 published the data of 1099 COVID patients. The patients in the severe group were older than those in the nonsevere group, and any chronic underlying diseases were more common in the severe group. An analysis of the epidemiological characteristics of the most significant sample volume of 72\u2009314 COVID\u201019 cases22 recently released by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention suggests that deaths occur mainly in patients over 60 years of age, with an increased mortality rate in men than in women and an increased mortality rate in patients with underlying diseases. Combining the results of existing studies, we can conclude that men over 60 years of age with chronic underlying diseases (hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, etc) and secondary ARDS carry risk factors affecting the prognosis of COVID\u201019. Mortality is directly related to these risk factors.\nACE2 plays a vital role in RAS. Ang II promotes atherosclerosis in the cardiovascular system and promotes inflammation, oxidative stress, and migration of endothelial cells and vascular smooth muscle cells.23 ACE2 has a protective effect on many diseases with reduced expression of ACE2, such as hypertension, diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases, because it antagonizes the role of Ang II.1\nRAS activation is an important pathophysiological mechanism of hypertension, and RAS blockers are widely used. Their antihypertensive effect comes from reducing the role of Ang II on the one hand and from the ability of ACEI and AT1R blockers (angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockers [ARBs]) to increase the circulating levels of Ang 1\u20107.24 Studies have shown that the protective mechanism of ACE2 against hypertension is most likely achieved by the degradation of Ang II.25 Studies by Ferrario et al26 and others showed that ACE2 levels increased by 4.7 and 2.8 times when blood pressure decreased after applying ACEIs (lisinopril) and ARBs (losartan) to rats. ACE2 affects not only the development of hypertension but also potentially affects its response to treatment. In RAS\u2010blocked spontaneously hypertensive rats, inhibition of the vascular effects of Ang 1\u20107 may reduce the antihypertensive response to these drugs.24 Animal experiments have found that Ang 1\u20107 infusion treatment can significantly improve vascular endothelial function and inhibit atherosclerotic lesion development in Ang 1\u20107 transgenic apolipoprotein E knockout (ApoE KO) mice receiving atherogenic high\u2010fat diets.27 Studies by Thomas et al28 provided direct evidence for the occurrence and development of ACE2 in atherosclerotic plaques. It was also found that the RAS blockade could prevent atherosclerosis in ApoE/ACE2 double knockout mice. This study provided the basis for ACEI combined with ACE2 treatment to reduce atherosclerosis. ACE2 can also antagonize cardiac fibrosis and ventricular remodeling caused by the long\u2010term effects of Ang II. Wysocki et al,29 Kassiri et al,30 and others provided strong evidence for the direct roles of ACE2 and Ang 1\u20107 in ventricular remodeling expression and regulation. In diabetic nephropathy, downregulation of renal tubular ACE2 is associated with proteinuria and tubular damage,31 and further inhibition of ACE2 aggravates renal damage.32 rhACE2 can reduce blood pressure while reducing renal damage.33\nAs ACE2 provides a pathway for SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 to invade the body, it increases the chance of viral infection. However, ACEIs do not directly affect ACE2 activity. The use of ACEIs to instead increase ACE2 activity has been shown in animal experiments. This mixed\u2010use enhances cardiovascular protection. Therefore, we do not consider it appropriate for patients with COVID\u201019 to discontinue long\u2010term RAS blockers.34, 35 To determine whether ACEI/ARB drugs can be used in patients who lack traditional indications, prospective controlled studies are needed to provide evidence.\nCOVID\u201019 prognosis is related to age and sex. The expression of ACE2 decreases with increasing age. ACE2 expression is higher in young people than in elderly individuals and higher in females than in males.11, 12 This pattern does not match the characteristic of severely ill COVID\u201019 patients being mostly elderly males. We believe that whether the level of ACE2 expression is high or low is not a key factor affecting the prognosis of patients with COVID\u201019. The relationship between sex and prognosis requires additional data to verify.\nThe prognosis of severely ill patients with COVID\u201019 may be related to the decrease in ACE2 activity in elderly patients with chronic underlying diseases. SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection reduces ACE2 activity and receptor consumption, further exacerbating pathophysiological mechanisms, such as Ang II/ACE2 regulation imbalance (showed in Figure 2). There are several potential approaches to address ACE2\u2010mediated COVID\u201019, such as spike protein\u2010based vaccine (rely on the fact that ACE2 is the COVID\u201019 receptor), inhibition of transmembrane protease activity (essential for entry through interaction with ACE2 receptor), blocking ACE2 receptor, and delivering the soluble form of ACE2. Many studies have been conducted to explore the therapeutic potential of ACE2. Most likely the most clinically significant potential is the cardioprotective effect of rhACE2 itself, which has been proven, as it can further enhance the vascular protective effect in patients using ACEI or ARB drugs.1, 36 Forty\u2010four patients37 with ARDS were well tolerated after using rhACE2, and they are most likely to represent the first clinical application in the field of ARDS.\nFigure 2\nOpen in figure viewerPowerPoint\nThe role of ACE2 in organ protection. ACEI, angiotensin\u2010converting enzyme inhibitors; ACE2, angiotensin\u2010converting enzyme 2; Ang II, angiotensin II; ARB, type 1 angiotensin II receptor; ARDS, acute respiratory distress syndrome; ROS, reactive oxygen species5 CONCLUSION\nACE2 is an essential part of the RAS, and it has extensive vascular and organ protection functions in hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and ARDS. Similar to SARS\u2010CoV, SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 also invades the human body through ACE2. According to existing research, men over 60 years old with chronic underlying diseases (hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, etc) and secondary ARDS carry risk factors affecting the prognosis of COVID\u201019. There is currently no effective drug for the treatment of COVID\u201019, and we speculate that ACE2 spike protein\u2010based vaccine and rhACE2 may become one of the most promising approaches for future treatment and improve the prognosis of patients with COVID\u201019.ACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThis study was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (#81870417 to YW) and 13th Five\u2010Year National Science and Technology Major Project (#2018ZX10302206\u2010001\u2010007 to YW, #2017ZX10203202 to G\u2010QW).CONFLICT OF INTERESTS\nThe authors declare that there are no conflict of interests.AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS\nCH wrote the article, including the concept of this article, the definition of intellectual content, and data acquisition.

Further monitoring of the disease prognosis and effective control of the \"relapse\" of the epidemic become the next focus of work. To analyse the clinical prognosis of discharged COVID\u201019 patients by monitoring their SAR\u2010CoV\u20102 nucleic acid status, which may provide evidence to establish discharge standards and follow\u2010up management for COVID\u201019 patients.Methods\nWe included 13 discharged COVID\u201019 patients who were quarantined for 4\u2010week at home. The patient's daily clinical signs were recorded and sputum and faecal specimens were regularly sent for the detection of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 nucleic acid.Results\nThe time between initial symptoms and meeting discharge criteria was 18 \u2013 44 days with an average of 25 \u00b1 6 days. The faecal samples of two patients still tested positive after meeting discharge criteria and the sputum samples of four patients returned positive 5 \u2013 14 days after discharge. The rate of a recurring positive test result in samples from the respiratory system was 31%(4/13).Conclusion\nUnder the present discharge criteria, the high presence of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 nucleic acid in faecal and respiratory samples of discharged COVID\u201019 patients indicate potential infectivity. Therefore, we suggest that faecal virus nucleic acid should be tested as a routine monitoring index for COVID\u201019 and a negative result be added to the criteria. Simultaneously, we should strengthen the regular follow\u2010up of discharged patients with continuous monitoring of the recurrence of viral nucleic acid.\nThis article is protected by copyright.

Therefore, enhancing the management of hospitalized patients is important for preventing and minimizing the further spread of COVID\u201019 during this epidemic. Real\u2010time reverse\u2010transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT\u2010PCR) assay has been widely used to detect SARS\u2010CoV\u20102.2 The Chinese government has also considered RT\u2010PCR result as an indicator of isolation, discharge, or transferring for patients diagnosed with COVID\u201019.3 Notably, the isolation for patients can be revoked, and the patients will be discharged after two consecutive negative RT\u2010PCR tests.3 However, it was reported on February 12, 2020 that five infected patients had initial negative or weakly positive RT\u2010PCR results.4 In another reported case, the third time RT\u2010PCR test result for pharyngeal swab specimen from an infected patient turned to be positive after two previous negative results of the PCR test.5 Here, we investigated 610 patients in one hospital clinically diagnosed with COVID\u201019 according to the chest computed tomography (CT) image during the 2019 novel coronavirus outbreak in Wuhan, China and described the stability issues of RT\u2010PCR testing of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 for them.2 METHODS\nWe retrospectively identified 610 hospitalized patients clinically diagnosed with COVID\u201019 between February 2, 2020, and February 17, 2020, in Hankou Hospital of Wuhan, a hospital designated for the treatment of patients with COVID\u201019. There are 18 doctors and nurses from the Sixth Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat\u2010sen University supporting the hospital.\nAccording to the recommended protocol,3 patients in Wuhan with a chest CT image demonstrates viral pneumonia were clinically diagnosed with COVID\u201019. Confirmed COVID\u201019 was defined according to the positive (do not contain suspicious positive) RT\u2010PCR test result for pharyngeal swab specimens. Patients with COVID\u201019 were defined as critically illed when meeting one of the following criteria: (a) respiratory failure and mechanical ventilation are required, (b) shock, (c) combined with other organ failure and need to transfer to the intensive care unit. RT\u2010PCR test of pharyngeal swab specimen was performed in all patients before admission. For patients with an initial negative, dubious positive or weakly positive RT\u2010PCR result, their pharyngeal swab specimens would be retest after 1 or 2 days. For patients with an initial positive RT\u2010PCR result, their pharyngeal swab specimens would be retest after the patients\u2019 clinical symptoms improved. Both the RT\u2010PCR results and the test dates were recorded and analyzed. This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Wuhan Hankou Hospital. The requirement for informed consent was waived because the patients were part of a public health outbreak investigation.3 RESULTS\nA total of 610 hospitalized patients diagnosed with COVID\u201019 were identified between February 2, 2020, and February 17, 2020. From whom 241 (39.5%) patients were finally confirmed with COVID\u201019 with at least one positive RT\u2010PCR test result. Of all the patients, the median age was 52.7 years (ranging from 20 to 88 years), 55.8% were male, and 56.1% were critically ill. All the patients resided in Wuhan city.\nObservational analysis of RT\u2010PCR results revealed the following findings. In the first test for all patients, 168 cases were positive (27.5%), one was weakly positive (0.2%), 57 were dubious positive (9.3%), and 384 were negative (63.0%) (Figure 1A and Table 1). Among the 384 patients with initial negative results, the second test was performed. For these patients, the test results were positive in 48 cases (12.5%), dubiously positive in 27 patients (7.0%), negative in 280 patients (72.9%), and results were not available for 29 patients (7.6%) (Figure 1B and Table 2). Among the patients with initial non\u2010positive results, seven patients were eventually confirmed with COVID\u201019 by three repeated swab PCR tests, four were confirmed by four repeated tests, and one was confirmed by five repeated tests (Figure 1D and Table 3). In the patients confirmed as COVID\u201019, 17 patients have positive RT\u2010PCR results for pharyngeal swab specimens at first, and their PCR results turned to be negative after treatment for several days. However, again several days later when the patient's symptoms improved, their PCR results returned to be positive (Figure 1D and Table 4). Among them, one patient's RT\u2010PCR result turned positive after two consecutive negative tests (Figure 1D and Table 4). The sub\u2010networks of frequencies and average intervals of resulting transformations are shown in Figure 2. The sub\u2010networks of result transformations were completed before the fourth test, which means negative results may turn to non\u2010negtive (including positive and suspicious positive) results even after three times tests (Figure 2A and Table 5). After the fourth test, no negative case turned to positive, only to suspicious positive. After the fifth test, neither suspicious nor negative results transformed to positive (Figure 2A and Table 5). The RT\u2010PCR tests were implemented in clinic with longer intervals during the positive\u2010suspicious\u2010negative processes than during the negative\u2010suspicious\u2010positive processes (the Wilcoxon rank\u2010sum test: P\u2009=\u20095.706e\u221209) (Figure 2B and Table 6).\nFigure 1\nOpen in figure viewerPowerPoint\nDistribution of real\u2010time reverse\u2010transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT\u2010PCR) test results of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102.

Furthermore, the RT\u2010PCR results showed a fluctuating trend. Theses may be caused by insufficient viral material in the specimen, laboratory error during sampling, or restrictions on sample transportation.6\nTo increase the survival rate of critically ill patients, when respiratory failure, shock, or multiple organ dysfunction syndromes emerged, timely transfer them to ICU or a designated hospital that has sufficient rescue equipments should be considered even if their results of RT\u2010PCR test for pharyngeal swab specimens are negative.\nEighteen patients were found to have a positive RT\u2010PCR result after two consecutive negative results in this study. If these patients were released from isolation due to the previous negative results, the risk of human\u2010to\u2010human transmission would be inevitably increased. Thus, to reduce the number of new cases, strict adherence to the discharge criteria is needed. In addition, it is recommended that patients should be isolated for several days after discharge, to reduce the risk of transmission of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 if the above situation occurs.\nThis study was limited by the lack of detailed patient information because of the clinical workload of the frontline employees involved in the outbreak in Wuhan. Further research is required to investigate the relationship between the RT\u2010PCR result and the onset time of symptoms such as fever.\nOur findings indicate that RT\u2010PCR test results of pharyngeal swab specimens were variable and potentially unstable, and it should not be considered as the only one indicator for diagnosis, treatment, isolation, recovery/discharge and transferring for hospitalized patients clinically diagnosed with COVID\u201019.ACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThe authors thank Dr. Yahan Yang, Meng Yuan, and Haotian Lin for revising the manuscript.

Xia et al tested a total of 60 tears and conjunctival secretions samples from 30 patients, with two samples from each patient collected at an interval of 2 to 3 days. While none of the samples from 29 COVID\u201019 patients without conjunctivitis had detectable SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 RNA, one patient complicated with conjunctivitis showed SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 RNA in the two samples of tears and conjunctival secretions. In the discussion, Xia et al1 mentioned that transmission of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 through conjunctiva is not common, but they also stated that the risk of transmission could not be completely eliminated. However, we consider that transmission of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 through conjunctiva is less likely based on the findings of Xia et al and other documented literature.\nIndeed, ophthalmologists are easily infected with SARS\u2010CoV\u20102, but this does not mean that SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 is transmitted through the conjunctiva. Xia et al1 reasonably explained this issue: close contact with the patients during ophthalmic examinations. Actually, there is almost no distance between ophthalmologists and patients in the examination of the ocular fundus.\nThe positivity of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 RNA in tears and conjunctival secretions of the patient with conjunctivitis does not mean that SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 can replicate in the conjunctiva. Since COVID\u201019 patients have viremia during the acute phase,2 the positivity of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 RNA is likely resulted from the virus in the exudation of conjunctivitis. Despite being a small sample size, undetectability of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 RNA in 29 patients without conjunctivitis supports this explanation. Nevertheless, sufficient sample size and well\u2010characterized studies are required to obtain more evidence.\nIf SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 can be transmitted through the conjunctiva, the initial symptoms should be conjunctivitis. So far, the clinical features of reported COVID\u201019 patients did not have the initial symptoms as conjunctivitis.2-5 Based on the \u201cReport of the WHO\u2010China Joint Mission on Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID\u201019)\u201d summarized from 55\u2009924 laboratory\u2010confirmed cases,6 the typical signs and symptoms include: fever (87.9%), dry cough (67.7%), fatigue (38.1%), sputum production (33.4%), shortness of breath (18.6%), sore throat (13.9%), headache (13.6%), myalgia or arthralgia (14.8%), chills (11.4%), nausea or vomiting (5.0%), nasal congestion (4.8%), diarrhea (3.7%), hemoptysis (0.9%), and conjunctival congestion (0.8%). Overall, only a very small proportion of the patients had conjunctival presentations, which is unknown whether the conjunctival congestion was the initial or coexisted symptom. Thus, SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 is less likely to be transmitted through the conjunctiva.\nIn theory, the premise for transmission through conjunctiva is that SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 can replicate in conjunctival epithelia. SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 is assumed to use angiotensin\u2010converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as the cellular receptor to enter into cells as SARS\u2010CoV.7 Currently it is unknown whether conjunctival epithelia can express ACE2. However, oral, nasal, and nasopharyngeal epithelia do not express ACE2,8 which can explain that most of the COVID\u201019 patients did not have upper respiratory symptoms.2-6 Thus, whether conjunctival epithelia express ACE2 merits further study.\nIt has been proposed that \u201c2019\u2010nCoV transmission through the ocular surface must not be ignored\u201d based on the nosocomial infection of some ophthalmologists and an expert who wore an N95 mask but did not wear anything to protect his eyes was infected with SARS\u2010CoV\u20102.9 However, wearing N95 mask does not mean to completely prevent the transmission. Moreover, the infected expert had conjunctivitis just 2 to 3\u2009hours before he developed fever and catarrhal symptoms,10 rather than several days before the onset of pneumonia.9 It is unlikely that the onset of pneumonia was developed within 2 to 3\u2009hours following the development of conjunctivitis.\nWhile we consider that SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 is less likely transmitted through the conjunctiva, it does not mean that protective goggles are not required in managing COVID\u201019 patients. As eyes and nose are very closely located, the upper edge of a masker is just about one centimeter below the eyes. There is usually a narrow gap underneath the upper edge of a masker because of the uneven surface at nose root, leaving the chance of pathogen exposure. A pair of protective goggles can overcome this problem.\nIn summary, the absence of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 RNA in tears and conjunctival secretions of 29 COVID\u201019 patients without conjunctivitis,1 provides evidence that SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 does not replicate in conjunctival epithelia, which also indicates that SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 is less likely transmitted through the conjunctiva. The detection of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 RNA in tears and conjunctival secretions of the COVID\u201019 patient complicated with conjunctivitis is a coincident event, rather than a causal event of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection of the conjunctiva.CONFLICT OF INTERESTS\nThe authors declare that there are no conflict of interests.", "25830": "1 INTRODUCTION\nThe outbreak of deadly coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID\u201019) which started in late December 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei, China has raised major concerns among academics, researchers, and policymakers on its likely potential effects on the health of the Chinese economy and the world at large. Touted as the second\u2010largest economy in the world with a nominal gross domestic product (GDP) and GDP growth rate of US$13.9 trillion and 6.1%, respectively, as at 2019 (Figure 1)1 and projected to take over the number one spot as the largest economy, it is clear that \u201cwhen China sneezes, the rest of the world catches cold.\u201d\nFigure 1\nOpen in figure viewerPowerPoint\nGrowth rates of the top 10 global economies. Colors represent different years1\nUndisputedly, the COVID\u201019 has immensely dented global economies as shown by indicators from the various market and reports from factories in China and other parts of the world. For instance, the world's largest producer of car parts, Robert Bosch GmbH is reported to have shut down two factories which employed a little over 800 people in Wuhan.2 Honda Motors Co, Ltd, and Nissan Motor Co, Ltd, have also shut down their factory in Wuhan. There has been a fall in global stock prices (Figure 2)3 as well as oil price all due to quarantines, cancelation of flights by many airlines, factories shut down, and so forth. This has reduced demand for oil drastically given that China is the second largest consumer of oil.4 Given the unfortunate spread of COVID\u201019 across the borders of China into other countries, the negative effects have multiplied.\nFigure 2\nOpen in figure viewerPowerPoint\nImpact of coronavirus on the stock markets since its inception. Colors yellow, blue\u2010black, green, and red represent performance of Dow Jones, Nikkei, FTSE, and Shanghai Stock Index, respectively, from January to March 2020.3\nHowever, amidst these woes, China's quest to contain the spread of the disease and ultimately find its cure has resulted in some positive spillovers worth discussing. Section 2 will highlight some positive lights of the COVID\u201019.2 OPPORTUNITIES TO TRY OUT NEWER TECHNOLOGIES AND DEVELOP MANUAL DISTRIBUTION\nCompared to the same period as last year, the lockdown is estimated to have reduced transportation by 50%.5 With mobility greatly affected due to the lockdown, people, therefore, got confined to their rooms making access to basic goods and services a bit difficult. Online services became the alternative for many dwellers, particularly in Wuhan. This alternative also came with some hurdles, as goods ordered took longer than expected to arrive. Moreover, newer policies barred door\u2010to\u2010door delivery services in some communities. Thus, individuals had to pick their ordered items at the community entrance further increasing their chances of contracting the virus. This could be described as inefficiency in the delivery market. Autonomous vehicles (AVs) or self\u2010driving cars provided by companies such as JD and Meitan came in to solve this market failure as it also helps to reduce the spread of the virus. Ordered goods were now loaded unto AVs at specified stations and then delivered to their destination within the communities.6 JD's AVs which operated in Wuhan, for instance, delivered 24 smaller packages of orders per trip at a travel speed of 15\u2009km/h.\nThe identification of symptoms, finding newer treatments, and tracking the spread of the disease became a herculean task for authorities. For instance, some health professionals although in protective gear who came into contact with patients ended up contracting the disease. Artificial intelligence powering futuristic technologies came in to resolve these issues. Interactions made via robots made treatment of sick patients easier, reduced disease transmission, and saved health workers time on simple tasks. Robots were now being used in communicating with isolated patients, disinfecting rooms, taking vital statistics, and delivering medications. In addition, meal delivery robots provided by Keenon Robotics reached people in hospitals and quarantine zones in more than 40 cities.7 People who might be sick or not wearing masks, walking in open spaces were detected and alerted via powerful surveillance technologies, such as facial recognition enabled cameras and drones. Although potentially unreliable, infrared thermometers or thermometer guns increasingly become common in China, where people's temperatures were regularly checked by health workers.8\nSchools and universities in China, for the time being, remain closed indefinitely to minimize the spread of the virus. To reduce the impact of the postponements, online classrooms that enable teachers and professors to conduct online courses from homes such as DingTalk and Tencent Education were launched. Furthermore, online educational platforms such as Liulishuo, Onion Academy, and Zuoyebang currently offer free online classes to students nationwide.3 REDUCING INFORMATION ASYMMETRY\nDuring pandemics, patients belonging to low income and vulnerable groups are mostly at a disadvantage in their quest to seek preventive health services due to the limited information at their disposal. The spread of the COVID\u201019 witnessed health service providers cashing in on the sale of fake cures (vitamin C boosters), face masks, disinfectant wipes, and newly published books on online platforms.9 This also led to price gouging, referring to the practice where prices of goods are hiked up to unreasonably high levels due to the increase in demand. For instance, a 50\u2010piece surgical mask sold on Amazon at \u00a310 early January 2020 shot up to \u00a3170 a few weeks later as the virus spread heightened (ibid). The World Health Organization (WHO) expressing concerns about some of this misleading information especially on Amazon helped rectify this anomaly. A million products with the claim of protecting patients against the coronavirus or even curing it have now been banned on Amazon. Furthermore, tens of thousands of overpriced health products from unscrupulous sellers have also been removed from the platform.\nAside from WHO and the various departments of health raising awareness via traditional media, many companies are offering new tools to share reliable information and counteract myths especially in this age where fake news, rumors, and misinformation travel faster than pathogens. For example, a map layer has been created on top of Baidu's Map App that indicates real\u2010time locations of confirmed and suspected cases of the virus.10 A platform created by Qihoo 360 now provides information about the health status of travelers boarding trains or planes. New entries on the relevant symptoms, medical treatments, and preventive measures are currently updated on Medipedia, a health care encyclopedia, and are edited and reviewed by renowned medical experts. JiaoZhen a myth\u2010busting platform is also in place to aid users to discern fact from myth.114 DECLINE IN POLLUTION\nThe lockdown coupled with the extension of the Chinese New Year prolonged production slowed business activities and restricted transportation. This move is argued to be a contributing factor to China's economic slowdown as the affected provinces serves as major manufacturing hubs for the country.12 However, current satellite images show a dramatic decline in pollution levels over China as indicated by (Figure 3).13 Maps from NASA indicate of falling levels in nitrogen dioxide (NO2) compared to the first 2 months of 2019.13 Although a similar trend was observed during the 2008 economic recession this current rate is estimated to have happened at a very faster rate and have lasted long. Longer exposures to elevated concentrations of NO2 is argued to potentially increase susceptibility to respiratory infections.14 The chances of individuals contracting the respiratory infection are limited in this instance especially when such symptoms are exhibited when one contracts the virus.\nFigure 3\nOpen in figure viewerPowerPoint\nNitrogen levels before and during the pandemic in China. The colors represent the various mean tropospheric NO2 densities between periods135 SUBSIDIES/TRANSFER PAYMENTS/EXEMPTIONS\nThe applied strategies so as to contain and control the spread of the virus during the Lunar New Year holidays brought some losses to businesses. The central government via the provincial governments in their quest to revive businesses have responded by promising tax breaks, exemptions, and subsidies to affected firms. These measures have been rolled out in a number of regions and cities that have been hardly hit by the disease. Notable among these provinces include the capital Beijing, Shanghai, Hubei, Guangdong, Suzhou, Shandong, Qingdao, Chongqing, Hunan, Sichuan, Liaoning, and Fujian.15 It is worthy to note that these policies are mostly applicable to micro\u2010, small\u2010, and medium\u2010sized enterprises as well as foreign businesses registered in line with the standard for classification of Small and Micro Enterprises (SMEs).\nAccording to the China Briefing News portal, these measures comprise of preferential policies aimed at reviving and sustaining the business operations of SMEs, including reliefs on taxation, finance, social security, subsidies, and rent reduction. Notable measures which cut across this policy include: reducing rents for SMEs, waiving of administrative fees (special equipment fee, sewage treatment fee, and road occupation fee) for SMEs; subsidizing research and development cost for SMEs of up to RMB 200\u2009000 (US$ 28\u2009700) as well increasing financial support for SMEs. Refunding unemployment insurance premiums, offering social insurance subsidies for SMEs, subsidies for employee training, the purchase of teleworking service products, and the extension period for the payment of social insurance premiums to the end of March. Others include the lowering of lending rates, whiles local banks are being encouraged to adjust loan repayment, extend maturity periods, or renew the loan without repayment for firms in heavily hit zones. In the case of exemptions, SMEs seriously affected by the epidemic and lease state\u2010owned assets are exempted from paying the first month's rent, and either halving or paying zero rents in the next 2 months. In all of these measures, it is instructive to note that some are specific to some regions as they are time\u2010bound and thus required to be adhered to to smoothen the production and operations of the affected SMEs and other businesses (ibid).\nIn the area of e\u2010commerce, Alibaba\u2010backed internet bank MyBank claimed that interest on loans would be slashed for 1.5 million shops and 300\u2009000 pharmaceutical shops in Hubei. Meituan Dianping, an online food delivery and ticketing services platform has also exempted all take\u2010out businesses in Wuhan for a month's commission. Huazhu Group, one of China's largest hotel operators, is also purported to have halved all franchise fees for its subsidiary hotels nationwide for 2 months starting February, whereas areas in Hubei would be waived for the entire period.16\nOf course, the COVID\u201019 has stamped its foot on China's economy and the world's at large. It is also expected to last far longer and spread to other parts of the world. The steps and strategies undertaken in China in curbing this situation form a blueprint for other affected areas to emulate. Some of the methods and ways of handling diseases or outbreaks as the global crisis plays out may very well become standard operating procedures in the decade that awaits.CONFLICT OF INTERESTS\nThe authors declare that there are no conflict of interests.", "25802": "", "25771": "The sudden outbreak and spread of COVID\u201019 in this spring led to a serious challenge to the global public health system. So far, the number of cases in the mainland of China has exceeded 80\u2009000, more than 3000 people died of this disease. The latest data showed that in addition to China's neighboring countries like Japan, South Korea, Thailand and India, severe outbreaks have also occurred in Italy and many other countries around the world. As dated on 12th March, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared that the confirmed cases reported outside China rise to more than 30\u2009000. WHO had announced that \u201cthis is not a drill, it's a global pandemic.\u201d\nThe special expert group for control of the epidemic of novel coronavirus pneumonia of the Chinese Preventive Medicine Association has recently reported the epidemiological characteristics of these cases.1 The results showed that the cases were concentrated in the age group of 30 to 79 years old, which accounted for more than 85% of the total number of confirmed cases, and the number of cases above 60 years old accounted for 30% to 45%. The crude death rate was 2.3% in all cases, 14.8% in the age group over 80 years old, 2.8% in men, and 1.7% in women, unfortunately, and sadly, more than 3000 Chinese medical staff have been infected. While no epidemiological data on the prevalence and proportion of severe cases in pregnant women have been reported till now.1 MORE DATA AND EXPERIENCE NEED TO BE COLLECTED IN LATE PREGNANCY\nThe latest research \u201cClinical characteristics and intrauterine vertical transmission potential of COVID\u201019 infection in nine pregnant women\u201d in the Lancet reported by Huijun et al2 provided very important information about COVID\u201019 infection in pregnant women. Nasopharyngeal swab samples of neonate and mother were collected, and the amniotic fluid, cord blood, and breast milk samples for the presence of COVID\u201019 were also tested, the aim is to provide an assessment of the vertical transmission potential of COVID\u201019 infection. Although the study analyzed only nine cases pregnant women with confirmed COVID\u201019 pneumonia, and the presence of replicable viruses in the blood of pregnant women was not confirmed, under the emergent circumstances and the limitation of detection methods, these findings are helpful for preventive and clinical practice in China and the world. The article concluded that there is no evidence for intrauterine infection caused by vertical transmission in women who develop COVID\u201019 pneumonia in late pregnancy, and the clinical characteristics of pregnant women are basically the same as that of ordinary adults. While this conclusion may not be convincing because of the small number of cases, in addition, gestational age at the time of infection and the mode of delivery may affect the prognosis. All the nine cases of pregnancy included in this study were in the third trimester of pregnancy, gestational ages on admission were over 36 weeks and C\u2010sections were adopted, the results in fact revealed the necessity and effectiveness about taking reasonable measures in the early stage of COVID\u201019 infection, even in pregnancy. More data and experience is still needed to be collected for confirming the transmission and clinical characteristics of pregnancy.2 STANDARD MONITORING AND FOLLOW\u2010UP ARE NEEDED IN EARLY AND MIDDLE PREGNANCY\nAlthough limited studies suggested that COVID\u201019 infection has no specific effect on late pregnancy, however, the first or second\u2010trimester pregnancy deserves more attention. At different stages of pregnancy, the hormone level and immune status of pregnant women are totally different, which is bound to be closely related to the outcome of infection. In the early pregnancy, the normal immune balance of the mother is challenged by foreign fetal antigens,3 which may appear unstable state. This state will tend to be stable with the gradual adaptation of the mother. With the growth of the fetus, the mother's immune system is constantly adjusting this steadily, so that it can finally reach a good balance in the late pregnancy. Therefore, the maternal immune system in early pregnancy is actually very sensitive, and the fetus is also in an important stage of organ development. External stimulation, especially virus infections (such as rubella virus, cytomegalovirus, and herpes simplex virus), may cause serious immune system disorder and internal environment imbalance, which probably lead to disease, abortion for mother or abnormal growth and development for fetus.4 Previous studies have confirmed that the pandemic of viral infection, like H1N1 2009 influenza virus infection5 or SARS 2003,6 was related to the high incidence of maternal and infant complications, such as spontaneous abortion, premature delivery, intrauterine growth restriction, tracheal intubation, admission to intensive care unit, renal failure, and disseminated intravascular coagulation. It is time to predict that these consequences may have happened during the outbreak or may not have been discovered long after the outbreak. It is very necessary to investigate COVID\u201019 infection in the first and second trimester of pregnancy and keep follow\u2010up, these procedures/testing should be started from now and continued till the end of the epidemic for at least 1 year, or even longer. National Health Commission of China launched a new notice on 8 February 2020 about strengthening maternal disease treatment and safe midwifery during the prevention and control of new coronavirus pneumonia.7 However, there is no recommendation for routine detection and monitoring of early and midterm pregnancy. Given the widespread and a large number of asymptomatic patients with COVID\u201019 infection, such follow ups may need to be further strengthened.3 PREGNANT MEDICAL STAFF SHOULD BE SUPPORTED BY POLICY\nIt is worth noting that women in late pregnancy with \u201ca clumsy figure\u201d are usually valued and well protected, while those in early pregnancy are often neglected because of their \u201cnormal figure and flexible movement.\u201d Being medical staff (especially in China), pregnancy maybe never the reason for them to be free from work. In the current severe epidemic situation, many \u201cexpectant mothers\u201d in my colleagues still stick to work in their positions, some of them even work in fever clinics and isolation wards, they deserve to be taken care of and supported by policies. Routine COVID\u201019 testing, adequate rest, and better follow\u2010up should be reflected in the policy.4 SUMMARY\nAs time goes by, no doubt we will have a better understanding of 2019\u2010nCoV infections, while routine detection and monitoring of COVID\u201019 in pregnancy should be considered, standard design, clinical trials, and implementation of future COVID\u201019 vaccines for pregnant women also recommended.8 We hope that human beings can exchange the most experience with the least cost.CONFLICT OF INTERESTS\nThe authors declare that there are no conflict of interests.", "25721": "In December 2019 2019, a cluster of acute respiratory illness occurred in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China. This disease is now officially known as 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID\u201019) from World Health Organization, novel coronavirus pneumonia from Chinese Health Authorities, or SARS 2.0 from group discussions, caused by SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 or 2019 nCoV.1 Up to 15 February 2020, 66\u2009581 cases have been confirmed along with 8969 suspected cases in the country and 37\u2009914 confirmed cases in Wuhan. Internationally, cases have been reported in 24 countries and 5 continents. On 12 February, a sudden spike in new cases with COVID\u201019 (15\u2009152 new cases) was due to changed diagnosis method according to the fifth edition of guidance,2 combination of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 nucleic acid test and clinical COVID\u201019 features.\nQuantitative real\u2010time reverse transcriptase\u2010polymerase chain reaction (RT\u2010qPCR) assay has routinely been used for the detection of causative viruses from respiratory secretions and final pathogenic diagnostics of COVID\u201019. More than seven types of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 nucleic acid test kit have been developed and approved rapidly, while a large number of the \u201csuspected\u201d cases with typical clinical COVID\u201019 features and identical specific computed tomography (CT) images were not diagnosed. Unfortunately, due to an overwhelming situation in local hospitals, many \u201csuspected\u201d cases and diagnosed cases cannot efficiently be separated or treated. Recently, one patient was not confirmed by RT\u2010qPCR testing for SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection for the first three times within 3 weeks before bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) was acquired, results from both RT\u2010qPCR and next\u2010generation sequencing (NGS) testing were positive for SRAS\u2010CoV\u20102. These largely affected efficiency to control viral spreading and outbreak. Indeed, several factors have been proposed to explain the inconsistency or the high false\u2010negative rate (FNR).3 For example, results from RT\u2010qPCR testing using primers in the ORF1ab gene and N genes can be affected by the variation of viral RNA sequences. In terms of the natural history of the disease and viral load in different anatomic sites of the patients, sampling procedures largely contribute to high FNR. By estimate, FNR from one\u2010time testing was as high as 30% to 50% in real COVID\u201019 cases.\nIt is urgent to rapidly optimize the quality of testing kit and standard operating procedure for the best testing of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection. Based on the sequence analysis of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 and ACE2 as a viral receptor, we urgently recommend that samples from the lower respiratory tract of the patients, including sputum and BALF, should be used for testing viral infection although nasopharyngeal swab is more commonly used and easier. Other factors or methods we should consider to further decrease high FNR include sample reagents (for example, TRIzol has been proved for the stability of RNA samples and can inactivate viruses), sample transport condition, and laboratory practice standard. Lastly, developing serum\u2010based testing methods, for example, detection of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102\u2010specific immunoglobulin M from patients\u2019 sera.\nUnlike SARS\u2010CoV and MERS\u2010CoV, SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 is spreading faster, initially, COVID\u201019 may present without symptoms, or develop into fever, coughing, shortness of breath, pain in the muscles, and tiredness. As the SARS outbreak in 2003, some cases with COVID\u201019 may also develop into pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome, which contributed about 9% of death from the patients with severe conditions. Previous studies have tested sensitivity and specificity for clinical diagnosis of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS).3, 4 The study showed a sensitivity of 0.96 and a specificity of 0.96 for SARS clinical diagnosis based on the SARS disease course.3 In the fifth edition of diagnosis and treatment of COVID\u201019,5 clinical diagnosis was proposed for the first time. This method has been used to define cases in Hubei province which have epidemiology history, clinical features (fever and/or respiratory symptoms, early onset of normal/decreased white blood cell count or decreased lymphocyte count) along with sign of pneumonia on chest CT scan/X\u2010ray. As described in a latest preprint article with a large number of cases (1099 cases) with COVID\u201019, the most common clinical and radiographic features were summarized from a large number of cases with COVID\u201019.6 Fever and cough were the most common symptoms, lymphopenia was very common on admission, severe cases appeared to have more prominent laboratory abnormalities. The most common patterns (76.4%) on chest CT were ground\u2010glass opacity and bilateral patchy shadowing. The study also disclosed a case with a 24\u2010day incubation period for the first time, which was claimed as a unique case by one of the coauthor.6 These CT patterns have been found in many \u201csuspected\u201d cases with negative testing of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 viral RNA in hospitals in Wuhan, China.\nAs we learn more about SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 and COVID\u201019, we began to realize the deficiency in the diagnosis based on sole detection of viral nucleic acid, diagnosis with a combination of RT\u2010qPCR or NGS testing and clinical criteria may be more important for the management of the current outbreak in China, especially in Wuhan. Since the Chinese government launched an urgent policy for all diagnosed patients with COVID\u201019, there is no cost for all treatments from the COVID\u201019. This change would significantly facilitate sufficient management of the SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 outbreak in Wuhan, especially increase patient compliance for quarantine and treatments.CONFLICT OF INTERESTS\nThe authors declare that there are no conflict of interests.AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS\nYW and HK contributed equally to this study. Conception or design of the work: YW, HK, and ZT; data collection: YW and HK; drafting the article: YW and HK; critical revision of the article: ZT and XL; final approval: YW, HK, XL, and ZT.", "25829": "We have read with interest the paper by Li et al1 about the neurotropism of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS\u2010CoV\u20102), responsible of coronavirus disease (COVID\u201019), recently discovered in China and now worldwide spread. In particular, the paper focuses on the role of the nervous system involvement in causing the respiratory failure. The authors take into consideration the biological similarities of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 with two coronaviruses, which globally impacted the recent history: SARS\u2010CoV, discovered in 2002 and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS\u2010CoV), discovered in 2012.1, 2 Even if the role of neuroinvasion in COVID\u201019 severity still remains undefined, the authors correctly underline its important implications. In particular, the treatment options should contemplate this potential trait of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102, for example, considering the obstacle of blood\u2010brain barrier or limiting the use of corticosteroids.1 The message conveyed by the authors is extremely important and induces specific reflections about COVID\u201019 management. The lone possibility of the relationship between respiratory failure and neuroinvasion of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 should encourage strict clinical monitoring of the patients and research works aimed to clarify the features of this disease.\nFrom a long\u2010term perspective, the alert expressed by Li et al1 is important for the treatment in postacute phase. In fact, after the clinical stabilization and, hopefully, virus eradication by the use of proper drugs, functional restoration should be the main goal.3 Indeed, the disease can be very severe and its long\u2010term bio\u2010psycho\u2010social consequences potentially very serious.4 In this sense, rehabilitation may play a relevant role for the management of postacute COVID\u201019. This role is not only limited to the design of specific programs, mainly based on physical exercises for respiratory improvement, but should also consider a continuous and global control of functions. In addition, the aforementioned neuroinvasive potential of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102, as expressed in the conclusions of the work by Li et al,1 represents an insidious danger. This makes the follow\u2010up of patient's functional condition essential and the contribution of rehabilitation determinant. Furthermore, it implies adaptations of specific rehabilitation programs: if the pulmonary damage is associated with neurological impairment, the programs usually developed for pure respiratory diseases could not be enough for patient's recovery.5 The rehabilitation approach can be independent of the setting: hospital, intensive care unit (ICU), and home.6 Actually, rehabilitation in ICU, besides the mentioned improvement of the deficits directly determined by the virus\u2010related damages, should prevent secondary impairments, due to immobilization syndrome, and, for example, critical illness of neuropathy and myopathy.7 This issue is fundamental, especially if associated with the neurotropism of the coronaviruses. Even at home, for patients in compulsory or spontaneous quarantine, rehabilitation management can provide indicative parameters of the multisystem function. By the use of simple self\u2010administrable exams, like Borg scale for perceived exertion or 6\u2010minute\u2010walking test, the subject can check his/her status.6 These evaluations can reveal impairments in apparently asymptomatic patients and indicate the necessity of further medical assessments for an early diagnosis. In addition, for convalescent patients at home, rehabilitation programs should be developed for a rapid functional restoration and for a continuous monitoring.3 This tactics should be supported by telerehabilitation systems, based on electronic applications, able to make efficient the communication between patients, caregivers, and healthcare professionals, without the direct contact.8 Hence, rehabilitation enlarges its usual field of action, representing a model for secondary and tertiary prevention, and can be a potential aid in the control of COVID\u201019 diffusion.\nTo evaluate the impact of rehabilitation in the severe coronavirus diseases, we have started from the analysis by Li et al,1 who considered SARS\u2010CoV and MERS\u2010CoV. We have searched on PubMed the papers about these viruses, considering a 5\u2010year\u2010period time since the discovery of each virus. Then, we have calculated the percentages of the papers about \u201cnervous system,\u201d \u201crehabilitation,\u201d and \u201cneuroinvasive,\u201d respect to the total number of papers about a particular virus. The same analysis was performed for the SARS\u2010CoV\u20102, but just for the time period 2019 to 2020 (Figure 1). Interestingly, the percentage of papers about \u201cnervous system\u201d and \u201cneuroinvasive\u201d is higher in MERS\u2010CoV, in comparison with SARS\u2010CoV. Probably, after the discovery the 2002 coronavirus, the interest about the neurotropism of this kind of viruses increased. Another interesting result is the notable high percentage of papers about \u201crehabilitation\u201d for SARS\u2010CoV\u20102. The data, although partial, could support the importance of rehabilitation in the supervision and treatment of acute infections and open the doors for further research works about this topic.\nFigure 1\nOpen in figure viewerPowerPoint\nIn the left panel, a schematic representation of the timeline indicating the year of discovery of the three viruses considered in the paper.

This is a concern, as the study by Guan et al is twice as large as all the other studies reporting fatality rates combined, and would significantly reduce the overall pooled fatality rate.", "25898": "1 INTRODUCTION\nCoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID\u201019) has been declared a global pandemic by WHO.1, 2 However, we have limited therapeutic options.2, 3 With the rising toll of infected populations and rising number of deaths, the preferential global concern is the development of safe and effective therapeutics against COVID\u201019. Although lopinavir/ritonavir was initially a first\u2010line agent in the management of the disease, a study conducted by Cao et al4 compared lopinavir\u2010ritonavir with the standard of care and no benefit was observed in the primary endpoint.\nHowever, at the same time chloroquine (CQ) emerged as a potent inhibitor of severe acute respiratory syndrome\u2010coronavirus\u20102 (SARS\u2010CoV\u20102) in vitro.5 In SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infected Vero\u2010E6 cell lines, low\u2010micro molar concentration of CQ inhibited virus infection (EC50\u2009=\u20091.13\u2009\u03bcM) with high selectivity index (SI\u2009>\u200988.50).5 CQ increases endosomal pH and also alters glycosylation of angiotensin\u2010converting enzyme 2 receptors, thus altering the pathogenesis in vitro.6-8 Besides, CQ also has immunomodulatory activity5 and enhances the activity of regulatory T cells.9 Beneficial effect of CQ came to light in recent clinical studies also. In a randomized clinical trial, CQ (n\u2009=\u200910 patients) performed better than lopinavir\u2010ritonavir (n\u2009=\u200912) combination10 any may represent an effective and in\u2010expensive option. However, CQ is one of the major treatment options against malaria and overuse may lead to resistance. Again the toxicity profile of CQ is also a major concern.11\nHydroxychloroquine (HCQ), being a less toxic derivative, came to the limelight soon.12 One group found CQ to be more potent than HCQ,12 however, another research group found HCQ to be more potent.13 In the study by Yao et al,13 the EC50 to inhibit the virus in SARS\u2010CoV infected Vero cells was 0.72\u2009\u00b5M13 and using a physiologically based pharmacokinetic modelling model, they established that this concentration can be attained by a loading dose of HCQ 400\u2009mg BD on the first day, followed by 200\u2009mg BD for SARS\u2010CoV\u20102.13 Following these findings many clinical trial started worldwide, comparing HCQ to other treatment regimes, however, until now the results of only seven studies are reported. In this regard, we have conducted the first systematic review and meta\u2010analysis to evaluate the efficacy and safety of HCQ in clinical settings.2 MATERIALS AND METHODS\nThis systematic review was done according to the fundamentals laid in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions14 and described as stated by Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta\u2010Analysis (PRISMA) statement.15\nObjective: To evaluate the safety and efficacy of hydroxychloroquine in the treatment of patients with COVID\u201019.\n2.1 Criteria for including studies in this review\nSetting: In the systematic review part of the study, we included case series, single\u2010group prospective observational/interventional studies, other observational study designs and randomized controlled trials (RCTs). However, in the meta\u2010analysis part of the study, only comparative clinical studies (both prospective and retrospective observational studies) and RCTs were included.\nParticipants: Patients with lab\u2010confirmed COVOID\u201019 of any age were included.\nIntervention: Hydroxychloroquine.\nControl: Standard/conventional therapy.\nObjectives:\n1.\nClinical cure (time to body temperature normalization and time to cough relief).\n2.\nVirological cure on day 6 to 7 postinitiation of therapy.\n3.\nDeath or clinical worsening of disease condition during treatment.\n4.\nRadiological progression during drug treatment.\n5.\nRecurrence of infection during treatment.\n6.\nSafety and tolerability of HCQ.\nComparisons:\nA.\nHCQ vs conventional therapy/control.\nB.\nHCQ in combination of other agents vs conventional therapy/control.\nDefinitions:\n1.\nClinical recovery:\nTime to clinical recovery is calculated in terms of time to normalization of body temperature and total no of cough days.16 The clinical cure parameters are important as one of the patient, who became polymerase chain reaction (PCR) negative following therapy, still died of the disease in the study by Gautret et al17 and another in India.18\n2.\nVirological cure: Nondetection of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 in nasopharyngeal swab.17\n3.\nRecurrence of infection: Defined as swab becoming negative for SARS\u2010CoV\u20102, which is again becoming positive after some days.17\nSearch strategy:\nElectronic searches: We searched a total of 16 literature databases (Pubmed, CINAHL, SCOPUS, OVID, Wiley online library, Web of Science, Cochrane CENTRAL, Embase, medRxiv and bioRxiv, Trip Database, Nature, Epistemonikos, Science Direct, Virtual Health Library; Pan American Health Organization, CNKI, and mediterranee\u2010infection.com/pre\u2010prints\u2010ihu) from the date of genesis to the 8th April 2020. Reference list of all identified articles was screened to find out more relevant articles. There were no language restrictions. The search keywords included 2019\u2010nCoV, 2019 novel coronavirus, COVID\u201019, coronavirus disease 2019, chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, Plaquenil, hydroxychloroquine sulfate, and hydroxychloroquine sulfate. Details of the search strategy of each of the databases are represented in Table S1.\n2.2 Selection of studies\nAfter a search of databases and removal of duplicates, two authors (HK and HRDK) independently screened the titles/abstracts using the selection criteria. For relevant articles, full texts were obtained for further evaluation. In case of any discrepancy PS and BM were consulted and the issue was resolved.\n2.2.1 Data extraction\nData extraction was done separately by two authors (PS and HRDK) using pretested data extraction forms following the template provided by the Cochrane data extraction form. In articles published in a language other than English, Google translate was used to identify relevant data.\n2.2.2 Risk of bias evaluation of included studies\nFor RCTs, we used the Cochrane risk of bias tool for randomized controlled studies.14 In the case of nonrandomized interventional studies, we used ROBINS\u2010I tool.19 In the case of observational studies, Newcastle Ottawa Scale was used.20 Three investigators (DM, HRDK, and PS) separately evaluated the possibility of bias using these tools. Publication bias was not evaluated by funnel plot as there was only three studies which were included in the meta\u2010analysis part of the study.21\n2.3 Assessment of heterogeneity\nStatistical heterogeneity was evaluated by \u03c72 test and I2statistics.14 An I2 value of 0\u2009<\u200940% is not considered as significant, 30% to 60% is taken as moderate heterogeneity, 50% to 90% considered as substantial heterogeneity, and 75% to 100% is considered as significant heterogeneity.\n2.3.1 Statistical analysis\nAs all the data were dichotomous data, we used either odds ratio (OR) or risk ratio (RR) as appropriate for estimating the point estimate along with 95% confidence interval (CI). In the absence of significant clinical heterogeneity, we have performed the meta\u2010analysis using the Mantel Hazel method or inverse variance method for dichotomous data and continuous data respectively. When statistical heterogeneity was low to moderate, we used a fixed\u2010effect model for pooling of data otherwise, the random\u2010effects model was applied.143 RESULT\nWe screened a total of 16 literature databases and identified 278 nonduplicate articles, which were evaluated for possible inclusion using title and abstract. Out of these, 25 articles were selected for full\u2010text screening and finally, seven articles (total participants\u2009=\u20091358) were included in the systematic review and three articles were included in the meta\u2010analysis. About 18 articles were excluded following full\u2010text screening (reasons: editorial\u2009=\u20093, review\u2009=\u20095, expert consensus/recommendation\u2009=\u20093, chloroquine\u2009=\u20093, in vitro\u2009=\u20092, in\u2010silico\u2009=\u20091, and kinetic study\u2009=\u20091).

In the study by Jun et al,25 time to normalization (median and range) of body temperature was 1 (0\u20103) days in the HCQ group, while in the control group it was 1 (0\u20102) days. In the study by Zhaowei et al,16 treatment with HCQ resulted in significantly less time for normalization of body temperature (2.2\u2009\u00b1\u20090.4 days) compared with the control group (3.2\u2009\u00b1\u20091.3 days).16\nb.\nDuration of cough\nA single study by Zhaowei et al,16 the number of cough days was significantly lower in the HCQ group (2.0\u2009\u00b1\u20090.2 days) compared to the control group (3.1\u2009\u00b1\u20091.5 day).\n2.\nHCQ vs control: Virological cure at day 6 to 7 postinitiation of therapy:\nBoth the studies reported virological cure (n\u2009=\u200929 in HCQ alone arm vs n\u2009=\u200931 in control arm) on day 6 to 7. No difference was observed between the two arms in terms of virological cure (OR of virological cure 2.37; 95% CI, [0.13\u201044.53]). As there was high heterogeneity (I2\u2009=\u200972%), we used the random\u2010effect model. Data showed in Figure 2.\n3.\nHCQ vs control: Death or clinical worsening of disease/progression to severe disease (LOCF model):\nAll the three studies (n\u2009=\u200966 in HCQ alone arm and n\u2009=\u200962 in the control arm) reported death or clinical worsening of disease despite treatment with the designated interventions. In the study by Gautret et al,24 a total of 20 patients were given HCQ alone (out of which six lost to follow\u2010up). In the analysis, we used the last observation carried forward (LOCF) model for analysis. In case the patient required intensive care unit (ICU) during treatment, it was considered worsening of a clinical condition.\nIn terms of death or clinical worsening of disease (composite), no difference was seen between the two arms with OR, 1.37 (95% CI, 0.09\u201021.97). As there was moderate heterogeneity (I2\u2009=\u200959%), we used random\u2010effect model. Data showed in Figure 3.\n4.\nHCQ vs control: Radiological progression during treatment:\nIn terms of CT evidence of radiological progression of pneumonia/lung damage (n\u2009=\u200946 both the HCQ group and control/standard treatment group), treatment with HCQ resulted in a significant decrease in the radiological progression with OR, 0.31; 95% CI, (0.11\u20100.9). As the heterogeneity among the studies was low (I2\u2009=\u200916%), we used the fixed\u2010effect model. Data showed in Figure 4.\n5.\nHCQ vs control: Recurrence (PCR negativity initially during treatment, which is followed by recurrence of PCR positivity) of infection during treatment:\nIn the study by Gautret et al,24 one patient who was on both HCQ and azithromycin (Azi) tested negative on day 6 post inclusion, however, he became PCR positive gain on day 8 post inclusion.17\n6.\nHCQ vs control: Safety:\nFigure 2\nOpen in figure viewerPowerPoint\nVirological cure (HCQ vs control/conventional treatment).

On the other hand, in the standard treatment group, three adverse events were reported (n\u2009=\u200962). In the study by Jun et al,25 four cases (26.7%) of the HCQ group and 3 cases (20%) of the control group had transient diarrhea and abnormal liver function. In the study by Zhaowei et al,16 two patients in the HCQ arm showed mild adverse reactions, one patient developed a rash, and one patient experienced headache. In the study by Gautret et al,17 one patient stopped treatment on day 3 due to nausea and one case of death in the HCQ arm (as there was no information regarding the details of the death case, the authors did not include it as adverse effect). However, when the results were combined, no significant difference was seen between the two arms with regard to the occurrence of adverse effects (OR, 2.19; 95% CI, [0.59\u20108.18]). As there was very low heterogeneity (I2\u2009=\u20090%), we used the fixed\u2010effect model (data shown in Figure 5).\nFigure 5\nOpen in figure viewerPowerPoint\nSafety issues (HCQ vs control/conventional treatment). CI, confidendence of interval; HCQ, hydroxychloroquine\n3.2.1 Sensitivity analysis\nAs there is a huge criticism28 about the first study on HCQ by Gautret et al,17 and the high risk of bias of the study, we conducted a sensitivity analysis and conducted the same set of analysis as mentioned above by removing the study data of Gautret et al17 from the analysis. However, irrespective of removal of the study, the study conclusions did not change in terms of virological cure on day 6 to 7 postinitiation of therapy, death or clinical worsening of disease/progression to severe disease, the radiological progression of lung disease during treatment and safety. The details of the sensitivity analysis are illustrated in Figure S2 to S4. After removing the first study by Gautret et al,17 also, in meta\u2010analysis part of the study, a benefit was seen only in terms of radiological progression of lung disease during treatment with comparable safety to the control/conventional treatment.\n3.3 Comparision 2: HCQ along in combination with other agents vs control/standard therapy\nA total of four studies evaluated efficacy of HCQ\u2009+\u2009Azi17, 23, 24, 26 and five studies17, 22, 24, 26 evaluated safety of the combination. Among these two studies were by Gautret et al17 and the population of patients in the first study was also part of the second study.\nComing to the efficacy of the combination in patients with COVID\u201019, in the first study by Gautret et al,17 the use of HCQ\u2009+\u2009Azi (n\u2009=\u20096) combination resulted in 100% virological cure, compared with 57.1% virological cure in the HCQ alone arm (n\u2009=\u200914) and 12.5% virological cure in the control arm (n\u2009=\u200916). However detailed safety data is not available for the same. In the second single arm study by the same authors with a higher sample size (n\u2009=\u200980 COVID\u201019 cases), a virological cure was seen in 83% of patients on day 7 and in 93% of patients on day 8. At the time of publishing the study report, 65 patients were discharged from the hospital with a mean length of hospital stay of 4.6 days.24 In another report by the same group (n\u2009=\u20091061), the virological cure was seen in 91.7% of participants by day 10 and poor outcome was seen in only 4.3% patients with a mortality rate of 0.47%.23 On the other hand, another published single\u2010group prospective study,26 which evaluated the efficacy of the same combination at the same dose did not find significant efficacy of the combination in terms of virological cure (8 out of 10 positive for the virus at 5\u20106 days after therapy). Among the 11 patients enrolled, one patient died, two needed ICU. However, the patient population was of severe COVID\u201019 with significant comorbidities present in eight cases out of 11.\nComing to the safety profile of the combination, In the second study by Gautret et al,24 the reported adverse effects of the combination treatment were nausea and vomiting (2.5%), diarrhea (5%), and blurring of vision (1.2%). In the study by Million et al,23 none of the participants showed sign of cardiac toxicity.23 In the study by Molina et al,26 a single patient showed persistent QT prolongation and the medications had to be withdrawn. Chorin et al,22 found that among 84 patients they recruited, in 30% of patients, QTc prolonged by more than 40\u2009milliseconds and 11% of patients showed QTc of more than 500\u2009milliseconds. In multivariate analysis, they found that development of acute renal failure was a more stringent predictor of extreme QTc prolongation.224 DISCUSSION\nWhile comparing HCQ vs control/conventional treatment, two studies reported clinical cure parameters. The importance of clinical cure parameters can be highlighted by the fact that in the study by Gautret et al,17 one patient died despite having a virological cure. In our study, in terms of clinical cure parameters, two studies reported that time to body temperature normalization was less in the HCQ arm compared with the control/conventional treatment/standard treatment arm. On the other hand, total cough days were also lower in the HCQ treated arm compared with the control/conventional treatment/standard treatment arm. The benefit was also seen in terms of radiological progression (two studies) with less number of patients showing radiological progression in the HCQ arm compared with the control/conventional treatment/standard treatment arm (OR for radiological progression of disease during treatment with OR, 0.31; 95% CI, [0.11\u20100.9]). On the other hand, no difference was found in terms of virological cure on day 6 to 7 (two studies), death or clinical worsening of disease condition (three studies). However, limited sample size and nondefining the treatment of control group/standard treatment/conventional treatment are major limitations. Coming to safety, there was no difference seen between the conventional/standard treatment/control arm and the HCQ arm.\nRegarding recurrence of the disease during therapy, in the study by Gautret et al,17 one patient had a recurrence of the disease (being PCR negative initially, followed by a return of PCR positivity, while still on treatment with HCQ and Azi).17 So, the development of resistance to the drugs during therapy may be a possibility, which we need to be monitored closely.\nAs the study by Gautret et al,17 showed a high risk of bias, we conducted a sensitivity analysis and reanalyzed the same endpoints while excluding the data of Gautret et al.17 However, the final conclusions remained the same despite the exclusion of the study. Details of the sensitivity analysis can be found in Figure S2 to S4.\nTo address the issue of combining HCQ with other drugs, the two studies by Gautret et al,17, 24 and another study by the same group23 showed benefit in terms of efficacy of a combination of HCQ\u2009+\u2009Azi in COVID\u201019. In the first study,17 treatment with the combination resulted in 100% virological cure on day 6 post inclusion in the combination arm (n\u2009=\u20096), compared with 57.1% virological cure in the HCQ alone arm (n\u2009=\u200914) and 12.5% virological cure in the control arm (n\u2009=\u200916). In the second study also,24 they found virological clearance (total sample size\u2009=\u200980) in 83% of patients on day 7. Treatment with HCQ resulted in a shorter duration of hospital stay.24 However the six patients in the first study were also included in the second study. In the third study by the same group,23 virological cure was seen among 91.7% of the patients on day 10 with a very low mortality rate (0.47%). On the contrary, Molina et al,26 failed to replicate the findings of the obtained by Gautret et al.17 However, in the study by Molina et al,26 the patient population also had significant comorbidities (cancer, HIV, and obesity) and the patient population included belonged to severe COVID\u201019 category. We need further controlled studies for an effective conclusion.\nComing to safety issues of the combination, mild adverse events were reported by Gautret et al, 2020 which included nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and blurring of vision.24 In the study by Molina et al, 2020 a single patient showed electrocardiographic evidence of QT prolongation.26 Chorin et al, 2020 found that around 11% of the population on the combination therapy showed evidence of significant QTc prolongation (>\u2009500\u2009ms) and development of acute renal failure was an important predictor of extreme QTc prolongation.22\nThe key limitations of our study were a limited number of clinical studies with a limited number of participants and three studies being reported from the same group.\nAnother major limitation was the lack of control/conventional/standard group. In case of Jun et al,25 the control group was treated with conventional treatment. However, it is unknown what was basically given to treat the control arm. Many of the blogs claim that the control arm was treated with Kelatra (lopinavir\u2010ritonavir combination) and arbidol. All the patients in both the arms were also treated with interferon\u2010alpha.29 But the authenticity of this blog is unknown though. In the study by Gautret et al,17 patients who met exclusion criteria or who are not given hydroxychloroquine were treated as controls. However, how these controls were treated is unknown. In the study by Chen Z et al, 2020 also, details of treatment of the control/conventional treatment group is not available.16\nAnother concern is the return of PCR positivity in a patient who was turned PCR negative by treatment with HCQ\u2009+\u2009Azi. This highlights the possibility of occurrence of resistance to this regime. However this needs further validation.5 CONCLUSION\nTreatment with HCQ may result in a benefit in terms of less number of cases showing radiological progression, with comparable adverse events profile when compared to control/conventional/standard treatment. We can expect benefit in terms of time to body temperature normalization and a number of cough days. However, at this current point of time, no difference was seen in terms of virological cure on day six to seven postinitiation of therapy and composite death or worsening of disease. The benefit of the HCQ\u2009+\u2009Azi treatment is uncertain at this current point of time with most of the data being reported by the same research group. We need more clinical studies to come to a definite conclusion.ACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThe authors acknowledge PGIMER, Chandigarh Library for their kind support during this period of lockdown.CONFLICT OF INTERESTS\nAll the authors declared that there are no conflict of interests.AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS\nPS helped in developing the concept; PS, HRDK, MP, NS, SK, RS, AS, DPD, and BM assisted in protocol making; PS, HRDK, and DM conducted database search; HRDK and HK did the title abstract screen; PS, HRDK, HK, MP, NS, and SK helped in screening the full\u2010text; PS, PA, DPD, AP, and BM handled the discrepancy management; PS and HRDK conducted the data extraction; PS, HRDK, and BM did the data analysis; PS, HRDK, DM, and MP helped in ROB; PA, AB, MP, NS, SK, RS, AS, DPD, and AP wrote the manuscript; and all the authors gave the final approval for the article.", "25819": "Since March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization defined coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID\u201019) as a pandemic, with a series of confirmed cases that currently exceeded 300,000 people worldwide and with approximately 14,500 deaths.1 Accumulated evidence suggests that a subgroup of patients with severe COVID\u201019 could have a dysregulation of the immune response that allows the development of viral hyperinflammation.2 Thus, all patients with severe COVID\u201019 should be screened for hyperinflammation using laboratory parameters to improve mortality. Neutrophil\u2010to\u2010lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and lymphocyte\u2010to\u2010C\u2010reactive protein ratio (LCR) are established inflammation markers that reflect systemic inflammatory response,3, 4 and both are available in almost all laboratories. In this study, a meta\u2010analysis was performed to investigate whether NLR and LCR values can help predict clinical severity in patients with COVID\u201019.\nFirst, we conducted an electronic search in different search engines that included Medline (PubMed interface), Scopus, Web of Science via Raven and Google Scholar, using the keywords \u201cSevere 2019\u2010nCoV\u201d OR \"Severe COVID\u201019\" without date (i.e. until March 23, 2020) or language restrictions. The title, abstract, and full text of all the articles identified according to these search criteria were analyzed, considering for our meta\u2010analysis only those that reported data in COVID\u201019 patients with or without severe disease (defined as severe or with the need to enter the intensive care unit or the use of mechanical ventilation).\nSix studies were included in our meta\u2010analysis, four of them allowed us to calculate both NLR and LCR. The other two articles, one was considered only for NLR calculations and the other only for LCR calculations. Mean and standard deviation were extrapolated from the median, range, and sample size according to Hozo et al.5 For NLR, the number of neutrophils and lymphocytes was taken per 109/L, while LCR was calculated as follows: lymphocyte count (number/\u03bcL)/C\u2010reactive protein (mg/dL). Meta\u2010analysis was performed using Comprehensive Meta\u2010Analysis Software version 3 (2013, Biostat, Englewood, NJ) calculating the standardized mean difference (SMD) and the 95% confidence interval (95% CI) of the NLR and LCR values in patients with COVID\u201019 with or without severe disease.\nAll the studies were carried out in China and included a total number of 828 patients, where 407 patients had severe disease (49.15%) and the sample size varied between 41 and 452 patients. The SMD of the five studies used for each parameter is summarized in Figure 1. Since heterogeneity (I2 statistics) exceeded 50% in both meta\u2010analyses, a random effects model was used. The NLR values were found to increase significantly in patients with COVID\u201019 with severe disease (SMD\u2009=\u20092.404, 95% CI\u2009=\u20090.98\u20103.82), while LCR values were decreased significantly (SMD\u2009=\u2009\u22120.912, 95% CI\u2009=\u2009\u22121.275 to \u22120.550).\nFigure 1\nOpen in figure viewerPowerPoint\nStandardized mean difference (SMD) and 95% confidence interval (95% CI) of neutrophil\u2010to\u2010lymphocyte ratio and lymphocyte\u2010to\u2010C\u2010reactive protein ratio in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID\u201019) patients with or without severe disease\nDespite several reports describing increased levels of neutrophils and C\u2010reactive protein along with a decrease in lymphocyte numbers in patients with COVID\u201019,2, 6-10 until now, very few reports have considered the cost\u2010effective markers NLR and LCR to aid complication predictions. Acute respiratory distress syndrome, which is a type of respiratory failure characterized by a rapid onset of generalized inflammation in the lungs, is the leading cause of mortality of patients with COVID\u201019. Thus, increased NLR levels and low LCR levels reflecting an enhanced inflammatory process may suggest a poor prognosis.ACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nFALR is recipient of a doctoral scholarship (Application number 2018\u2010000012\u201001NACF\u201007226) from the National Council of Science and Technology, CONACyT.CONFLICT OF INTERESTS\nThe author declares that there is no conflict of interests.", "25826": "I have read with great interest the paper by Li et al1 entitled \u201cThe neuroinvasive potential of SARS\u2010CoV2 may be at least partially responsible for the respiratory failure of COVID\u201019 patients.\u201d I would like here to provide arguments indicating that an alteration of the dopamine synthetic pathways is possibly involved in the pathophysiology of COVID\u201019. A simple bioinformatics approach to predict new roles for any given gene consists in identifying the coexpression network it integrates with. To unravel putative neural impacts of SARS\u2010CoV2 infections, such a \u201cculprit\u2010by\u2010association\u201d strategy may be applied to Angiotensin I Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2), the gene encoding the main receptor to SARS\u2010CoV2, SARS\u2010CoV, and MERS\u2010CoV. To this aim, multiexperiment matrix (MEM)2 is a robust web tool allowing to combine and integrate correlation links between messenger RNA (mRNA) levels across a large number of human microarray datasets (precisely 2811). Surprisingly, according to MEM, the gene exhibiting the most statistically significant coexpression link with ACE2 is Dopa Decarboxylase (DDC) (P: 2.39E\u201061; Pearson correlation test). Based on the hypothesis put forward by Li et al1, this observation is possibly interesting for several reasons. DDC is indeed a major enzyme of both the dopamine and the serotonin synthetic pathways as it converts L\u20103,4\u2010dihydroxyphenylalanine (L\u2010DOPA) into dopamine and L\u20105\u2010hydroxytryptophan into serotonin. In addition, DDC also supports the conversion of histidine into histamine. That ACE2 coregulates with DDC indicates a possible functional link between the ACE2\u2010mediated synthesis of angiotensin 1\u20107 and the DDC\u2010mediated synthesis of dopamine and serotonin. Arguing for the existence of such a link, brain dopamine contents were shown to be increased following infusion of angiotensin 1\u20107 in the hypothalamus of rats.3 Along this line, angiotensin 1\u20107 was shown to stimulate the renal synthesis of dopamine.4 Conversely, that ACE2 coregulates with DDC also implies that any SARS\u2010CoV2\u2010induced downregulation of ACE2 expression, a process previously demonstrated for SARS\u2010CoV,5 might be paralleled by alterations of both the dopamine and serotonin synthetic pathways. Supporting this view, ACE2 knockout (KO) mice were reported to exhibit dramatically low serotonin levels in both the blood and brain.6 Dopamine levels were not assessed in this study but should be explored in future studies. While patients with COVID\u201019 might suffer from of a central autonomic failure of respiratory functions, it is important to keep in mind that ACE2 and DDC may coexpress and coregulate in nonneuronal cell types. Indeed, among the microarray datasets compiled in MEM, the most significant correlations between ACE2 and DDC mRNA levels are found in studies exploring colorectal adenocarcinoma samples. Confirming this observation, a survey of the database \u201cHuman Protein Atlas,\u201d the currently largest protein expression atlas of normal human tissues, shows that ACE2 and DDC are both highly expressed in intestinal epithelial cells. Since intestinal epithelial cells were shown to convert L\u2010DOPA into dopamine6 and to provide an important source of blood\u2010circulating dopamine,7 one may hypothesize that a defective expression of ACE2 and DDC in intestinal cells may translate into altered levels and/or regulation of dopamine in the blood of patients with COVID\u201019. This is all the more interesting as experiments performed in mice demonstrate that dopamine may shape lung immunity via dopamine receptors expressed by alveolar epithelial cells,8 lung macrophages,8 and lung terminal nerves.9 In particular, in a murine model of endotoxin\u2010induced acute lung injury, the dopamine D1 receptor agonist fenoldopam was shown to dampen inflammation as well as lung permeability and pulmonary edema.8 The potential protective role of dopamine in the context of viral infections has been poorly investigated until now. In this regard, it is worth noting that in a recent work, DDC was found to negatively regulate the replication of the Flaviviridae viruses dengue and hepatitis C.10 Experimental research works are needed to clarify the links between ACE2 and DDC during SARS\u2010CoV2 infection. Moreover, in patients suffering from severe forms of COVID\u201019, the hypothesis of a systemic failure of the dopamine synthetic pathway should be taken into account and further explored.CONFLICT OF INTEREST\nThe author declares that there is no conflict of interest.", "25815": "We read with interest the recent meta\u2010analysis by Sun et al1 that included 50\u2009466 patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID\u201019). The author found that fever and cough were the most common symptoms, and several subjects had muscle soreness or fatigue. In addition, they reported that \u201cby reading the included literature, we found that diarrhea, hemoptysis, headache, sore throat, shock, and other symptoms are rare.\u201d1\nRegarding sore throat, we believed that this could be a confounding affirmation. The majority of included patients (48\u2009981 subjects) in the review1 was extracted from studies that did not describe accurately the clinical presentation.2-4 The largest report on 44\u2009672 confirmed COVID\u201019 patients focused on critical cases and on the case\u2010fatality rate, without a detailed presentation of the symptoms.2 Yang et al3 showed limited data and we were able to download only a two pages manuscript. Sun et al4 described only age and sex on included patients. On the contrary, other studies that described the full symptoms spectrum of COVID\u201019 found that pharyngodynia was not rare. The sore throat was reported to be present in 5% to 17.4% of COVID\u201019 patients.5-7 Guan et al6 in a large series of 1099 COVID\u201019 patients found pharyngodynia in 13.9% of cases.\nAt this stage of the COVID\u201019 pandemic, it is fundamental to inform correctly health care providers. Real\u2010time reverse transcriptase\u2010polymerase chain reaction (RT\u2010PCR) assays were the standard for the detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS\u2010CoV\u20102) from respiratory secretions collected by nasal and oropharyngeal swabs.8 A high false\u2010negative rate (FNR) has been reported for these tests. Results from quantitative RT\u2010PCR could be affected by the variation of viral RNA sequences or by the viral load in different anatomic sites during the disease natural history.8 By estimate, FNR from one\u2010time testing was high as 30% to 50% in real COVID\u201019 cases.8 A recent report on 1014 COVID\u201019 cases found that only 59% of patients had positive SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 swabs at presentation, while chest computed tomography had higher sensitivity for the diagnosis of COVID\u201019.9 Consequently, the clinical presentation could be helpful in identifying suspected COVID\u201019 cases and we think that sore throat should not be considered a rare symptom as reported by Sun et al.1 This could lead to undiagnosed cases and to the spread of infection. Patients with the suspected disease should be isolated (use of individual rooms was recommended, with negative pressure if possible), and health personnel should use waterproof gowns, gloves, goggles, and surgical masks or FFP2 masks.10 Further studies are needed to clarify the importance of pharyngodynia in COVID\u201019.CONFLICT OF INTERESTS\nThe authors declare that there are no conflict of interests.", "25818": "We thank Andrea Lovato et al for their letter, which was written in response to our recent meta\u2010analysis published in the journal.1 From the news, we learned that the heroic Italian people are fighting the Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID\u201019) tenaciously. We wish you a great victory in this battle.\nIn our paper, we concluded by meta\u2010analysis that the incidence of fever was 0.891 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.818, 0.945), the incidence of cough was 0.722 (95% CI: 0.657, 0.782), and the incidence of muscle soreness or fatigue was 0.425 (95% CI: 0.213, 0.652). The incidence of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) was 0.148 (95% CI: 0.046, 0.296), the incidence of abnormal chest computer tomography (CT) was 0.966 (95% CI: 0.921, 0.993), the percentage of severe cases in all infected cases was 0.181 (95% CI: 0.127, 0.243), and the case fatality rate of patients with SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection was 0.043 (95% CI: 0.027, 0.061). By reading the relevant literature, we learned that diarrhea, hemoptysis, headache, sore throat, shock, and other symptoms are rare.\nIn our study, we included 10 relevant literatures and extracted data of common clinical symptoms from these studies for meta\u2010analysis.

Because some patients also have symptoms of a sore throat after a violent cough. The study by Huang et al4 also did not consider sore throat as a specific symptom of COVID\u201019. According to a recent study by Rodriguez\u2010Morales et al,5 the incidence of sore throat in COVID\u201019 patients was 11%. Compared with cough, fever, and muscle soreness or fatigue, sore throat is really rare in COVID\u201019 patients.\nIn the treatment of COVID\u201019 in China, few patients were treated for symptoms of sore throat. Most COVID\u201019 patients were asked by doctors for real\u2010time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT\u2010PCR) assays due to cough and fever. Chinese physicians found that the combination of RT\u2010PCR and chest CT could improve the diagnostic accuracy of COVID\u201019.\nOf course, we agree with you that no clinical symptom should be ignored. Although the incidence of sore throat in COVID\u201019 patients is not high, it should be paid more attention to by medical workers. COVID\u201019 is the common enemy of all mankind. According to the study of Rodriguez\u2010Morales et al,5 the case fatality rate of COVID\u201019 patients worldwide has reached 13.9%. Early diagnosis and treatment can effectively reduce the case fatality rate of COVID\u201019 patients before the development of specific drugs and vaccines to treat COVID\u201019.\nClinical practice has proved that the methods of prevention of COVID\u201019 that you mentioned in your article are scientific and effective.6 We also hope that you will share with us your experience and lessons learned in the treatment of COVID\u201019. We believe that with the concerted efforts of all mankind, we will surely overcome this plague.CONFLICT OF INTERESTS\nThe authors declare that there are no conflict of interests.", "25742": "1 INTRODUCTION\nIn December 2019, a new coronavirus (COVID\u201019) pneumonia outbreak occurred in Wuhan, China.1 Since the virus was detected in December 2019, more than 77\u2009000 people have been infected in China, causing more than 2600 deaths.2 Globally, cases have been reported in 33 countries and five continents.3 Patients' clinical manifestations included fever, cough, dyspnea, myalgia, fatigue, and chest computed tomography were ground\u2010glass opacity.4 A novel coronavirus currently named 2019 novel COVID\u201019, real\u2010time reverse\u2010transcriptase polymerase\u2010chain\u2010reaction (RT\u2010PCR) method can be used for the detection of COVID\u201019 in oral swabs.5 In SARS\u2010CoV and MERS\u2010CoV infected patients, intestinal infections are very common.6, 7 Results have now confirmed the presence of the live virus in stool samples from patients with COVID\u201019,8 which means that stool samples may contaminate hands, food, and water, and may cause infection by invading the mouth, respiratory mucosa, and conjunctiva. We report the detection method of 14 cases with confirmed COVID\u201019 infection admitted to hospitals in Jinhua, aiming to investigate the other possible transmission route of this virus.2 METHODS\nWe performed a retrospective analysis of 14 laboratory\u2010confirmed cases with COVID\u201019 pneumonia. Data were obtained from the Department of Infectious Diseases Jinhua Hospital of Zhejiang University. Patients were hospitalized from 27 January 2020 to 10 February 2020, with final follow\u2010up for this report on 9 February 2020. Early we are confirmed cases with COVID\u201019 pneumonia were a RT\u2010PCR assay for pharyngeal swab specimens, and that all oropharyngeal swabs specimens were collected by a senior infectious physician with more than 10 years of experience. Starting from 4 February 2020, we have added stool samples to all cases.3 RESULTS\nThe median age of the patients was 41 years (18\u201387 years), and 7 (50%) were female. The most common symptoms include fever (92.8%) and cough (71.4%), no fever is an 87\u2010year\u2010old female patient, all patients had no vomiting and diarrhea. Four patients (28.5%) returned from Wuhan, the remaining 10 (71.4%) had a history of contact with COVID\u201019 pneumonia patients.\nSince 4 February, we have collected patient samples intensively as the supply of PCR kits has increased. It was found that five of the 14 confirmed patients (35.7%) had a positive stool sample COVID\u201019 nucleic acid, and patients with positive stool samples were also positive for oropharyngeal swabs specimens at least the day before (Figure 1); The same trend is that patients with negative stool samples are also negative for oropharyngeal swabs for at least the first 2 days (Figure 1). This may indicate that the accuracy of fecal specimen detection and oropharyngeal swabs is the same.\nFigure 1\nOpen in figure viewerPowerPoint\nViral nucleic acid test results in 14 patients with COVID\u201019. COVID\u201019, coronavirus\nAll 14 patients had computed tomography on admission, 92.8% manifested as pneumonia. One patient (patient 3) chest computed tomography images did not demonstrate any consolidation or scarring (Figure 2), however, this patient was positive for multiple stools and oropharyngeal swabs specimens (Figure 1). Among the remaining 13 patients, ground\u2010glass opacity was observed in both lungs. Two patients (patient 6 and patient 14) severely yielded more prominent abnormalities on chest computed tomography than nonsevere cases (Figure 3), the nucleic acid test was negative for stool samples in these two patients, this indicates that fecal specimens are not related to nucleic acid positivity and severity. As of 9 February 2020, three patients recovered, but 11 were still being treated in the hospital.\nFigure 2\nOpen in figure viewerPowerPoint\nChest computed tomographic images, 5 February 2020 (illness day 10, hospital day 6)\nFigure 3\nOpen in figure viewerPowerPoint\nChest computed tomographic images.

Recently, reports of fecal nucleic acid tests to diagnose COVID\u201019 have increased.10, 11 In our cases, we found that patients with a positive stool test did not experience gastrointestinal symptoms and had nothing to do with the severity of the lung infection. Stool specimen collection will reduce medical staff infections compared to oropharyngeal swabs specimens, especially when protective equipment in China is inadequate. We are not sure if there is a fecal\u2010oral transmission, but fomite transmission might have contributed considerably to the rapid spread of COVID\u201019. Finally, this report highlights the need for health protection, which should be considered for transmission through stool, these discoveries will curb the rapid spread of COVID\u201019 worldwide.ACKNOWLEDGMENT\nThe author thanks Dr. Saibin Wang for sharing her personal observations.CONFLICT OF INTERESTS\nThe authors declare that there are no conflict of interests.", "25729": "1 INTRODUCTION\nIn recent years, novel coronavirus infections have emerged periodically in various countries around the world. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS\u2010CoV) occurred in 2002, infecting 8422 people and causing 916 deaths during the epidemic.1 Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS\u2010CoV) was first identified in 2012.2 At the end of December 2019, a total of 2499 laboratory\u2010confirmed cases of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), including 861 associated deaths were reported globally.3 At the end of 2019, novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP) emerged in Wuhan and had spread rapidly. The pathogen was confirmed new coronavirus, which was officially named coronavirus disease\u201019 (COVID\u201019) by the World Health Organization (WHO). As of February 21, 2020, a total of 76\u2009395 confirmed cases have been reported, and 2\u2009348 patients are reported to have died. Currently, there is no specific antiviral treatment for COVID\u201019. Therefore, identifying drug treatment options as soon as possible is critical for the response to the COVID\u201019 outbreak.\nSARS\u2010CoV, MERS\u2010CoV, and COVID\u201019 belong to the same genera of CoV and all are beta\u2010CoV. COVID\u201019 shares 79.5% sequence identity with SARS\u2010CoV.4 Therefore, the existing treatment LPV for SARS and MERS may be helpful for developing COVID\u201019 therapeutics.\nProteinase is a key enzyme in CoV polyprotein processing. In recent years, research on SARS\u2010CoV and MERS\u2010CoV protease inhibitors has been carried out in vitro and in vivo. Lopinavir (LPV) is a proteinase inhibitor. Both peak (9.6\u2009\u00b5g/mL) and trough (5.5\u2009\u00b5g/mL) serum concentrations of LPV inhibit SARS\u2010CoV.5 LPV also blocks a post\u2010entry step in the MERS\u2010CoV replication cycle.6 Ritonavir (RTV) inhibits the CYP3A\u2010mediated metabolism of LPV, thereby increasing the serum concentration of LPV. Lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r) is a combination of lopinavir and ribavirin. The antiviral activity of LPV/r is similar to that of LPV alone, suggesting that the effect is largely driven by LPV.7, 8 In this review, we analyze the efficacy of LPV or LPV/r in patients with SARS\u2010CoV and MERS\u2010CoV, which can be a useful reference for COVID\u201019 treatment option.2 IN VITRO AND ANIMAL STUDIES\n2.1 In vitro studies of SARS\nAn analysis of molecular dynamics simulations showed that the SARS\u2010CoV 3CLpro enzyme could be inhibited by the combination of lopinavir and ritonavir.9 A binding analysis of the main SARS coronavirus proteinase with LPV showed that half of lopinavir is left outside the catalytic site, and the efficacy of lopinavir may be poor.10 Another study showed that neither lopinavir nor ritonavir has an effect on the replication of SARS\u2010CoV.11\nHowever, studies have revealed that lopinavir has antiviral activity. The 50% effective inhibitory concentration (EC50) of LPV for the plaque reduction assay is 6\u2009\u00b5g/mL in the Vero cell line. The selectivity index (SI) of LPV is 8 to 32.12 In vitro activity against SARS\u2010CoV has been demonstrated for lopinavir at 4\u2009\u00b5g/mL after 48\u2009hours of incubation. Cytopathic inhibition has been achieved down to a concentration of lopinavir 1\u2009\u00b5g/mL combined with ribavirin at 6.25\u2009\u00b5g/mL and data suggested that this combination may be synergistic against SARS\u2010CoV in vivo.13\n2.2 Animal studies of SARS\nThere have been some animal studies of SARS,14 however, no study of lopinavir or ritonavir has been performed.\n2.3 In vitro studies of MERS\nIn an in vitro study, LPV inhibited MERS\u2010CoV\u2010induced cytopathic effect (CPE) with an EC50 of 8.0\u2009\u03bcM (SI\u2009=\u20093.1), and a maximal protective effect (89% inhibition) was observed at a dose of 12\u2009\u03bcM.6 However, an in vitro study showed that LPV was not effective. LPV showed a suboptimal EC50 in the initial cytopathic effect inhibition assay and was therefore not evaluated further.15 Another in vivo study of MERS showed that EC50 values generated for lopinavir and ritonavir were 11.6 and 24.9\u2009\u03bcM with CC50 values\u2009>\u200950\u2009\u03bcM, the SI for LPV and RTV was >\u20094.3 and >\u20092, respectively.7 Compared with remdesivir and interferon\u2010\u03b2 (IFN\u2010\u03b2), LPV has inferior in vitro antiviral activity. RTV does not significantly enhance the antiviral activity of LPV in vitro.7\n2.4 Animal studies of MERS\nFor the MERS\u2010CoV mouse model, prophylactic LPV/r combined with IFN\u2010\u03b2 slightly reduced the viral loads.7 However, therapeutic LPV/r and IFN\u2010\u03b2 improved pulmonary function, but failed to reduce viral replication and lung hemorrhaging. This in vivo evidence is suggestive of the potential for LPV/r to treat MERS\u2010CoV infections. When LPV/r was combined with IFN\u2010\u03b2, the antiviral activity (EC50\u2009=\u2009160\u2009IU/mL) was indistinguishable from that of IFN\u2010\u03b2 alone (EC50\u2009=\u2009175\u2009IU/mL, P\u2009=\u2009.62). This suggests that the observed in vitro antiviral activity of the LPV/r\u2010IFN\u2010\u03b2 combination against MERS\u2010CoV is dominated by IFN\u2010\u03b2 when LPV/r is used at clinically relevant concentrations.\nChan et al16 explored the therapeutic potential of LPV/r and/or IFN\u2010\u03b2 in common marmosets. Animals treated with LPV/r alone or in combination with interferon\u03b21b had better clinical scores, less weight reduction, and less pulmonary infiltrate than untreated animals. Furthermore, necropsied lung and extrapulmonary tissues from the treated group had lower mean viral loads than those from the control group.\nThe in vitro and animal studies of SARS and MERS are summarized in Table 1.\nTable 1.

Twenty\u2010one percent of 33 patients who received LPV/r as a rescue therapy died, whereas 42% of 77 patients who received ribavirin alone died.17 However, these results were given only as a presentation, and no formal paper was published. Thus, this evidence is not credible.\nA retrospective matched cohort study including 1052 SARS patients (75 treated patients and 977 control patients) showed that the addition of LPV/r as an initial treatment was associated with a reduced death rate (2.3%) and intubation rate (0%) compared with that in a matched cohort who received standard treatment (11.0% and 15.6%, respectively, P\u2009<\u2009.05).18 In addition, the rate and dose of pulsed methylprednisolone were decreased. These SARS patients were retrospectively matched with control subject. Matching was performed with respect to age, sex, the presence of comorbidities, lactate dehydrogenase level, and the use of pulsed steroid therapy. However, the mortality, oxygen desaturation, and intubation rates of the subgroup of patients who received lopinavir\u2010ritonavir as rescue therapy were not different from those in the matched cohort and patients who received an increased dose of pulsed methylprednisolone. This result suggests that the combination of lopinavir and ribavirin has a synergistic effect for the treatment of SARS; it may play an essential role in the early phase of the infection. The viral replication phase peaks around day 10.19 LPV/r use within this replication window decreases the peak viral load and the subsequent immune response.\nAnother retrospective matched cohort study of SARS patient also revealed that the rate of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) or death was significantly lower in the LPV/r combination treatment group (1/41, 2.4%) than the historical controls (32/111, 28.8%) on day 21.13 In addition, the LPV/r group had a progressive decrease in the viral load, an early rise in the lymphocyte count, a reduction in the cumulative dose of pulsed methylprednisolone, and fewer episodes of nosocomial infections. These findings show that LPV/r, when combined with ribavirin, may be an effective agent against SARS. The summary of the effects of LPV in SARS patients is shown in Table 2.\nTable 2.

Another 64\u2010year\u2010old MERS patient from Korea was also treated with LPV/r, ribavirin, and interferon. After 6 days of antiviral therapy, negative PCR result in the serum sample, sputum samples, and swab samples were achieved.21 The patient was discharged on day 13 of admission after achieving complete recovery. These two simple cases may show that LPV is effective against MERS. However, they do not exclude the possibility of other combination therapies being effective or spontaneous improvement occurring. The treatment effect of LPV/r against MERS is still controversial.\nA retrospective study enrolled healthcare workers (HCWs) with high\u2010risk exposure to MERS\u2010CoV pre\u2010isolation pneumonia and revealed that an effective post\u2010exposure prophylaxis (PEP) strategy including LPV/r may limit the spread of infection.22 PEP therapy was associated with a 40% decrease in the risk of infection with no severe adverse events during treatment. PEP therapy was a significant factor that reduced the risk of MERS\u2010CoV infection in HCWs. This finding may indirectly reflect the antiviral effect of LPV/r. Moreover, a combination regimen of interferon\u2009+\u2009ribavirin\u2009+\u2009LPV/r was recommended officially for MERS therapy in Korea, where MERS began to spread in 2015.23 Without randomized controlled trials, determining treatment is difficult due to patient and treatment variability as well as a lack of appropriately matched controls. The combination of LPV/r and interferon was considered in a randomized control trial in Saudi Arabia.24 Enrollment began in November 2016 and the results are not yet available. The summary of LPV research in MERS patients is shown in Table 3.\nTable 3.

Four patients with COVID\u201019 were given antiviral treatment including LPV/r. After treatment, three patients showed significant improvement in pneumonia\u2010associated symptoms, two of whom were confirmed to be COVID\u201019 negative and discharged, and one of whom was negative for the virus at the first test.25 This study shows the positive effects of LPV/r therapy. Two reviews, including a Chinese review and communication showed that LPV may be drug treatment option for COVID\u201019.26, 27 However, a retrospective study enrolled 134 NCP patients revealed that there is no significant difference between LPV/r\u2010treated group (n\u2009=\u200952), Abidol\u2010treated group (n\u2009=\u200934), and control group (n\u2009=\u200948) in improving symptom or in reducing viral loads.28 The negative rate of COVID\u201019 nucleic acid on the 7 day was 71.8%, 82.6%, and 77.1%, respectively (P\u2009=\u2009.79). The efficacy of LPV/r antiviral treatment warrants further verification in future studies.

Upon the emergence of SARS\u2010CoV and MERS\u2010CoV, patients were administered off\u2010label antivirals. Most in vitro studies have shown that SARS\u2010CoV could be inhibited by LPV and that the EC50 of LPV is acceptable. Furthermore, two retrospective matched cohort studies of SARS patients revealed that LPV/r plays an essential role in the clinical outcome, especially in the early stage. LPV/r\u2010treatment alone or in combination with interferon had improved clinical outcomes in experiments involving common marmosets and in some MERS patient. However, we need to wait for more clinically valid evidence to confirm the positive value of LPV for COVID\u201019 treatment.\nAlthough most of the data indicate the efficacy of LPV, adverse reactions should be kept in mind. Diarrhea, nausea, and asthenia are the most frequently reported reactions in patients receiving LPV therapy.5 Elevated total bilirubin, triglyceride, and hepatic enzyme levels have also been reported.20, 21 A retrospective study of MERS showed that the most common symptoms and laboratory tests of LPV/r PEP were diarrhea (40.9%), nausea (40.9%), stomatitis (18.2%), fever (13.6%), anemia (45.0%), leukopenia (40.0%), and hyperbilirubinemia (100%).22 However, the symptoms and laboratory tests returned to normal after LPV therapy ceased.\nThe protease inhibitor LPV could be an effective treatment based on the experience accumulated from the SARS and MERS outbreaks. The treatment of CoV patients with LPV/r improved their outcomes. LPV/r may be a potential treatment option for COVID\u201019. Additional studies are needed to gain further insights into the origin, tropism, and pathogenesis of COVID\u201019.ACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThis study was supported by the Scientific Research Seed Fund of Peking University First Hospital (#2018SF049 to JD Qian) and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (#81870417 to YW).CONFLICT OF INTERESTS\nThe authors declare that there are no conflict of interests.AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS\nTTY and JDQ wrote the article, include the concept of this article, definition of intellectual content, and data acquisition; WYZ contributed for data acquisition; YW and GQW designed and reviewed the manuscript for its intellectual content.", "25766": "1 INTRODUCTION\nIn late December 2019, an outbreak of an unknown disease called pneumonia of unknown cause occurred in Wuhan, Hubei province, China.1 The outbreak has spread substantial to infect 9720 people in China with 213 deaths and to infect 106 people in 19 other countries up to 31 January 2020 (https://www.who.int/docs/default\u2010source/coronaviruse/situation\u2010reports/20200131\u2010sitrep\u201011\u2010ncov.pdf). A few days later, the causative agent of this mysterious pneumonia was identified as a novel coronavirus (nCoV) by several independent laboratories.2-4 The causative virus has been temporarily named as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS\u2010CoV\u20102) and the relevant infected disease has been named as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID\u201019) by the World Health Organization, respectively. According to the daily report of the World Health Organization, the epidemic of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 so far registered 78\u2009630 cases and 2747 deaths in China, spread to 46 other countries that reported a total of 3664 cases by 27 February 2020 (https://www.who.int/docs/default\u2010source/coronaviruse/situation\u2010reports/20200227\u2010sitrep\u201038\u2010covid\u201019.pdf). COVID\u201019 epidemic has become a global health threat.\nCoronaviruses (CoVs) are a group of highly diverse, enveloped, positive\u2010sense, and single\u2010stranded RNA viruses.5 They cause several diseases involving respiratory, enteric, hepatic, and neurological systems with vary severity among humans and animals.5, 6 Human CoV infections have traditionally caused a low percentage of annual respiratory infections. There are HCoV\u2010OC43, HCoV\u2010229E, HCoV\u2010NL63, and HCoV\u2010HKU1, which cause mild respiratory illness.5, 7 Over the past 2 decades, two novel CoVs, severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV (SARS\u2010CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome CoV (MERS\u2010CoV), have emerged and cause severe human diseases.8, 9 During the epidemic, SARS\u2010CoV infect more than 8000 people worldwide with nearly 800 fatalities, representing its mortality rate around 10%. Whereas MERS\u2010CoV infected over 857 official cases and 334 deaths, making its mortality rate approximately 35%.10-12 So far, SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 is the seventh member of the family of CoVs that infects humans. The main symptoms of COVID\u201019 included fever, fatigue, and cough, which are similar to that of SARS\u2010CoV and MERS\u2010CoV infected cases. There are some overlapping and discrete aspects of the pathology and pathogenesis of these CoVs which cause severe diseases in humans.13\nMany literature reported the clinical features, virology, pathology, and radiology of COVID\u201019, but the comprehensive review is few. The purpose of this review is primarily to review the pathogen, clinical features, diagnosis, and treatment of COVID\u201019, but also to comment briefly on the epidemiology and pathology based on the current evidence.2 THE PATHOGEN\nThe pathogen that causes COVID\u201019 is a nCoV that was first identified in the late January 2020, named SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 (also known as 2019\u2010nCoV).2-4\nSARS\u2010CoV\u20102 is a novel member of CoVs, which are a large group of highly diverse, enveloped, positive\u2010sense, and single\u2010stranded RNA viruses.5 Recent research reported that SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 likely originated in bats, based on the similarity of its genetic sequence to that of other CoVs.14 The intermediate animal host of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 between a probable bat reservoir and humans is still unknown.15 Although this nCoV has genetic features that are compatible with the family of CoV, nevertheless it has distinct gene sequences that are significantly different from previously sequenced CoVs (Table 1). The analysis of samples from seven SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infected patients suggested that SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 shares 79.5% sequence identity to SARS\u2010CoV.3 Simplot analysis showed that SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 share 96.2% overall genome sequence identity to RaTG13, which is a short RdRp region from a bat CoV.3 Phylogenetic analysis revealed that SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 falls into the subgenus Sarbecovirus of the genus Betacoronavirus and is distinct from SARS\u2010CoV.2, 4\nTable 1.

S protein binds to the cellular receptor ACE2 to facilitate the entry of the virus. After the fusion of viral and plasma membranes, virus RNA undergoes replication and transcription. The proteins are synthesized. Viral proteins and new RNA genome are subsequently assembled in the ER and Golgi, followed by budding into the lumen of the ERGIC. New virions are released through vesicles. ACE2, angiotensin\u2010converting enzyme 2; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; ERGIC, endoplasmic reticulum\u2010Golgi intermediate compartment\nThe biophysical and structural analysis indicated that S protein of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 binds ACE2 with approximately10\u2010 to 20\u2010fold higher affinity than S protein of SARS\u2010CoV.18 The high affinity of S protein for human ACE2 may facilitate the spread of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 in human populations. Meanwhile, SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 does not use other CoV receptors, such as aminopeptidase N and dipeptidyl peptidase 4 to enter cells.33 EPIDEMIOLOGY\nBriefly, cases tend to be in clusters which arrive in waves, and develop into larger outbreaks all over the world. The first documented outbreak occurred primarily in Wuhan.1 According to the daily report of the World Health Organization, the epidemic of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 so far registered 78\u2009630 cases and 2747 deaths in China, spread to 46 other countries that reported a total of 3664 cases by 27 February 2020.\nThere are evidence suggest that transmission mode is human to human.25, 26 The major route of transmission of COVID\u201019 is droplet and close contact.26 Whether infection can occur through the oral or conjunctival routes is unknown, but SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 has been detected in tears,27 which is resemble to SARS\u2010CoV.28 Reproductive number (R0) was estimated by some studies. On the basis of clinical data of patients in COVID\u201019 early outbreak, the mean R0 was ranging from 2.20 to 3.58, meaning that each patient has been spreading infection to two or three other people.25, 29 It is still too early to develop an accurate R0 estimate or to assess the dynamics of transmission. More research is needed in the future.\nThe mean incubation period is about 5 days, ranging from 1 to 14 days and 95% of patients are likely to experience symptoms within 12.5 days of contact.25, 30 These data suggest a 14\u2010day medical observation period or quarantine for exposed and close contact persons. However, an asymptomatic carrier was reported and the incubation period was 19 days, suggesting the complicated challenge to contain the outbreak.314 CLINICAL FEATURES\nMost case patients were 30 to 79 years of age.32 The median age is ranging from 49 to 59 years.25, 26, 33, 34 There were few cases in children below 15 years of age. More than half the patients were male. Nearly half the cases had one or more coexisting medical conditions, such as hypertension, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease.25, 26, 33, 34 A large cases study indicated that the case\u2010fatality rate was elevated among those patients with coexisting medical conditions.32\nThe spectrum of clinical presentations of COVID\u201019 has been reported ranging from asymptomatic infection to severe respiratory failure.25, 26, 30, 32-34 The main symptoms include a self\u2010reported fever, fatigue, dry cough, myalgia, and dyspnea. The uncommon symptoms include sputum production, headache, hemoptysis, and diarrhea.25, 26, 30, 32-34 Although pneumonia is present in most SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infected patients, few cases complained of pleuritic chest pain.26, 33\nAccording to the severity of symptoms, patients can be classified as mild, severe, and critical types32 (Table 2). Mild patients had nonpneumonia or mild pneumonia. Severe patients had several clinical findings, including dyspnea, respiratory frequency\u2009\u2265\u200930/min, blood oxygen saturation\u2009\u2264\u200993%, partial pressure of arterial oxygen to fraction of inspired oxygen ratio less than 300, and/or lung infiltrates greater than 50% within 24 to 48\u2009hours. Critical patients had severe conditions, such as respiratory failure, septic shock, and/or multiple organ dysfunction or failure.32 If the disease progressed, the median duration period from illness onset to dyspnea was 8.0 days, and to mechanical ventilation was 10.5 days.34\nTable 2.

Lactate dehydrogenase and creatinine kinase are all elevated. Half of patients had abnormal liver function, with elevated alanine aminotransferase or aspartate aminotransferase. Most patients had abnormal myocardial zymogram, which showed the elevation of creatine kinase and lactate dehydrogenase. Most patients showed normal serum levels of procalcitonin, but the C\u2010reactive protein was above the normal range. One\u2010third of patients had the elevation of D\u2010dimer.25, 30, 33, 34\nOne study investigated the changes of several cytokines in serum in the COVID\u201019 patients.34 Initial plasma IL1B, interleukin\u20101 receptor antagonist (IL1RA), IL7, IL8, IL9, IL10, basic fibroblast growth factor, granulocyte colony\u2010stimulating factor (GCSF), granulocyte\u2010macrophage colony\u2010stimulating factor, interferon \u03b3, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, MIP1B, platelet\u2010derived growth factor, tumor necrosis factor (TNF\u2010\u03b1), and vascular endothelial growth factor concentrations were higher in patients than in healthy adults. Plasma levels of IL5, IL12p70, IL15, eotaxin, and RANTES were similar between patients and healthy adults. Further comparison between intensive care unit (ICU) and non\u2010ICU patients showed that plasma concentrations of IL2, IL7, IL10, GCSF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNF\u2010\u03b1 were higher in ICU patients than non\u2010ICU patients.34 These findings suggested that the initiation of the immune response result in the production of chemokines and cytokines, which damage normal host lung.\nThe radiologic manifestations of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infected patients are diverse and progressing rapidly.35-38 Two\u2010third of patients had at least two affected lobes, nearly half of patients had five affected lobes.37, 38 The most common manifestations are patchy ground\u2010glass opacities (GGO) and patchy consolidation which were mainly distributed in the middle and outer zone of the lung37, 38 (Figure 2). A little fibrous stripe may appear if the condition was improved.37 One report suggested that there are four stages defined on CT scan.36 In early stage, GGO was the main radiological demonstration distributed in the lower lobes unilaterally or bilaterally. In progressive stage, diffuse and bilateral GGO and consolidation in more than two lobes became the main manifestation. In peak stage, the diffuse GGO and dense consolidation became more prevalent. In absorption stage, extensive GGO could be observed and the consolidation was gradually absorbed.\nFigure 2\nOpen in figure viewerPowerPoint\nChest CT Manifestations of COVID\u201019.

COVID\u201019, coronavirus disease 2019; CT, computed tomography; GGO, ground\u2010glass opacities5 PATHOLOGY\nThe pathological findings of human SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection have been limited due to the rare number of biopsies or autopsies. In a case reported by Xu et al,39 a 50\u2010year\u2010old man died 14 days after admission due to respiratory failure and cardiac arrest.39 The primary finding of biopsy at autopsy was bilateral diffuse alveolar damage with cellular fibromyxoid exudates and interstitial mononuclear inflammatory infiltrates dominated by lymphocytes. Multinucleated syncytial cells with atypical enlarged pneumocytes characterized by large nuclei, amphophilic granular cytoplasm, and prominent nucleoli were identified in the intraalveolar spaces, showing viral cytopathic\u2010like changes. No obvious intranuclear or intracytoplasmic viral inclusions were identified. These pathological features show great similarities to SARS\u2010CoV and MERS\u2010CoV infection.40-42 In addition, liver and heart were studied. There is moderate microvascular steatosis and mild lobular and portal activity in the liver tissue and a few interstitial mononuclear inflammatory infiltrates in the heart tissue.6 DIAGNOSIS\nAlthough a good contact history, systemic symptoms, and radiographic changes of pneumonia make the diagnosis likely, the laboratory diagnosis is more reliable. Real time\u2010polymerase chain reaction (RT\u2010PCR) is routinely used to detect causative viruses from respiratory secretions.43, 44 During COVID\u201019 transmission events, RT\u2010PCR has served as the primary clinical laboratory diagnostic test.25, 26, 30, 33 Success of these tests are very important to understand the viral kinetics and tissue tropism found in COVID\u201019 cases. Several specific and sensitive assays targeting RdRP, N, and E genes of the SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 genome were designed to detect viral RNA in clinical specimens.44 Lower respiratory tract samples provide the higher viral loads.45 The sampling source or operation may affect RT\u2010PCR testing results.43\nThe positive rate of RT\u2010PCR for throat swab samples was reported to be about 60% in early stage of COVID\u201019.46 These findings suggested that the result of RT\u2010PCR should be interpret with caution. One study investigated the diagnostic value and consistency of chest computed tomography (CT) compared with RT\u2010PCR test in 1014 patients with suspected SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection. The results suggest that the sensitivity of chest CT in suspected patients was 97% based on positive RT\u2010PCR result and 75% based on negative RT\u2010PCR results. These findings indicated that chest CT is a sensitive modality to detect SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection.\nDuring the COVID\u201019 epidemic in China, 10\u2009567 patients were diagnosed as clinical diagnosed cases. This designation is being used in Hubei province, where is the worst affected area in China. In these cases, no RT\u2010PCR test was performed but diagnosis was made based on typical symptoms, exposure history, and chest CT manifestations consistent with COVID\u201019 pneumonia. Under this criteria, 10\u2009567 cases were diagnosed and isolated. This strategy quarantined a large number of suspected people and protected the healthy people to the most extent. On the basis of experiences above, we strongly recommend that the criteria of clinical diagnosed cases based on the symptoms, exposure history, and typical manifestations on chest CT imaging should be used in COVID\u201019 affected areas that are in shortage of RT\u2010PCR testing kits to control the COVID\u201019 epidemic.7 TREATMENT\nUntil the diagnosis is confirmed, SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infected patients are treated in single rooms.25, 30 As SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 is an emerging virus, an effective antiviral treatment has not been identified. The main treatment of COVID\u201019 is symptomatic treatment. The antiviral drugs, including oseltamivir, ribavirin, ganciclovir, lopinavir, and ritonavir have been used in attempts to reduce viral load and to prevent the likelihood of respiratory complications in several studies.25, 26, 30, 33, 34 Remdesivir was reported in the treatment of a patient with COVID\u201019 in the United States and got an effective result.47 However, the efficacy of these antiviral drugs for COVID\u201019 need to be verified by randomized\u2010controlled clinical trials.\nThe antibiotics used generally covered common pathogens and some atypical pathogens. When secondary bacterial infection occurred, medication was administered according to the results of bacterial culture and drug sensitivity.33 Current evidence in patients with SARS and MERS suggests that receiving corticosteroids did not have a survival benefit, but rather delayed viral clearance.48-50 Therefore, routine corticosteroids should be avoided unless they are indicated for other reason. Arbidol is used empirically in China because of its direct antiviral effect on SARS\u2010CoV in cell culture.51 Chinese herbal medicine formulae are used to prevent SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection in 23 provinces in China.52\nNoninvasive or mechanical ventilation should be considered in patients with hypoxia despite oxygen supplement and worsening shortness of breath. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation is used as a last resort.30, 33, 348 PROGNOSIS\nAs of 27 February 2020, a total of 2747 deaths in China and 57 deaths outside of China have been reported. The number of laboratory\u2010confirmed cases and deaths continues to rise. The current reported mortality for COVID\u201019 is approximately 3.41% compared to 10% for SARS and 35% for MERS.10-12, 53 The mortality rate was higher than 3.41% in Iran and France, lower in Italy, Japan, Republic of Korea, and United States (Figure 3). Considering the quick spread of COVID\u201019, it is still too early to assess the mortality. All countries in the world should respond to the epidemic effectively. Approximately, 20% to 25% SARS\u2010CoV\u20102\u2010infected patients developed acute respiratory distress syndrome and required ICU care.30, 33, 34 Current evidence indicated that older age and comorbidity may be risk factors for poor outcome.30\nFigure 3\nOpen in figure viewerPowerPoint\nMortality rates of different countries or regions, 27 February 2020. *A cruise ship currently in Japanese territorial waters9 SUMMARY AND OUTLOOK\nThis review summarizes the current findings of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 along with the treatment for this severe CoV infection. The most common symptoms were addressed. Due to the only biopsy report, the pathological findings associated with SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection have been limited. Autopsy is warranted and valuable for future research.\nThe WHO issued a public health emergency of international concern on 30 January 2020. SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 epidemic is becoming a global concern. At the moment, there is no vaccine and no specific treatment for COVID\u201019. The best strategy to deal with SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 epidemic includes controlling the sources of infection, protecting the susceptible people, and cutting off the transmission. The infected patients should be identified early by rapid and robust detection technologies, provided with optimized treatment in isolation timely. The close contact people should be quarantined with follow\u2010up. The healthy people should be aware of the severity of COVID\u201019 and take measures to protect themselves, such as staying at home, limiting social contacts, and wearing protective mask in public. The authorities should encourage people to stay at home; discourage mass gathering; postpone or cancel public events; and close public institutions. These control measures will help COVID\u201019 infected countries to prevent the epidemic effectively. Future research will focus on improving the accuracy of early diagnostic tests, developing the vaccine and identifying effective drugs. Therefore, elucidating the pathogenesis of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection is imperative for achieving such goals.ACKNOWLEDGMENT\nThe authors would like to thank all the doctors and nurses who fight the virus during the COVID\u201019 epidemic bravely.CONFLICT OF INTERESTS\nThe authors declare that there are no conflict of interests.", "25707": "1 INTRODUCTION\nCoronaviruses (CoVs) belong to the subfamily Orthocoronavirinae in the family of Coronaviridae in the order Nidovirales, and this subfamily including \u03b1\u2010coronavirus, \u03b2\u2010coronavirus, \u03b3\u2010coronavirus, and delta\u2010coronavirus.1 Coronaviruses primarily cause enzootic infections in birds and mammals and, in the last decades, have shown to be capable of infecting humans as well.2 The outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2002 and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) in 2012 has demonstrated the lethality of coronaviruses when they cross the species barrier and infect humans.2 SARS\u2010CoV and MERS\u2010CoV all belong to the \u03b2\u2010coronavirus family.3 Recently, a novel flu\u2010like coronavirus (COVID\u201019) related to the MERS and SARS coronaviruses was found at the end of 2019 in China4, 5 and the evidence of human\u2010to\u2010human transmission was confirmed among close contacts.6 The genome of COVID\u201019 is a single\u2010stranded positive\u2010sense RNA.7 The sequence analysis showed that the COVID\u201019 possessed a typical genome structure of coronavirus and belonged to the cluster of \u03b2\u2010coronaviruses including SARS\u2010CoV and MERS\u2010CoV.7 COVID\u201019 was more than 82% identical to those of SARS\u2010CoV.8, 9 COVID\u201019 may spread worldwide with the pandemic. Currently, there is no registered treatment or vaccine for the disease. In the absence of a specific treatment for this novel virus, there is an urgent need to find an alternative solution to prevent and control the replication and spread of the virus. We have done an online search on PubMed and Web of Science with the keywords of SARS, MERS, and coronaviruses. We summarize and propose therapeutic options available for the treatment of this novel coronaviruses.2 GENERAL TREATMENT FOR VIRAL INFECTION\n2.1 Nutritional interventions\n2.1.1 Vitamin A\nVitamin A is the first fat\u2010soluble vitamin to be recognized and \u03b2\u2010carotene is its plant\u2010derived precursor (Table 1). There are three active forms of vitamin A in the body, retinol, retinal, and retinoic acid. Vitamin A is also called \u201canti\u2010infective\u201d vitamin and many of the body's defenses against infection depend on an adequate supply. Researchers have believed that an impaired immune response is due to the deficiency of a particular nutritional element.10 Vitamin A deficiency is strongly involved in measles and diarrhea11 and measles can become severe in vitamin A\u2010deficient children. In addition, Semba et al12 had reported that vitamin A supplementation reduced morbidity and mortality in different infectious diseases, such as measles, diarrheal disease, measles\u2010related pneumonia, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, and malaria. Vitamin A supplementation also offers some protection against the complications of other life\u2010threatening infections, including malaria, lung diseases, and HIV.13 Jee et al14 had reported that low vitamin A diets might compromise the effectiveness of inactivated bovine coronavirus vaccines and render calves more susceptible to infectious disease. The effect of infection with infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), a kind of coronaviruses, was more pronounced in chickens fed a diet marginally deficient in vitamin A than in those fed a diet adequate in vitamin A.15 The mechanism by which vitamin A and retinoids inhibit measles replication is upregulating elements of the innate immune response in uninfected bystander cells, making them refractory to productive infection during subsequent rounds of viral replication.16 Therefore, vitamin A could be a promising option for the treatment of this novel coronavirus and the prevention of lung infection.\nTable 1.

Chinese medicine SARS\u2010CoV, avian infectious bronchitis virus\nAbbreviations: MERS\u2010CoV, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus; SARS\u2010CoV, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus.\n2.1.2 B vitamins\nB vitamins are water\u2010soluble vitamins and work as part of coenzymes. Each B vitamin has its special functions. For example, vitamin B2 (riboflavin) plays a role in the energy metabolism of all cells. Vitamin B2 deficiency had been suspected to occur among US elderly.17 Keil et al18 had reported that vitamin B2 and UV light effectively reduced the titer of MERS\u2010CoV in human plasma products. Vitamin B3, also called nicotinamide, could enhance the killing of Staphylococcus aureus through a myeloid\u2010specific transcription factor and vitamin B3 was efficacious in both prophylactic and therapeutic settings.19 Moreover, vitamin B3 treatment significantly inhibited neutrophil infiltration into the lungs with a strong anti\u2010inflammatory effect during ventilator\u2010induced lung injury. However, it also paradoxically led to the development of significant hypoxemia.20 Vitamin B6 is also needed in protein metabolism and it participates in over 100 reactions in body tissues. In addition, it also plays important role in body immune function as well. As shortage of B vitamins may weaken host immune response, they should be supplemented to the virus\u2010infected patients to enhance their immune system. Therefore, B vitamins could be chosen as a basic option for the treatment of COVID\u201019.\n2.1.3 Vitamin C\nVitamin C is another water\u2010soluble vitamin and it is also called ascorbic acid, which means \u201cno\u2010scurvy acid.\u201d Vitamin C is best known for its role in the synthesis of collagen in connective tissues and acts as an antioxidant. Vitamin C also supports immune functions and protects against infection caused by a coronavirus.21 For example, Atherton et al22 had reported that vitamin C increased the resistance of chick embryo tracheal organ cultures to avian coronavirus infection. Vitamin C may also function as a weak antihistamine agent to provide relief from flu\u2010like symptoms such as sneezing, a running or stuffy nose, and swollen sinuses.23 Three human controlled trials had reported that there was significantly lower incidence of pneumonia in vitamin C\u2010supplemented groups, suggesting that vitamin C might prevent the susceptibility to lower respiratory tract infections under certain conditions.24 The COVID\u201019 had been reported to cause lower respiratory tract infection, so vitamin C could be one of the effective choices for the treatment of COVID\u201019.\n2.1.4 Vitamin D\nVitamin D is not only a nutrient but also a hormone, which can be synthesized in our body with the help of sunlight. In addition to its role in maintaining bone integrity, it also stimulates the maturation of many cells including immune cells. A high number of healthy adults have been reported to be with low levels of vitamin D, mostly at the end of the Winter season.25 In addition, people who are housebound, or institutionalized and those who work at night may have vitamin D deficiency, as do many elderly people, who have limited exposure to sunlight.26 The COVID\u201019 was first identified in Winter of 2019 and mostly affected middle\u2010aged to elderly people. The virus\u2010infected people might have insufficient vitamin D. In addition, the decreased vitamin D status in calves had been reported to cause the infection of bovine coronavirus.27 Therefore, vitamin D could work as another therapeutic option for the treatment of this novel virus.\n2.1.5 Vitamin E\nVitamin E is a lipid\u2010soluble vitamin and it includes both tocopherols and tocotrienols. Vitamin E plays an important role in reducing oxidative stress through binding to free radicals as an antioxidant.28 Vitamin E deficiency had been reported to intensify the myocardial injury of coxsackievirus B3 (a kind of RNA viruses) infection in mice29 and increased the virulence of coxsackievirus B3 in mice due to vitamin E or selenium deficiency.30 In addition, the decreased vitamin E and D status in calves also caused the infection of bovine coronavirus.27\n2.1.6 Omega\u20103 polyunsaturated fatty acids\nLong\u2010chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) are important mediators of inflammation and adaptive immune responses.31 Omega\u20103 and omega\u20106 PUFAs predominantly promote anti\u2010inflammatory and pro\u2010inflammatory effects. They are precursors of resolvins/protectins and prostaglandins/leukotrienes, respectively.31 Begin et al32 had studied plasma lipids levels in patients with AIDS and had found that a selective and specific lack of the long\u2010chain PUFAs of omega\u20103 series, which are found in high concentrations in fish oils. In addition, protectin D1, the omega\u20103 PUFA\u2010derived lipid mediator, could markedly attenuate influenza virus replication via RNA export machinery. In addition, treatment of protectin D1 with peramivir could completely rescue mice from flu mortality.33 Leu et al34 had found that several PUFAs also had anti\u2010hepatitis C virus (HCV) activities. Therefore, Omega\u20103 including protectin D1, which served as a novel antiviral drug, could be considered for one of the potential interventions of this novel virus, COVID\u201019.\n2.1.7 Selenium\nSelenium is an essential trace element for mammalian redox biology.35 The nutritional status of the host plays a very important role in the defense against infectious diseases.36 Nutritional deficiency impacts not only the immune response but also the viral pathogen itself.10 Dietary selenium deficiency that causes oxidative stress in the host can alter a viral genome so that a normally benign or mildly pathogenic virus can become highly virulent in the deficient host under oxidative stress.10 Deficiency in selenium also induces not only impairment of host immune system, but also rapid mutation of benign variants of RNA viruses to virulence.37 Beck et al38 had reported that selenium deficiency could not only increase the pathology of an influenza virus infection but also drive changes in genome of coxsackievirus, permitting an avirulent virus to acquire virulence due to genetic mutation.39 It is because that selenium could assist a group of enzymes that, in concert with vitamin E, work to prevent the formation of free radicals and prevent oxidative damage to cells and tissues.37 It was reported that synergistic effect of selenium with ginseng stem\u2010leaf saponins could induce immune response to a live bivalent infectious bronchitis coronavirus vaccine in chickens.40 Therefore, selenium supplementation could be an effective choice for the treatment of this novel virus of COVID\u201019.\n2.1.8 Zinc\nZinc is a dietary trace mineral and is important for the maintenance and development of immune cells of both the innate and adaptive immune system.41 Zinc deficiency results in dysfunction of both humoral and cell\u2010mediated immunity and increases susceptibility to infectious diseases.42 Zinc supplement given to zinc\u2010deficient children could reduce measles\u2010related morbidity and mortality caused by lower respiratory tract infections.43 Increasing the concentration of intracellular zinc with zinc\u2010ionophores like pyrithione can efficiently impair the replication of a variety of RNA viruses.44 In addition, the combination of zinc and pyrithione at low concentrations inhibits the replication of SARS coronavirus (SARS\u2010CoV).44 Therefore, zinc supplement may have effect not only on COVID\u201019\u2010related symptom like diarrhea and lower respiratory tract infection, but also on COVID\u201019 itself.\n2.1.9 Iron\nIron is required for both host and pathogen and iron deficiency can impair host immunity, while iron overload can cause oxidative stress to propagate harmful viral mutations.45 Iron deficiency has been reported as a risk factor for the development of recurrent acute respiratory tract infections.46\n2.2 Immunoenhancers\n2.2.1 Interferons\nInterferons (IFNs) have divided into type I and Type II Interferons. As a member of Type I IFN, IFN\u2010\u03b1 is produced very quickly as part of the innate immune response to virus infection. IFN\u2010\u03b1 inhibits the replication of animal and human coronaviruses.47, 48 The investigation in vitro also demonstrated that type I interferons including IFN\u2010\u03b2 could inhibit the replication of SARS\u2010CoV.49 However, interferon\u2010\u03b3 was reported not to possess antiviral activity against SARS coronavirus.50 Kuri et al51 further reported that IFN transcription was blocked in tissue cells infected with SARS\u2010CoV and the cells were able to partially restore their innate immune responsiveness to SARS\u2010CoV after priming with small amounts of IFNs. Moreover, Tan et al had tested the inhibition of SARS coronavirus infection in vitro with clinically approved antiviral drugs. They found that the complete inhibition of cytopathic effects of the virus was observed with specific subtypes (\u03b2\u20101b, \u03b1\u2010n1, \u03b1\u2010n3, and human leukocyte interferon \u03b1) in culture.52 Haagmans et al54 also reported in vivo that pegylated recombinant IFN\u2010\u03b12b, a registered drug for chronic hepatitis C,53 could protect type 1 pneumocytes against SARS coronavirus infection in monkeys (macaques). The drug given at 3 days before infection could reduce viral replication and lung damage as compared with the control monkeys.55 It was also considered as a candidate drug for SARS therapy at that time and the effectiveness of synthetic recombinant IFN\u2010\u03b1 for the treatment of SARS patients was demonstrated in a pilot clinical trial.56 In addition, interferons have also been found to be potent inhibitors of MERS\u2010CoV replication.57 Moreover, the combination of interferon\u2010\u03b1\u20102a with ribavirin was administered to patients with severe MERS\u2010CoV infection and the survival of these patients was improved.57 These findings suggest that these approved IFN's could be also used for the treatment of this novel coronavirus.\n2.2.2 Intravenous gammaglobulin\nIntravenous gammaglobulin (IVIg) was first developed in the late 1970s 58 and is probably the safest immunomodulating drug available for long\u2010term use in all ages. However, it does have adverse reactions. During the SARS outbreak in 2003, IVIg was used extensively in Singapore. However, one\u2010third of critically ill patients developed venous thromboembolism including pulmonary embolism despite the use of low\u2010molecular weight heparin prophylactic.59 It was due to the IVIg\u2010induced increase of viscosity in hypercoagulable states of SARS patients.60\n2.2.3 Thymosin \u03b1\u20101\nThymosin \u03b1\u20101 (Ta1) is a thymic peptide hormone and it has a peculiar ability to restore the homeostasis of the immune system.61 It is was first isolated from thymic tissue in the mid\u2010sixties and it had gained much attention for its immunostimulatory activity.62 It was chemically synthesized and used in diseases where the immune system was hindered or impaired.63 Besides its role in thymocyte development, thymosin \u03b1\u20101 could also increase resistance to glucocorticoid\u2010induced death of the thymocyte.64 Thymosin \u03b1\u20101 could also be used as immune enhancer to SARS patients and it was effective in controlling the spread of the disease.65, 66 Methylprednisolone was often used during the current treatment of COVID\u201019 and the side effect of corticoid\u2010induced death of thymocytes should be considered. So, it is wise to use thymosin \u03b11 before the administration of methylprednisolone.\n2.2.4 Thymopentin\nThymopentin (TP5, munox), a synthetic pentapeptide corresponding to the active site of thymopoietin, had been shown to restore antibody production in old mice.67 Additionally, it could enhance the antibody response in humans when it was applied subcutaneously three times a week at doses of 50\u2009mg.68 Moreover, thymopentin could also be used as an adjuvant treatment for non\u2010responders or hyporesponders to hepatitis B vaccination.69\n2.2.5 Levamisole\nLevamisole, a synthetic low\u2010molecular\u2010weight compound, is the first member of a new class of drugs that can increase the functions of cellular immunity in normal, healthy laboratory animals.70 However, levamisole can act as either an immunostimulant agent or an immunosuppressive agent depending upon the dosing and the timing. So, its clinical use should be carefully taken. Joffe et al71 had reported that levamisole and ascorbic acid treatment in vitro could reverse the depressed helper/inducer subpopulation of lymphocyte in measles. Therefore, the use of levamisole could also be considered for the treatment of COVID\u201019.\n2.2.6 Cyclosporine A\nCyclosporine A is a very important immunosuppressive drug and it has been widely used in transplantation. The emerging use of cyclosporine A has greatly improved the survival rates of patients and grafts after solid\u2010organ transplantation.72 Cyclosporine A is also used for the treatment of autoimmune disorders. Luo et al73 had speculated that nucleocapsid protein (NP) of SARS\u2010CoV played an important role in the process of virus particle assembly and release and it might also bind to human cyclophilin A. Cyclophilin A is a key member of immunophilins acting as a cellular receptor for cyclosporine A.74 Cyclophilin A has played an important role in viral infection which either facilitates or inhibits their replication.74 In addition, the inhibition of cyclophilins by cyclosporine A could block the replication of coronavirus of all genera, including SARS\u2010CoV as well as avian infectious bronchitis virus.75 Therefore, the non\u2010immunosuppressive derivatives of cyclosporine A might serve as broad\u2010range coronavirus inhibitors applicable against the emerging novel virus\u2010like COVID\u201019.\n2.2.7 Chinese medicine\nGlycyrrhizin is an active component of liquorice roots in Chinese medicine. Cinatl et al76 had reported that glycyrrhizin could inhibit the replication of SARS\u2010associated virus in vitro and it had already been suggested as an alternative option for treatment of SARS at that time. Baicalin, another Chinese herb, is a flavonoid which is isolated from Radix Scutellaria. Baicalin was also found to have the ability to inhibit SARS\u2010CoV in vitro.50 Ginseng stem\u2010leaf saponins could highly enhance the specific\u2010antibody responses for Newcastle disease virus and infectious bronchitis virus.40 Therefore, Chinese Medicine could also be considered as a choice to enhance host immunity against the infection of COVID\u201019.\nIn summary, the general treatment for viral infection including nutritional interventions and all kinds of immunoenhancers has been used to enhance host immunity against RNA viral infections. Therefore, they may also be used to fight COVID\u201019 infection by correcting the lymphopenia of patients.3 CORONAVIRUS\u2010SPECIFIC TREATMENTS\n3.1 Coronaviral protease inhibitors\nChymotrypsin\u2010like (3C\u2010like) and papain\u2010like protease (PLP) are coronavirus encoded proteins (Table 2). They have an essential function for coronaviral replication and also have additional function for inhibition of host innate immune responses. Targeting 3C\u2010like protease (3\u2009CLpro) and papain\u2010like protease (PLpro) are more attractive for the treatment of coronavirus.77\nTable 2. Coronavirus\u2010specific treatments\n3.1. Coronavirus protease inhibitors\n3.1.1. Chymotrypsin\u2010like (3C\u2010like) inhibitors\n3.1.1.1. Cinanserin\n3.1.1.2. Flavonoids\n3.1.2. Papain\u2010like protease (PLP) inhibitors\n3.1.2.1.

Promazine\n3.2.5. Nicotianamine\n3.1.1 Chymotrypsin\u2010like (3C\u2010like) inhibitors\nCinanserin\nCinanserin, an old drug, is well\u2010known for serotonin receptor antagonist. It could inhibit the 3 chymotrypsin\u2010like (3C\u2010like) protease and was a promising inhibitor of replication of SARS\u2010CoV.78 The 3CLpro was also been found to be encoded in COVID\u201019.7 Therefore, Cinanserin may be a better choice for the treatment of COVID\u201019 infection.\nFlavonoids\nFlavonoids are an important class of natural products and have several subgroups, which include chalcones, flavones, flavonols, and isoflavones.79 Flavonoids have many functions besides antioxidant effects and they also have antiviral abilities. Shimizu et al80 had found that flavonoids from Pterogyne Nitens could inhibit the entry of the hepatitis C Virus. Jo et al81 had suggested that the anti\u2010coronavirus activity of some flavonoids (Herbacetin, rhoifolin and pectolinarin) was due to the inhibition of 3C\u2010like protease (3CLpro). Other flavonoids (Herbacetin, isobavachalcone, quercetin 3\u2010\u03b2\u2010d\u2010glucoside, and helichrysetin) were also found to be able to block the enzymatic activity of MERS\u2010CoV/3CLpro.82 Moreover, Ryu et al83 had reported that biflavonoids from Torreya nucifera also brought inhibition effect of SARS\u2010CoV/3CL (pro).\n3.1.2 Papain\u2010like protease inhibitors\nPapain\u2010like protease (PLP) of human coronavirus is a novel viral\u2010encoded deubiquitinase and is an IFN antagonist for inhibition of host innate antiviral immune response.\nDiarylheptanoids\nDiarylheptanoids is a natural product and is extracted from the stem bark of Alnus japonica. It had been found to be able to inhibit papain\u2010like protease of SARS\u2010CoV.77\nTherefore, cinanserin together with flavonoids and other natural compounds could be chosen as alternative choices to fight COVID\u201019 infection through targeting coronaviral proteases.\n3.2 Spike (S) protein\u2010angiotensin\u2010converting enzyme\u20102 (ACE2) blockers\nAngiotensin\u2010converting enzyme\u20102 (ACE2) is a type I integral membrane protein which functions as a carboxypeptidase and is the first human homolog of ACE.84 ACE2 efficiently hydrolyzes the potent vasoconstrictor angiotensin II to angiotensin (1\u20107) and it has been implicated in hypertension, cardiac function, heart function, and diabetes.84 In addition, ACE2 is also a functional receptor of SARS\u2010CoV and it mediates virus entry into the cell through binding with spike (S) protein.85, 86 The S protein of SARS\u2010CoV is a type I surface glycoprotein and is responsible for the binding to cellular receptors. In addition, S protein mediates the fusion of viral and host membranes.87 Zhou et al reported that COVID\u201019 used ACE2 as a sole receptor for the entry, but did not use other coronavirus receptors, aminopeptidase N and dipeptidyl peptidase, for the entry. Blocking the binding of S protein to ACE2 is important for the treatment of SARS\u2010CoV infection.88\n3.2.1 Human monoclonal antibody\nSui et al had found one recombinant human monoclonal antibody (mAb) (single\u2010chain variable region fragments, scFvs 80R) against the S1 domain of S protein of SARS\u2010CoV from two nonimmune human antibody libraries. The mAb could efficiently neutralize SARS\u2010CoV and inhibit syncytia formation between cells expressing the S protein and those expressing the SARS\u2010CoV receptor ACE2.89\n3.2.2 Chloroquine\nChloroquine is a 9\u2010aminoquinoline known since 1934. Apart from its well\u2010known antimalarial effects, the drug also has many interesting biochemical properties including antiviral effect. In addition, it had been used against viral infection.90 Moreover, chloroquine was also found to be a potent inhibitor of SARS coronavirus infection through interfering with ACE2, one of cell surface binding sites for S protein of SARS\u2010CoV.91\n3.2.3 Emodin\nEmodin is an anthraquinone compound derived from genus Rheum and Polygonum and it is also a virucidal agent.92 Emodin could significantly block the interaction between the S protein of SARS\u2010CoV and ACE2. Therefore, emodin might abolish SARS\u2010CoV infection by competing for the binding site of S protein with ACE2.93\n3.2.4 Promazine\nPromazine, anti\u2010psychotic drug, shares a similar structure with emodin. It has been found to exhibit a significant effect in inhibiting the replication of SARS\u2010CoV.94 As compared to emodin, promazine exhibited potent inhibition of the binding of S protein to ACE2. These findings suggested that emodin and promazine might be able to inhibit SARS\u2010CoV infectivity through blocking the interaction of S protein and ACE2.93 Therefore, the monoclonal antibody (scFv80R), chloroquine, emodin, and promazine could be used as alternative choices for the treatment of COVID\u201019.\n3.2.5 Nicotianamine\nNicotianamine is an important metal ligand in plants95 and it is found a novel angiotensin\u2010converting enzyme\u20102 inhibitor in soybean.96 So, it is another potential option to be used to reduce the infection of COVID\u201019.4 ANTIVIRAL TREATMENTS\n4.1 Ribavirin\nRibavirin, a broad\u2010spectrum antiviral agent, is routinely used to treat hepatitis C (Table 3). During the outbreak of SARS, ribavirin was used extensively for most cases with or without concomitant use of steroids in Hong Kong.97 However, there was considerable skepticism from overseas and local experts on the efficacy of ribavirin.98 Because there was a report mentioned that ribavirin had no significant activity against SARS\u2010CoV in vitro52 and the use of ribavirin was found to be associated with significant toxicity, including hemolysis (in 76%) and decrease in hemoglobin (in 49%).99 However, Morgenstern et al49 had reported that ribavirin and interferon\u2010\u03b2 synergistically inhibited the replication of SARS\u2010associated coronavirus in animal and human cell lines. In view of adverse reactions and the lack of in vitro efficacy, the use of ribavirin should be seriously considered for the treatment of COVID\u201019, even in combination with other antiviral drugs.\nTable 3. Antiviral treatments and other compounds\n4. Antiviral treatments\n4.1. Ribavirin\n4.2. Lopinavir (LPV)/ritonavir (RTV) (Kaletra)\n4.3. Remdesivir\n4.4. Nelfinavir\n4.5 Arbidol\n4.6. Nitric oxide\n5. Other compounds\n5.1. \u03b1\u2010Lipoic acid\n5.2. Estradiol and phytoestrogen\n5.3. Mucroporin\u2010M1\n4.2 Lopinavir/ritonavir (kaletra)\nThe combination of lopinavir with ritonavir is widely used as a boosted protease inhibitor in the treatment of HIV infection.100 Lopinavir (LPV) is usually combined with ritonavir (RTV) to increase lopinavir half\u2010life through the inhibition of cytochrome P450.101 Chu et al102 had found that the use of LPV/RTV with ribavirin in the treatment of SARS was associated with a better outcome. Kim et al103 had also reported a successful case of MERS\u2010CoV disease treated with triple combination therapy LPV/RTV, ribavirin, and IFN\u2010\u03b12a in South Korea. Regarding this novel virus, COVID\u201019, Kim's triple combination therapy should be considered as an option at the early stage of the disease.\n4.3 Remdesivir\nRemdesivir (RDV), a nucleoside analog GS\u20105734, had been reported to inhibit human and zoonotic coronavirus in vitro and to restrain severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS\u2010CoV) in vivo.104 Recently, the antiviral activity of RDV and IFN\u2010\u03b2 was found to be superior to that of LPV/RTV\u2010IFN\u2010\u03b2 against MERS\u2010CoV in vitro and in vivo.101 In addition, RDV could improve pulmonary function and reduce lung viral loads and severe lung pathology in mice, which was impossible for LPV/RTV\u2010IFN\u2010\u03b2.101 Recently, a first COVID\u201019\u2010infected case was reported in the United States and the use of remdesivir was administered when the patient's clinical status was getting worse.105 Therefore, the use of RDV with IFN\u2010\u03b2 could be a better choice for the treatment of COVID\u201019 comparing with that of the triple combination of LPV/RTV\u2010IFN\u2010\u03b2. However, randomized and controlled trials are still needed to determine the safety and efficacy of remdesivir.\n4.4 Nelfinavir\nNelfinavir is a selective inhibitor of HIV protease, which is responsible for posttranslational processing of HIV propeptides.106 Yamamoto et al107 had found that nelfinavir could strongly inhibit the replication of SARS\u2010CoV. Therefore, nelfinavir could also be an option for the treatment of COVID\u201019.\n4.5 Arbidol\nArbidol (ARB) is a Russian\u2010made small indole\u2010derivative molecule and is licensed in Russia and China for prophylaxis and treatment of influenza and other respiratory viral infections.108 Arbidol had been found to be able to block viral fusion against influenza A and B viruses as well as hepatitis C virus.109 Arbidol could also inhibit hepatitis C virus by blocking hepatitis C virus entry and replication in vitro.110 In addition, arbidol and its derivatives, arbidol mesylate, had been reported to have antiviral activity against the pathogen of SARS in the cell cultures and arbidol mesylate was nearly 5 times as effective as arbidol in reducing the reproduction of SARS virus in the cultured cells.111\n4.6 Nitric oxide\nNitric oxide (NO) is a gas with diverse biological activities and is produced from arginine by NO synthases. NO is able to interact with superoxide, forming peroxynitrite, which, in turn, can mediate bactericidal or cytotoxic reactions.112 In addition, NO had played an important role in regulating airway function and in treating inflammatory airway diseases.113 Rossaint et al114 reported that the beneficial effects of NO inhalation could be observed in most patients with severe acute respiratory distress syndrome. NO was also found to inhibit the synthesis of viral protein and RNA.115 Moreover, Akerstr\u00f6m et al116 had reported that organic NO donor, S\u2010nitroso\u2010N\u2010acetylpenicillamine, could significantly inhibit the replication cycle of SARS\u2010CoV in a concentration\u2010dependent manner. Therefore, the NO inhalation could be also chosen as an option for the treatment of severely COVID\u201019 infected patients.5 OTHER COMPOUNDS\n5.1 \u03b1\u2010Lipoic acid\n\u03b1\u2010Lipoic acid (ALA), a naturally occurring disulfide compound, acts as a cellular coenzyme and has been applied for the treatment of polyneuropathies and hepatic disorders for years (Table 3).117 ALA, as an antioxidant, has played a pivotal role in scavenging free radicals to protect against oxidative damage in several diseases.118 In addition, ALA also had its capability to enhance intracellular glutathione (GSH) levels118 and to normalize the oxidative stress induced by Dexamethasone in chicken.119 Wu et al120 also reported that the oxidative stress in host cells was an important factor in the infectivity of human coronavirus 229E and the glucose\u20106\u2010phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency was another factor that enhanced human coronavirus 229E infection. The addition of \u03b1\u2010lipoic acid to G6PD\u2010knockdown cells could attenuate the increased susceptibility to human coronavirus 229E infection.120 Interestingly, Baur et al121 also found that \u03b1\u2010lipoic acid was effective to inhibit the replication of HIV\u20101. In summary, we speculate that ALA could be also used as an optional therapy for this new virus.\n5.2 Estradiol and phytoestrogen\nFemales, generally, mount more robust immune responses to viral challenges than males, which can result in more efficient virus clearance.122 Epidemiological studies showed that males experiencing a higher rate of incidence and case fatality compared with females after SARS\u2010CoV infection.123, 124 During the MERS outbreak, the disease occurrence rate in men was almost twice as much as in women and the case fatality rate was the same as the occurrence rate among men and women.125 In addition, Channappanavar et al had reported that male mice were more susceptible to SARS\u2010CoV infection compared with age\u2010matched female mice. However, the mortality was increased in female mice when the ovariectomy was done or the estrogen receptor antagonist was given.126 Wei et al127 also found that serum levels of prolactin, follicle\u2010stimulating hormone, and luteinizing hormone of SARS patients were significantly higher than those of control groups, while estradiol (E2), pregnancy hormone, and thyroid\u2010stimulating hormone were considerably lower than those of normal controls. Interestingly, estrogenic compounds had been found to reduce influenza A virus replication in primary human nasal epithelial cells derived from female, but not male, donors.128 In addition, resveratrol, a phytoestrogen from grape seeds and red wine, had been reported to be a potent anti\u2010MERS agent in vitro.129 Therefore, 17\u03b2\u2010Estradiol or phytoestrogen could also be an alternative option to be considered for the treatment of COVID\u201019.\n5.3 Mucroporin\u2010M1\nMucroporin\u2010M1 is a scorpion venom\u2010derived peptide and has broad\u2010spectrum virucidal activity against many viruses including measles, influenza H5N1 viruses, and SARS\u2010CoV.130 Therefore, this peptide could also be used for the treatment of COVID\u201019 infection as well as the new drug design to target COVID\u201019.6 CONCLUSION\nIn this review, we summarize all the potential interventions for COVID\u201019 infection according to previous treatments of SARS and MERS. We have found that the general treatments are very important to enhance host immune response against RNA viral infection. The immune response has often been shown to be weakened by inadequate nutrition in many model systems as well as in human studies. However, the nutritional status of the host, until recently, has not been considered as a contributing factor to the emergence of viral infectious diseases. Therefore, we propose to verify the nutritional status of COVID\u201019 infected patients before the administration of general treatments. In addition, we also found coronavirus\u2010specific treatments and antiviral treatments were very useful for the treatment of SARS and MERS. They should also be considered as potential treatments for COVID\u201019 infection. The other compounds should also be chosen as alternative options for the treatment as well as new drug designs.\nTo complete the eradication of virus infection, the COVID\u201019\u2010related vaccines are warranted. The vaccine development for SARS had already attracted the attention of many scientists in the past. Avian IBV is similar to SARS\u2010CoV and both viruses belong to coronavirus. IBV is in group 3 and SARS belongs to group 4.131 Bijlenga et al55 had suggested that avian live virus IBV vaccine (strain H) be used to treat SARS in 2005. However, preliminary tests in monkeys should be taken before the startup. Interestingly, children are seldom attacked by COVID\u201019 as well as SARS\u2010CoV. It may be due to the required vaccine program for every child. The RNA\u2010virus vaccines and the adjuvants in vaccine programs may help children escape from the infection. Therefore, the RNA\u2010virus\u2010related vaccines including measles (MeV), polio, Japanese encephalitis virus, influenza virus, and rabies\u2010related vaccines, could be used as the most promising alternative choices to prevent human\u2010to\u2010human transmission through immunizing health care workers and noninfected population as well.\nRecombinant measles vaccine expressing S protein of SARS and MERS were also tried by many researchers. Escriou et al132 had generated live\u2010attenuated recombinant measles vaccine candidates expressing the membrane\u2010anchored S protein of SARS\u2010CoV (SARS\u2010CoV\u2010S\u2010vaccine) and they had found that the vaccine could induce highest titers of neutralizing antibodies and protected immunized animals from intranasal infectious challenge with SARS\u2010CoV. Bodmer et al133 had reported that two live\u2010attenuated measles virus vaccines either expressing S protein or N protein of MERS\u2010CoV could induce robust and multifunctional T cell responses in the mouse model. Frantz et al134 also mentioned that recombinant measles vaccine could induce stronger and T helper 1\u2010biased responses.\nRegarding short\u2010term protection and prevention of viral infection, passive immunotherapy should not be neglected.135 Monoclonal antibody therapy is one of the best forms of passive immunotherapy. A human IgG1 mAb, CR3014, had been generated and it had been found to be reactive with whole inactivated SARS coronavirus. In addition, CR3014 could be used as prophylaxis for SARS coronavirus infection in ferrets.136 However, CR3014 was found to be able to block the interaction in parent SARS\u2010CoV strain, but not in escape variants. This led to the ineffectiveness of CR3014 to prevent infection in humans. CR3022 was another monoclonal antibody and it had been found to neutralize CR3014 escape viruses.136 The combination of CR3014 and CR3022 had also been reported to have the potential to control immune escape.135 However, the clinical trial of CR3022 with CR3014 had never been tried due to the high cost of manufacturing.\nConvalescent plasma can also be called passive immunotherapy. It is usually chosen when there are no specific vaccines or drugs available for emerging infection\u2010related diseases.137 Arabi et al had tested the feasibility of convalescent plasma therapy as well as its safety and clinical efficacy in critically ill MERS patients. They found that convalescent plasma had an immunotherapeutic potential for the treatment of MERS\u2010CoV infection.138 In addition, convalescent plasma from recovered SARS patients had also been reported to be useful clinically for treating other SARS patients.139, 140 Importantly, the use of convalescent plasma or serum was also suggested by the World Health Organization under Blood Regulators Network when vaccines and antiviral drugs were unavailable for an emerging virus. In summary, these findings suggest that the current children's RNA\u2010virus\u2010related vaccines are the best alternative methods to be used to vaccinate the uninfected people and health care workers. Convalescent plasma should be routinely used for the treatment of COVID\u201019 infected critically sick patients if it is available. The avian IBV vaccine is also another choice for clinical trials if its safety has been approved in monkeys. Therefore, we suggest that all the potential interventions be implemented to control the emerging COVID\u201019 if the infection is uncontrollable.CONFLICT OF INTERESTS\nThe authors declare that there are no conflict of interests.", "25781": "1 INTRODUCTION\nOn December 2019, a cluster of cases of novel pneumonia emerged in Wuhan, China.1, 2 On 7 January 2020, Chinese health authorities confirmed that this cluster was associated with a novel coronavirus. This novel coronavirus was named as \u201ccoronavirus disease 2019\u201d (COVID\u201019) by the World Health Organization on February 11. The clinical characteristics of COVID\u201019 related pneumonia patients have been shown in recent studies.1-5 Common symptoms at the onset of illness included fever, cough, and fatigue or myalgia. Organ dysfunction included acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), acute cardiac injury, acute liver injury, acute kidney injury, and death could occur in severe cases.1-4 Computed tomography (CT) images demonstrated typical radiographic features including ground\u2010glass opacities (GGOs), multifocal patchy consolidation, and/or interstitial changes with a peripheral distribution.6, 7\nInfluenza virus, a common virus often occurring in winter as well, appears to be similar to COVID\u201019 in terms of transmission characteristics.8, 9 The common clinical manifestations of patients with influenza virus included fever, cough, rhinitis, sore throat, headache, dyspnea, myalgia, and radiographic evidence of pneumonia, which are similar to those of COVID\u201019 patients.9, 10 The typical chest CT presentations for influenza virus pneumonia are also similar to those for COVID\u201019, including GGO, consolidation, and pleural effusion.11, 12\nIn the clinic, we found that a few patients diagnosed with COVID\u201019 were also infected with the influenza virus. However, to the best of our knowledge, the clinical characteristics of patients who were coinfected with COVID\u201019 and influenza virus have not been discussed, and that is the focus of this study.2 METHODS\n2.1 Patients\nThe patients who were both infected with the influenza virus and COVID\u201019 were enrolled from Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology. These case series were approved by the Ethics Commission of Tongji Hospital. Oral consent was obtained from each patient. We always followed the most up\u2010to\u2010date version of the guidelines of diagnosis and treatment of pneumonitis caused by the novel coronavirus, which were promulgated by the National Health Commission of China. Therefore, multiple versions including the fourth, the fifth, and the sixth have been used for these 115 patients.13 The influenza virus diagnosis in this study was built on the serology.\n2.2 Data collection\nMedical history, clinical symptoms, laboratory findings, chest CT scans, and treatment and outcomes data were obtained with standardized data collection forms. The collected data were also independently reviewed and checked by two reviewers. To minimize the recall and sampling deviations is to communicate with the patients effectively and double\u2010check with them.\n2.3 Statistical analysis\nThe data were analyzed using the IBM SPSS, version 19 (SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL) and GraphPad Prism version 5.00 (GraphPad Software, La Jolla). All statistical data were presented as meaning\u2009\u00b1\u2009SEM.3 RESULTS\n3.1 Presenting characteristics when admitted\nIn this study, we found that 5 patients also got infected with the influenza virus among 115 inpatients confirmed with COVID\u201019 infection, an incidence rate of about 4.35%. Three cases infected with influenza A virus (60%), and the other two cases infected with influenza B virus (40%) among the five patients. The clinical characteristics of patients at admission are given in Table 1. The age of these five patients (two males and three females) ranged from 39 to 66 years (50.20\u2009\u00b1\u20099.83). The past medical history of each patient is also shown in Table 1. Common symptoms at onset of illness included fever (five [100%] patients), cough (five [100%] patients), shortness of breath (five [100%] patients), myalgia (two [40%] patients), fatigue (two [40%] patients), headache (two [40%] patients), chest pain (one [20%] patient), nasal tampon (three [60%] patients), expectoration (two [40%] patients), pharyngalgia (three [60%] patients), and hemoptysis (one [20%] patient) (Table 1). The main laboratory results at the time of admission are shown in Table 2. Compared to the reference range, the patients' lymphocyte levels were reduced (four [80%] patients). Liver alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels (two [40%] patients and two [40%] patients), C\u2010reactive protein (CRP) levels (four [80%] patients), and procalcitonin levels (two [40%] patients) were increased. But the patients' white blood cell count, albumin, renal function indicators (creatinine and blood urea nitrogen), and coagulation function (prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time, and D\u2010dimer) were normal.\nTable 1.

According to the patient's disease progression, the data were presented in three stages, including the admission stage, progression stage, and remission stage (Figure 1). The laboratory parameters included white blood cell count, neutrophil count, lymphocyte count, ALT, albumin, creatinine, abd CRP. We found that only one patient presented a higher white blood cell count during the progression stage than the upper limit of the reference range (one [20%] patient). The neutrophil count of two patients exceeded the upper limit of the reference range during the progression phase (two [40%] patients). Four of five patients showed a lower lymphocyte count than the lower limit of the reference range during progression stages (four [80%] patients). Lymphocytes then increased during the remission phase and even exceeded the lower limit of the reference range. Liver function ALT of three patients (three [60%] patients) rose above the upper limit of the reference range during the progression of pneumonia, which was more significant than those in the admission stage. Four of the five patients had an albumin reduction during the disease progression (four [80%] patients), and three of these four patients even had the albumin count below the lower limit of the reference range. Renal function was normal during the admission and progression stages. The inflammation indicator CRP exceeded the upper limit of the reference range during the entire course of the disease, but the highest value was only 31.9\u2009mg/L.\nFigure 1\nOpen in figure viewerPowerPoint\nThe dynamic profile of laboratory findings in patients coexisting with COVID\u201019 and influenza virus infection.

Pulmonary lesions in all the patients gradually relieved after an exacerbation (see Figure 2). According to the CT characteristics, the duration from the onset of the illness to the remission stage in the five patients was 16, 39, 28, 21, and 24 days (25.6\u2009\u00b1\u20098.68), respectively. The days for the hospital stay were 14, 30, 17, 12, and 19 days (28.4\u2009\u00b1\u20097.02), respectively.\n3.3 The main complications, main interventions, and outcomes for the patients coexisting with COVID\u201019 and influenza virus infection\nDuring the pneumonia progression, the main complications are reported in Table 3. We found that only one of five patients had ARDS (one [20%] patient) and the patient's hypoxia gradually recovered by using noninvasive assisted ventilation. In addition, three of the five patients (three [60%] patients) had an abnormal liver function, with the most severe case showing an ALT value of 109\u2009U/L, and all patients had no jaundice. Two of the five patients (two [40%] patients) had diarrhea during the treatment period.\nTable 3.

Some reports have shown that COVID\u201019 can cause serious, sometimes fatal, pneumonia.3-5 The outbreak of COVID\u201019 pneumonia in Wuhan began in December 2019, and this is also the time when the influenza virus occurred. Transmission characteristics and onset time of influenza virus appear to be of similar magnitude to COVID\u201019.8 Therefore, the evidence suggested that the patients may have coinfection with COVID\u201019 and influenza virus.\nIn this report, we found that 5 patients coinfected with influenza virus among 115 pneumonia patients confirmed with COVID\u201019. Similar to the patients with COVID\u201019 infection, the patients coinfected with COVID\u201019 and influenza virus also have symptoms such as fever, cough, fatigue, and headache. However, in this report, we found that three of five patients had nasal tampon and pharyngalgia (60%), which are not a frequent symptom of COVID\u201019 patients. When these two symptoms appeared, it was generally considered that a common cold or influenza virus infection may occur. Therefore, they may be a reminder to those who had nasal tampon and pharyngalgia symptoms not to ignore the possibility of COVID\u201019 infection, if possible, to keep themselves isolated from the rest of the families. Another patient had mild hemoptysis, which was not a common symptom of COVID\u201019 infection, and he recovered after taking the hemostatic medicine for three days. It was found that two of five patients developed diarrhea during the disease progression stage, which may be caused by drugs, such as oseltamivir, or COVID\u201019 infection, which could be detected in stool samples of patients with abdominal symptoms.14\nIn addition, we found that all the patients' leukocytes were in the reference range during the admission phase, while one patient's leukocytes exceeded the upper limit of the reference range during the progression phase. The lymphocytes of patients are below the lower limit of the reference range during the admission and progression stages and can gradually rise during the remission stage, which may be associated with cellular immune deficiency. Liver ALT and AST and CRP may show mild abnormalities. Patients' albumin often declined as the disease progressed, even reaching a point of being below the lower limit of the reference range. No abnormal renal function was noticed throughout the whole process. These laboratory findings above were similar to those previously reported in patients with only COVID\u201019 infection.3, 4 As for the patient's dynamic CT scan images, one patient had significant bilateral GGO and subsegmental areas of consolidation, which corresponded to the clinical manifestations of the patient. The patient had ARDS, relying on the noninvasive respiratory ventilation, and required the longest period of treatment in the hospital. Through the analysis of the image characteristics of the five patients, it seemed that there was no significant difference from that of pneumonia patients infected with only COVID\u201019.\nAs for the perspective of patient complications, all the patients showed shortness of breath, and only one patient developed ARDS without shock, acute myocardial injury, and abnormal renal function. Severe illness occurred in 15.7% of the patients with COVID\u201019 after admission to a hospital,5 which suggested that patients who coinfected COVID\u201019 and influenza virus did not significantly worsen the condition. Until now, no specific treatment has been recommended for coronavirus infection except for meticulous supportive care.15 As for the therapy methods, the patients did not receive invasive ventilator, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation treatment, and ICU care. All patients were given oxygen inhalation, plus oseltamivir and other antiviral drugs. All the patients in this study received antibacterial agents. All patients recovered and were discharged without death.\nOn one hand, this study showed that the clinical characteristics of patients with both COVID\u201019 and influenza virus infection were similar to those of COVID\u201019 infection, but the symptoms of nasal tampon and pharyngalgia may be more prone to appear, which would be more convinced when more cases included. According to the laboratory findings, imaging studies, and patient prognosis, those coinfection patients did not appear to experience a more severe situation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that a comparison of the clinical manifestation between the coinfection patients and the patients infected with COVID\u201019 only. It is noted that additional cases and more clinical information will enable making more comprehensive and solid conclusions.\nOn the other hand, the report reminded us that it is critical to pay attention to the potential coinfection with other respiratory viruses for the COVID\u201019 infection patients, which effectively helps us to prevent the aggravation of disease progression and even death for patients. We cannot ignore COVID\u201019 infection patients might combine with other respiratory viruses, not just the influenza virus, to make sure that we could provide the best and the most comprehensive treatment to the patients.ACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThis study is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 81572422, 81700515).CONFLICT OF INTERESTS\nThe authors declare that there are no conflict of interests.", "25763": "1 INTRODUCTION\nIn December 2019, a group of patients with pneumonia of unknown cause were confirmed to be infected with the 2019\u2010novel coronavirus (2019\u2010nCoV) in Hubei, China.1-3 Initially, it was reported that most patients had visited local seafood markets in Wuhan city, the provincial capital of Hubei, China. Shortly thereafter, there was a large increase in the number of patients who had not been to the seafood market, suggesting human\u2010to\u2010human transmission of 2019\u2010nCoV.4 Pneumonia caused by this coronavirus was subsequently identified as a novel acute respiratory infectious disease and was named coronavirus disease (COVID\u201019) by the World Health Organization (WHO) on 11 February 2020.\n2019\u2010nCoV shares over 79% of its genome sequence with the coronavirus that causes severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS\u2010CoV), a member of the subgenus Sarbecovirus (Beta\u2010CoV lineage B); owing to the overall similarity between both viruses, 2019\u2010nCoV was renamed to SARS\u2010CoV\u20102.5 Based on the available evidence, it appears that SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 can be transmitted by asymptomatic carriers, which contributes to its basic reproduction number (R0) and pandemic potential.6, 7 In addition to the high R0 of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102, the convenience of modern means of transportation further enhance its global spread. COVID\u201019 is still spreading rapidly in China and globally, with 80\u2009993 confirmed cases and 2761 deaths as of 26 February 2020. COVID\u201019 has become a public health emergency of international concern, and several Asian and European countries (such as Japan and Italy) are registering increases in the number of infected patients.8, 9\nWith the increase in the number of confirmed cases outside of Hubei, emergency departments (EDs) and fever clinics around the world are having to accommodate a large number of patients. Preliminary diagnosis based on initial clinical features may contribute to disease control and prevention of further infection, especially in areas with limited access to rapid nucleic acid amplification tests.10 However, in a recent report by Li, COVID\u201019 patients outside Hubei exhibited relatively mild symptoms, indicating that the severity of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection is variable.11 Chest computed tomography (CT) has a high diagnostic value in the evaluation of COVID\u201019 patients. However, severe lung abnormalities are only apparent on chest CT scans approximately 10 days after the onset of symptoms.12 This poses a challenge for the early diagnosis and intervention in patients with suspected COVID\u201019 in the ED until a confirmation is obtained through real\u2010time reverse\u2010transcription polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis. Currently, limited data regarding the initial clinical features of COVID\u201019 from EDs outside of Hubei are available. Here, we describe the initial clinical features (including epidemiological characteristics, symptoms, laboratory results, and CT findings) of patients with suspected COVID\u201019 in an Anhui province ED, to provide insights into the preliminary diagnosis of COVID\u201019 in ED outside of Hubei, China.2 MATERIALS AND METHODS\n2.1 Patients\nThis retrospective study focused on the initial clinical features of patients with suspected COVID\u201019 who presented to the ED of the First Affiliated Hospital of USTC and the Infectious Hospital of the First Affiliated Hospital of USTC for the first time between 24 January 2020 and 20 February 2020. Patients were considered as suspected to have COVID\u201019 based on symptoms, exposure history, and guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of pneumonia caused by novel coronavirus infection (trial version III) published by the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China.13 All suspected patients were admitted in quarantined observing rooms in ED. A nucleic acid amplification test was performed on swab specimens from patients with suspected disease at admission. Patients with a positive diagnosis were admitted to the hospital, while patients with a negative initial result were kept in quarantine and underwent a second nucleic acid test after 24\u2009hours; of these, patients with a second negative result on the nucleic acid test were considered to not have an infection and were discharged from the hospital once they tested negative for SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 antigens on two consecutive tests.\nThe present study sample consisted of 116 patients, 32 of whom were diagnosed with SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection. This study was approved by the ethics committee of the First Affiliated Hospital of USTC and Infectious Hospital of the First Affiliated Hospital of USTC.\nThe inclusion criteria were (a) patients defined as suspected SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection based on guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of pneumonia caused by novel coronavirus infection (trial version III), (b) presentation to, clinical observation and quarantine in our ED and (c) nucleic acid amplification test performed in our ED. The exclusion criteria were (a) transfer from another hospital or previous visit to our hospital and (b) previous diagnosis of COVID\u201019.\n2.2 Data collection\nThe date of illness onset and duration of observation were collected for each patient. Epidemiological data were collected from brief interviews with the patient. Several investigators interviewed each suspected patient on admission to collect exposure histories during the 2 weeks before illness onset. All interviews were performed before an ultimate diagnosis was made. Clinical and laboratory data on admission were obtained from detailed medical records, collected in a standardized case report form by two experienced emergency doctors. Clinical data collected included demographic characteristics, symptoms of infection (such as cough, expectoration, chest pain, and weakness) and presence of comorbidities. Laboratory tests included a complete blood count, serum biochemistry, interleukin\u20106 (IL\u20106) test, creatine kinase test, lactate dehydrogenase test, and tests for the identification of other respiratory pathogens. Chest CT examinations were performed upon ED admission in all patients with suspected disease. Two certified chest radiologists independently reviewed the CT images while blinded to the names and clinical data of the patients. Not all patients presented at the same infection stage and some data were missing; thus, data could not be integrated.\n2.3 Statistical analysis\nSPSS Statistics 20 (IBM Corp, Armonk, New York) was used for statistical analysis. Continuous variables were assessed as either means and standard deviations or medians with interquartile ranges (IQR). For categorical variables, the percentages of patients in each category were calculated.3 RESULTS\n3.1 Epidemiological characteristics\nIn total, 116 patients with the suspected disease were included in the study. Thirty\u2010two patients were confirmed to have COVID\u201019 and referred to as \u201cdiagnosed patients\u201d; the remaining 84 patients were referred to as \u201cnegative cases.\u201d The median age for diagnosed patients was 46 years, and 35 years for negative cases (Table 1). There was a slight female predominance in both groups. There were 6 (19%) smokers among diagnosed patients and 13 (15%) among negative cases. Seven (22%) diagnosed and 15 (18%) negative cases had hypertension. Four (13%) diagnosed and 6 (7%) negative cases had diabetes. There were no other commonly found comorbidities in either group. There was no specific exposure history common to all patients with suspected disease: 8 (25%) diagnosed patients had visited Wuhan in the previous 2 weeks and 12 (38%) had been exposed to patients with infection in the previous 2 weeks. In negative cases, these numbers were 7 (20%) and 8 (24%), respectively. None of the patients had a history of exposure to the seafood market in Wuhan. Median time from illness onset to ED admission for all patients with the suspected disease was 5 (IQR, 2\u20107), 5 (IQR,4\u20107), and 4 (IQR,1\u20109) for all patients, diagnosed patients, and negative cases, respectively.\nTable 1.

The cough was the second most commonly observed symptom, found in 21 (66%) diagnosed patients and in 52 (62%) negative cases. Myalgia or fatigue seemed more common in diagnosed patients (16%) than in negative cases (7%). Although the number of negative cases (17) with expectoration was twice as high as that of diagnosed patients (5), the prevalence of expectoration was 20% and 16%, respectively. Chest congestion was noted in 3 (9%) diagnosed patients and 2 (2%) negative cases. Only 1 (1%) undiagnosed patient had hemoptysis. One (3%) of the diagnosed and 2 (2%) of the negative cases had a headache, while 1 (3%) diagnosed and 1 (1%) negative cases had diarrhea. Among the 32 diagnosed patients, the average highest temperatures on the 1st and 2nd days in the ED were 37.3\u2009\u00b1\u20090.8\u00b0C and 37.7\u2009\u00b1\u20090.8\u00b0C, respectively; the 1st\u2010day values ranged from 36\u00b0C to 39.2\u00b0C and the 2nd\u2010day values ranged from 36.4\u00b0C to 39.4\u00b0C. Among the 84 negative cases, the average highest temperatures on the 1st and 2nd days in the ED were 37.1\u2009\u00b1\u20090.7\u00b0C and 37\u2009\u00b1\u20090.6\u00b0C, respectively; the 1st\u2010day values ranged from 36\u00b0C to 39.4\u00b0C and the 2nd\u2010day values ranged from 36.2\u00b0C to 38.9\u00b0C.\n3.3 Laboratory tests\nLaboratory tests on admission showed that 7 (22%) diagnosed and 4 (5%) negative cases had leukopenia (white blood cell count <3.5\u2009\u00d7\u2009109/L), 3 (9%) diagnosed and 16 (19%) negative cases had neutrophilia (neutrophil count >6.3\u2009\u00d7\u2009109/L) and 19 (59%) diagnosed and 24 (29%) negative cases had lymphopenia (lymphocyte count <1.1\u2009\u00d7\u2009109/L) (Table 2). Ten (31%) diagnosed and 29 (35%) negative cases had decreased lymphocyte percentages. Increased D\u2010dimer levels were observed in 3 (9%) diagnosed and 9 (11%) negative cases. In terms of sensitive indicators of infection, increased procalcitonin levels were found only in 5 (6%) negative cases. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) was elevated in 16 (50%) diagnosed patients and 16 (19%) negative cases. Increased C\u2010reactive protein (CRP) levels were confirmed in 21 (66%) diagnosed and 40 (48%) negative cases, while IL\u20106 levels were elevated in 7 (22%) diagnosed and 7 (8%) negative cases. The results of these indicators were not integrated, owing to different infection stages and missing data.\nTable 2.

Most diagnosed patients (30/32, 94%) and 56 (67%) negative cases had pneumonia (Table 3). Bilateral involvement was seen in most diagnosed patients (29 out of 32, 91%) and 34 (40%) negative cases. Ground\u2010glass opacity (GGO) was identified on chest CT in 15 (47%) diagnosed and 10 (12%) negative cases; Only 4 (13%) of the diagnosed patients had a spider web pattern visible on CT images. Only 1 (3%) diagnosed patient showed spider web and crazy\u2010paving patterns on chest CT. No negative cases developed any of these patterns or symptoms upon admission. Among some patients with suspected disease, similar CT findings were found in both diagnosed and negative cases upon admission (Figure 1).\nTable 3.

She was undiagnosed with COVID\u2010194 DISCUSSION\nAnhui is adjacent to Hubei and a large population migrates between the two provinces. As in other regions, secondary transmission of imported cases in the population rapid grows after imposed traffic control in Hubei since 23 January 2020. It is unclear whether the clinical characteristics of suspected cases are similar to those of the original cases in Hubei and whether there are differences in the initial clinical features after secondary transmission. In this study, we reported the initial clinical findings of 116 patients with suspected COVID\u201019 who presented in EDs and fever clinics for the first time. In total, 32 patients were eventually diagnosed with SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection (\u201cdiagnosed patients\u201d). Similar to the confirmed cases in Hubei, the patients who were eventually found to be infected were older than the ones who were not infected: most diagnosed patients were middle\u2010aged or older adults and most negative cases were young or middle\u2010aged patients.14 However, patients of all age groups have been found to be infected with SARS\u2010CoV\u20102, and the proportion of older adults among diagnosed and negative cases was similar. Smokers were equally distributed in both groups, indicating that smoking is not a specific risk factor for diagnosed patients.\nThe median time from illness onset to ED admission was 5 (interquartile range ([IQR]: 2\u20107), 5 (IQR: 4\u20107) and 4 (IQR: 1\u20109) days for all patients, diagnosed patients and negative cases, respectively. Fever (84%), cough (66.0%), myalgia and fatigue (16.0%) were the most common symptoms in diagnosed patients, while fever (68%), cough (62.0%) and expectoration (20%) were the most common in negative cases. More than half of the diagnosed patients showed a decreased lymphocyte count (59%) and increased ESR (50%) and CRP (66%) levels.\nHaving initial clinical symptoms, fever being the most common is the main reason for visiting the ED.15 In our study, fever and cough were the most common symptoms observed in all patients with suspected disease. Due to the high seasonal incidence of respiratory diseases, these were not atypical manifestations. At the same time, not all patients with suspected disease in our study presented with high temperature when they first visited the ED, despite claims of fever symptoms. This may be attributed to the use of over\u2010the\u2010counter antipyretic drugs. On the 2nd day of clinical quarantine and observation in the ED, febrile symptoms were more accentuated among diagnosed patients, likely due to strict control of antipyretic drugs imposed by physicians, but this observation requires further confirmation. It should also be noted that fever and cough are not present in all confirmed cases, especially outside of Hubei. Similar to previous reports, we found that the initial clinical manifestations tended to be mild in Anhui.11 There were also diagnosed patients who only presented with myalgia or fatigue, headache, and chest tightness who require additional vigilance from emergency physicians.\nA history of exposure is often a reason for suspected patients to visit the ED. A large number of patients with suspected disease visited the ED during the current outbreak to seek confirmation or exclusion of COVID\u201019, due to potential exposure history and exhibiting clinical symptoms associated with SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection. In our study, more than half of the diagnosed patients (63%) had a specific history of exposure to Hubei or infected patients in the previous 2 weeks. In other words, 37% of the diagnosed patients did not a specific history of exposure to Hubei. About a third (32%) of negative cases also had a history of exposure, such as staying in Wuhan/Hubei. Therefore, a specific history of exposure to Hubei or infected patients no longer seems to be a requisite for patients with the suspected disease to be diagnosed with COVID\u201019, likely due to the increase in secondary infection of imported patients and potential undefined exposure to infected patients. We found objective clinical findings such as laboratory tests and chest CT findings in diagnosed patients with a definite exposure history were relatively specific than those without exposure history (Table 4). This may account for changes in the characteristics of the virus in secondary infections or potential infections. According to recent reports, SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 has been detected in the tears and conjunctival secretions of diagnosed patients.16 Since the exact infection route is still not completely understood, even if patients deny a specific exposure history, potential unknown exposure can interfere with the judgment of ED physicians.\nTable 4.

Bilateral involvement and GGO may be the initial characteristics found in chest CT scans of diagnosed patients, consistent with a previous study where GGO was found to be the main radiological finding distributed in the lower lobes (unilaterally or bilaterally) in the initial stage, up to 4 days after onset of symptoms; however, these characteristics were not unique for diagnosed patients.12, 19 In our study, spider web and crazy\u2010paving patterns were exclusively observed among diagnosed patients; these patients were at a later infection stage, with a median number of 8 days since illness onset.\nWith the number of cases outside Hubei increasing, it is likely that EDs around the world will continue to receive large numbers of patients with the suspected disease for a long time until the outbreak is effectively controlled. Based on our experience, we recommend strict medical quarantine and observation for all patients with the suspected disease until the results of nucleic acid amplification tests from throat swabs, sputum, and even lung lavage are obtained.20 In under\u2010resourced regions, where nucleic acid amplification tests are lacking or delayed, strict medical quarantine and observation in the ED or dedicated quarantine facilities (until typical clinical symptoms and CT characteristics emerge) may contribute to disease control and prevention of further infection. The psychological impact of quarantine should also be taken into account by physicians.21\nOur study has several limitations. First, it is a retrospective descriptive study with a limited number of patients. Although all suspected patients were enrolled according to the guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of pneumonia caused by novel coronavirus infection (trial version III) published by the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China. Suspected patients not covered by the guidelines or not typical may not be admitted, resulting in a bias. In addition, the patients were only from the Anhui province; it is possible that other initial clinical features related to COVID\u201019 are observed outside Anhui and Hubei. Second, due to different times from illness onset to admission, and an incomplete collection of data, there was a lack of rigorous grouping and effective statistical analysis. Moreover, the time since illness onset might be shorter than the observation period of 10 days, which could result in biases of clinical observation characteristics.5 CONCLUSION\nThe initial clinical features of patients suspected of having COVID\u201019 in EDs outside Hubei were relatively mild. Definite exposure history to Hubei or infected patients may not be a requisite for diagnosis. Meanwhile, diagnosed patients without definite exposure history tend to show more atypical initial clinical features. Although we found differences in the initial clinical features of patients eventually confirmed to be infected, those differences were not specific and it seems far\u2010fetched to use them as a basis of early clinical diagnosis of COVID\u201019. For emergency physicians, a combination of epidemiological features, laboratory tests, and chest CT findings may be necessary to confirm the presence of infection. Nevertheless, we recommend strict medical quarantine and observation of all patients with suspected COVID\u201019 in the ED or dedicated quarantine facilities, irrespective of initial clinical features, especially in under\u2010resourced regions where rapid nucleic acid amplification tests are lacking.CONFLICT OF INTERESTS\nThe authors declare that there are no conflict of interests.AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS\nZW and XK prepared and drafted the manuscript; XL conceived and designed the study; LH collected the data; XL, ZS, and FS read, corrected, and approved the final manuscript.

However, epidemiological investigation shows that the new infectors had a history of close contact with confirmed SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 patients.5 The laboratory examinations (including blood routine examination, C\u2010reactive protein [CRP], lymphocyte subpopulations, and SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 RNA), as well as the chest computed tomography (CT) examination, play an important role in diagnosis, treatment, and assessment.6 Although several approved antiviral drugs including lopinavir and ritonavir, interferon, arbidol, ribavirin, and chloroquine phosphate are used for empirical antiviral therapy, the use of combination therapy of traditional Chinese and western medicine is also recommended.7 Currently, information regarding the clinical diagnosis and treatment of COVID\u201019 caused by SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 is scarce.8 In this study, the epidemiologic history, clinical diagnosis, and treatment, as well as the changes of clinical characteristics before, during and after treatment of nine cases of COVID\u201019 are reported.2 MATERIALS AND METHODS\n2.1 Patient\nThe clinical data of nine cases infected with the SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 were analyzed retrospectively. Four cases (3#, 4#, 5#, and 8#) disclosed that they had returned to their hometown from epidemic\u2010hit Wuhan. One case (9#) stated a history of direct contact with a fellow villager from a key epidemic\u2010hit Wuhan. There are two cases (6# and 7#) of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection with the familial aggregation. However, it is unknown how the two cases (1# and 2#) without the above\u2010mentioned epidemiologic history were infected. Two cases (1# and 3#) have a history of smoking for more than 20 years, while others have no history of smoking. Written informed consent was obtained from patients for using clinical records in this study.\n2.2 Laboratory tests\nNasopharyngeal swab specimens were collected according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines.9 Reverse transcription\u2010polymerase chain reaction was employed to detect the obtained nasopharyngeal swab specimens. Three pairs of primers were designed to target three genes including RdRP, E, and N. The positive expression of the three genes, or RdRP and E genes, or RdRP and N genes indicates SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 is positive.10 Diagnostic kit for immunoglobulin M antibodies to Mycoplasma pneumoniae, adenovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, influenza A and B viruses, parainfluenza viruses type 1, 2, and 3, and Chlamydia pneumoniae was used for detecting nine kinds of common respiratory pathogens. The subpopulations of lymphocytes including CD3+ T cells, CD3+CD4+ T cells, CD3+CD8+ T cells, CD3+CD4+ T cells, CD4/CD8 ratio were detected by flow cytometry. Other laboratory tests were implemented as well.3 RESULTS\n3.1 Clinical symptoms before treatment\nGenerally, nine patients were in good health before hospitalization. Before treatment, the various clinical symptoms were reported. Most cases had fevers (range from 37.4\u00b0C to 39.3\u00b0C) except for case 7#. With the exception of cases 6# and 7#, seven cases had a slight or severe cough with or without phlegm. Only two cases (3# and 8#) of these patients had occasional chest tightness but no chest pain. Notably, cases 1# and 2# had severe or slight diarrhea, respectively but no abdominal pain, while others had no gastrointestinal symptoms.\nThe laboratory reports of these patients before, during and after treatment are shown (Table 1). Except for significantly decreased white\u2010cell count (WBC) and absolute neutrophil count (ANC) in case 2#, others had basically normal or slightly decreased WBC and ANC throughout the clinical course. The absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) was low, as well as the obviously decreased percentage of lymphocyte subpopulations (including CD3+ cells, CD3+CD4+ cells, and CD3+CD8+ cells) were observed in case 1# before treatment. The absolute number and the proportion of these cells gradually returned to normal levels during and after treatment. Notably, the ALC was obviously decreased during treatment but back to normal level after treatment compared with those before treatment in cases 3# and 9#. It was observed that CRP was obviously increased in cases 1#, 3#, and 9# before treatment, which gradually recovered to normal level during and after treatment. However, procalcitonin (PCT) had no clinically significant changes in all cases. Both of the arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO2) and oxygen (pO2) in cases 1# and 9# were obviously decreased before treatment according to the existing records. With the exception of the significantly elevated lactic dehydrogenase in cases 1#, 8#, and 9# before treatment, the others were normal. Before treatment, slight rises of fibrinogen and D\u2010dimer (D\u2010D) in some patients. It was observed that the feces occult blood test was weakly positive only in case 1# with bad diarrhea before treatment. In addition, the results of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 were positive before treatment and gradually turned negative during and after treatment, while nine kinds of common respiratory pathogens were all negative in patients.\nTable 1.

AT, after treatment (the day on which the patient was discharged); BT, before treatment; DT, during treatment (the day on which the virus test turned out to be negative for the first time)\nCombination therapy was performed in all cases. There were four cases (1#, 3#, 8#, and 9#) with severe infection, who were treated with interferon alfa\u20102b (10 million international unit (IU) daily), lopinavir and ritonavir tablets (800/200\u2009mg daily), methylprednisolone (40\u2009mg daily), moxifloxacin hydrochloride (0.4\u2009g daily), and high\u2010flow nasal oxygen therapy. Among these, additional intravenous immunoglobulin (200\u2009mg/kg daily) and thymalfasin (1.6\u2009mg twice a week) were employed to enhance immune of cases 1# and 8#, respectively. In addition, the traditional Chinese medicine (Qingfei Paidu Decoction) were used for preventing and treating pulmonary fibrosis in casess 1#, 8#, and 9#. The other cases (2#, 4#, 5#, 6#, and 7#) with moderate infection received interferon alfa\u20102b (10 million IU daily), lopinavir and ritonavir tablets (800/200\u2009mg daily), and moxifloxacin hydrochloride (0.4\u2009g daily). Moreover, low\u2010flow nasal oxygen therapy was used to relieve dyspnea in case 6#. The average period of treatment of nine patients who tested negative for SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 for the first time was 6 days (range from 4 to 11). Based on the persistent negative results of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102, the lung lesions partially or completely resolved, as well as the gradually improved clinical symptoms, nine patients were discharged. The average days of hospital stay were 14.2 (range from 9 to 20).4 DISCUSSION\nCurrently, a sharp increase in confirmed cases infected with SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 have been reported in many countries around the world. Patients of COVID\u201019 with respiratory symptoms including fever, cough, chest tightness, and shortness of breath are viewed as the primary presenting manifestation. A small number of patients have digestive symptoms such as diarrhea and vomiting. In our nine patients, only two cases (1# with weak positive fecal occult blood and 2#) with diarrhea were treated with montmorillonite powder (3\u2009g, three times a day) or trigeminy viable organism powder (1\u2009g, three times a day) to arrest diarrhea or regulate intestinal flora. According to the Guideline for Diagnosis and Treatment of Novel Coronavirus\u2010infected Pneumonia (Trial version 6), patients were clinically classified into four categories including slight, moderate, severe, and imminent types.7 In our study, there were four severely ill patients and five moderate patients. Notably, the average age of the former (52 years old, range from 47 to 56 years old) was much higher compared with that of the latter (34.2 years old, range from 14 to 53 years old). During and after treatment, although partial clinical data are not available, the improved lung lesions have a good consistency with the recovery of the laboratory characteristics including CRP, pCO2, and pO2. However, PCT as an indicator of severe bacterial, fungal, and parasitic infections did not change significantly.11 In some cases, the decreased ALC and the percentage of CD3+, CD3+CD4+, and CD3+CD8+ cells have been detected before treatment. However, these cells gradually returned to normal levels after viral clearance. Chest CT examination and the detection of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 RNA also play a vital role.10, 12, 13 The former is helpful for rapid clinical assessment and taking effective segregating actions, while the latter has contributed to clinical diagnosis and specific drug therapy. Two male patients (cases 1# and 2#) have been observed with severe symptoms having had a history of smoking for more than 20 years.14 In addition, there were no deaths in nine patients during treatment, which was associated with the effective combination therapy of traditional Chinese and western medicine. After discharge, the patient should remain in contact isolation, and pay attention to rest more, nutrition, body temperature and the prevention of infection. The regular follow\u2010up of blood routine examination, chest CT examination and the detection of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 is necessary.15ACKNOWLEDGMENT\nThis study was supported by the Natural Science Foundation of Anhui Province (Grant No. 1908085QH325).

Pregnant women were also reported being infected with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID\u201019), which possesses similarity with the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). As reported by the previous SARS\u2010related studies, pregnant women were more susceptible to coronavirus infection and at a high risk of poor perinatal outcomes.3, 4 Nevertheless, studies on COVID\u201019 are still quite limited, leading to a great challenge for pregnant women care. Our study aimed to describe the clinical characteristics of pregnant women infected with COVID\u201019, and we hope this study could provide a guidance for clinical prevention and treatment of COVID\u201019 in pregnant women.2 MATERIALS AND METHODS\n2.1 Data sources\nOur study collected a total of five pregnant women with COVID\u201019, who were hospitalized for regular delivery in Maternal and Child Hospital of Hubei Province between January 20 and February 10, 2020 (Table 1). All patients were regularly given a prenatal routine examination that started from the first trimester. Ultrasound examination and fetal heart monitoring were offered regularly before delivery, no symptoms of viral pneumonia were observed. On latest admission, all patients received routine fetal heart monitoring and laboratory examinations including complete blood count, blood chemistry, coagulation test, liver and renal function, electrolytes, C\u2010reactive protein, procalcitonin, lactate dehydrogenase, and creatine kinase. The delivery strategy is determined according to the pregnant women's general situation. Apgar scoring and nursing was routinely given for the newborn after delivery. Once the patient had suspected symptoms, chest computed tomography (CT) scan and other blood analysis were instantly performed, antibiotics were empirically given in time to prevent bacterium\u2010related infection, patients were quarantined for an intensive treatment, and newborns were closely monitored with breastfeeding restriction. This study was approved by the ethical committee of Maternal and Child Hospital of Hubei Province, the work undertaken in this study conforms to the provisions of the Declaration of Helsinki (as revised in Tokyo 2004). Informed consent was obtained from all pregnant women.\nTable 1.

Abnormal results included the aforementioned imaging characteristics of pneumonia, decreased white blood cell (WBC) or lymphocyte counts in the early stage of the disease.\nThe diagnostic criteria for COVID\u201019 are based on the criteria for the suspected cases. Positive results from real\u2010time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT\u2010PCR) assay with samples like sputum, throat swabs, lower respiratory tract secretions or other specimens, or sequencing\u2010confirmed SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection. All patients in this study were reported positive for SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection through quantitative real\u2010time RT\u2010PCR tests.3 RESULTS\n3.1 Demographic characteristics\nAccording to the demographic data of five patients (Table 1), they were between the ages of 25 and 31 years old. None was a healthcare worker. All of them were physically fit and conceived naturally. The gestational weeks on admission were the third trimester (38th\u201041st weeks). Patients 1 and 5 had gestational diabetes and patient 2 had pre\u2010eclampsia before delivery. All patients lived in Wuhan, Hubei province.\nOn admission, all patients had no fever or cough before delivery. However, all patients\u2019 low\u2010grade fever (37.5\u2103\u201038.5\u2103), the most common onset symptom of COVID\u201019, occurred after delivery within 24\u2009hours, and the highest body temperature of patient 1 was 38.5\u00b0C. Patient 3 had a cough 1 day before giving birth, and patient 5 had the symptoms of coughing and nasal runny 10 days before delivery. All patients had no symptoms such as hemoptysis, dyspnea, shortness of breath, nausea, and vomiting. All oxygen saturation tests were normal.\n3.2 Laboratory findings\nLaboratory findings showed (Table 2) that in the early stage of the disease, the count of WBCs in all patients was normal, and two patients developed an increased WBC count 24\u2009hours after the symptom onset. The WBC counts of patient 5 were always abnormally high during hospital admission. C\u2010reactive protein levels increased in all patients but except patient 4, particularly in patient 5 who had a substantial increase (40.98\u2010125.90\u2009mg/L). There was no obvious abnormality of the procalcitonin levels observed in all patients. The levels of albumin were decreased in all patients, whereas the levels of alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, and total bilirubin were normal. All patients except patient 1 presented with the elevated levels of alkaline phosphatase. CK was reduced in patient 1 (21\u2009U/L) while increased in patient 3 (227\u2009U/L), respectively.\nTable 2.

Unusual chest imaging manifestations, featured with ground\u2010grass opacity, were frequently observed in bilateral (three cases) or unilateral lobe (two cases) by CT scan (Figure 1). All COVID\u201019 were laboratory\u2010confirmed by the RT\u2010PCR method.\nFigure 1\nOpen in figure viewerPowerPoint\nChest computed tomography (CT) image of the pregnant women with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID\u201019).

Patient 2 underwent an emergent cesarean section due to the fetal tachycardia during pregnancy, patient 5 underwent elective cesarean section due to gestational diabetes. Patients 1, 3, and 4 had a natural delivery. All patients had a smooth labor process, and no partial complications occurred. The weights of newborns ranged from 3235 and 4050\u2009g. Apgar scores were 10 points 1 and 5 minutes after delivery. No newborns showed the signs of perinatal COVID\u201019 infection, umbilical cord blood and amniotic fluid were not applied for virus detection due to the lack of reagent. No complications of placenta infarction and chorionic amniotic inflammation were reported. All patients were advised to stop breastfeeding and empirically given oseltamivir and azithromycin for treatment.\nTable 3.

Pregnant women infected with influenza showed a higher risk of hospitalizing than healthy pregnant women.8 Therefore, during the outbreak of COVID\u201019, a disease that still lacks a specific and effective treatment, the prevention and management of pregnant women and newborns should be emphasized during the peripartal period.\nThe data in our study showed that all pregnant women had no fever before delivery, but after delivery two patients developed coughing and low\u2010grade fever. Their CT scan results demonstrated the typical images of viral pneumonia. All five patients were confirmed with COVID\u201019 by the test of nucleic acid examination. The fetal tachycardia was observed in one pregnant woman who subsequently received an emergent cesarean section. Chen et al9 reported that pregnancy with pneumonia would have a higher risk of cesarean section, premature delivery, decreased Apgar score of the newborn, and low birth weight of the newborn, etc. Even patients with COVID\u201019 may only have the mild respiratory symptoms during pregnancy, they are still at a high risk of severe pneumonia and adverse pregnancy outcomes, especially for patients who have pre\u2010eclampsia or other complications, as pneumonia may aggravate pulmonary edema and oxygen saturation reduction.\nOur study showed that the strategy of delivery was not affected by the coexistence of COVID\u201019, the choice of cesarean section was mainly determined by obstetric factors. According to the previous research on SARS, the peritoneal fluid10 and faeces11 could be positive for virus detection, and the virus might be transmitted during vaginal and cesarean delivery. As reported by a recent newspaper, a newborn was diagnosed as COVID\u201019 30\u2009hours after delivery, which suggested that there may be a risk of virus intrauterine vertical transmission or infection through contact with the maternal secretion. However, another research including nine pregnant women showed no direct evidence of intrauterine infection,12 which was consistent with the research on pregnant women with SARS,13 therefore, we need to be alert to take preventive and treatment measures for newborns in such period. According to China experts\u2019 consensus, it is recommended to quarantine the infants whose mother is suspected or diagnosed with COVID\u201019 for 14 days. Currently, there is not enough evidence supporting the presence of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 in breast milk, however, breastfeeding is not recommended according to the experience from SARS.4\nOwing to the absence of symptoms before delivery, all patients neglected CT scan and nucleic acid screening on admission, like most Chinese pregnant women usually do. It is probable to miss the diagnosis of COVID\u201019, which could delay the diagnosis and treatment of patients, and increase the risk of transmission for surrounding people, containing healthcare workers. The pregnant women's exposure to CT radiation barely reaches the dose that causes harm to the fetus,14 so it is plausible to perform a COVID\u201019 screening during early pregnancy. In terms of treatment, pregnant women with MERS were not recommended to use ribavirin because of its risk to lead to fetal deformities.15 New drugs for the treatment of COVID\u201019 are still being tested in clinical trials,16 and the effects for pregnant women are still not definitive and require further study.125 CONCLUSION\nPregnant women infected with COVID\u201019 need to receive more intensive attention. COVID\u201019 could asymptotically occur during gestation but get diagnosed after delivery. The manifestations include postpartum fever, mild respiratory symptoms, and typical CT images. Therefore, the protective measures for COVID\u201019 are necessary on admission; The CT scan and real\u2010time RT\u2010PCR assay could be helpful for the prevention of cross\u2010transmission and early treatment of pregnant women with COVID\u201019.ACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThis study is funded by the National Natural Sciences Foundation of China (No. 81471473) and Chongqing Municipal Public Health Bureau, Chongqing People's Municipal Government (Nos. 2015XMSB0001298 and 2019ZDXM055).CONFLICT OF INTERESTS\nThe authors declare that there are no conflict of interests.AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS\nThe corresponding author GS and YS developed the study concept and design, critically reviewed the data and decided the content of the manuscript.

These diseases have posed serious threats to human health and socioeconomic development. On 8 December 2019, the Wuhan Municipal Health and Health Committee reported a cluster of unexplained pneumonia (later officially named as 2019 novel coronavirus disease, COVID\u201019, by the World Health Organization1). COVID\u201019 spread rapidly from Wuhan to other cities in China. As of 24 February 2020, a total of 77\u2009658 confirmed cases and 2663 deaths have been reported in 34 provinces and municipalities. The number continues to increase, and the peak has yet to be reached. Most cases originated from Hubei province. More than 2000 confirmed cases have been reported in more than 20 countries, such as South Korea, Italy, and Japan. The number of infected people is 17 times that of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS\u2010Cov) outbreak in Guangdong, China2 in 2003 and 50 times that of the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS\u2010Cov) outbreak in the Middle East3 in 2018, which also became global public health events.4\nStudies found that COVID\u201019 is caused by the novel coronavirus, SARS\u2010CoV\u20102. It is a novel betacoronavirus belonging to the lineage B (subgenus: sarbecovirus), which also contains SARS\u2010Cov.5 Genetic analysis indicated that SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 is genetically very similar to SARS\u2010Cov and the coronaviruses isolated from the bats, but the symptoms are significantly distinct.6 SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 spread mainly through respiratory droplets and contact transmission which is similar to the common flu, but potential feces\u2010oral transmission is possible according to some studies. Hence, it is important to maintain vigilance athough this hypothesis is still controversial.5 Despite efforts in clinical research and epidemiological investigation, we still have no answers to the following questions: (1) What is the range of the full spectrum of disease severity? (2) Who are infectious? Can we identify them? (3) How does the vital interest role of asymptomatic infected individuals play in the transmission? (4) How can we identify potential high\u2010risk groups or areas for prevention and control so that we can focus on optimization resources?7 Previous experience with SARS, MERS, and other outbreaks has indicated that focusing only on treating the sick is insufficient. We face an urgent need to expand public health activities to elucidate the epidemiology of the novel virus and characterize its potential impact as the epidemic evolves. A previous study8, 9 analyzed the epic characteristics of population distribution and transmission dynamics of COVID\u201019. Another study performed geo\u2010temporal analysis of viral spread at several periods, while discussed comprehensively the case characteristics, mortality, population distribution, and spatiotemporal characteristics based on a large sample of more than 40\u2009000 cases.10\nA large number of epidemiological studies have been launched, but most of them focus on disease characteristics, population distribution, and indicators. Several studies involving spatial and temporal distribution analysis only discussed the temporal and spatial information of cases separately. Those studies destroyed the continuity and ignored the possible interaction of spatiotemporal data and thus cannot reflect the temporal and spatial evolution of the epidemic accurately. Therefore, using the spatiotemporal information of the cases comprehensively is imperative to further exploring the potential spatiotemporal distribution characteristics and variation rules.\nThe space\u2010time cube (STC) model proposed by Hagerstrand11 has been used extensively in traffic safety, public health, and other areas.12, 13 It can be aggregated while preserving the continuity of spatiotemporal data14 and thus, the model can be useful in conducting a spatiotemporal analysis of the disease.15 The present study will identify the space\u2010time clustering pattern, determine the cold and hot spot trends, and show the results of the visual output for COVID\u201019 outbreak through the spatiotemporal analysis technique based on STC to enable observation of the identification of high\u2010 and low\u2010risk areas intuitively and provide information that can be used as basis for the next step in prevention and control strategy formulation.2 MATERIALS AND METHODS\n2.1 Data sources\nAll data in the present study were gathered from the Internet. The COVID\u201019 data, including confirmed cases, suspected cases, and deaths from 23 January 2020 to 24 February 2020 were obtained from the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention website.16 Permanent resident population data of cities were collected from the China Statistical Yearbook for Cities.17 Geographic coordinates and vector maps for each city were collected from Google Maps and National Administration of Surveying, Mapping, and Geoinformation website, respectively.18 We collected the above data on the following cities and municipalities (eg, Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, and Chongqi) in China, except for Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan because of the inadequate data from those districts. This study has been endorsed by the ethics committee of Guilin Medical University.\n2.2 Analysis methods\nIn the analysis process, MS Excel 2019 (Microsoft) was used to collate the original data and calculate the daily incidence (per 100\u2009000) of each city. The collated data were then converted into geographic information system (GIS) data. ArcGIS Desktop software (version 10.7; Environmental Systems Research Institute, Inc) provided analysis tools for kernel density analysis, STC construction, local outlier analysis, and emerging spatial and temporal hot spot analysis, and provided the visualization of the results.\n2.2.1 Construction of STC\nThe spatiotemporal information on epidemiological data is aggregated into spatiotemporal bin and generate a special data structure named NetCDF in STC, where x and y dimensions represent space and t dimension represents time. Each bin has a fixed location in space (x, y) and time (t). Columns covering the same (x, y) region share the same location ID, and these columns can be combined to represent a bin time series. The count value of each bin reflects the number of events or records that occur at a relevant location during the relevant time step interval. In this way, at any given moment, the corresponding section can be achieved in the three\u2010dimensional STC, that is, the plane geometry state of the real world (Figure 1).\nFigure 1\nOpen in figure viewerPowerPoint\nStructure of space\u2010time cube (http://pro.arcgis.com)\n2.2.2 Analysis of local outliers\nLocal outlier analysis can be used to analyze data clustering and outlier, which refers to the implementation of local Anselin Locan Moran's I statistics in space and time dimensions. It can recognize spatiotemporal statistically significant locations between research areas and its neighborhood by using neighborhood distance and time step neighborhood parameter to estimate Anselin Locan Moran's I statistics for each bin and output the six kinds of patterns as follows: only high\u2010high cluster, only high\u2010low outlier, only low\u2010high outlier, only low\u2010low cluster, multiple types, and never significant.19\n2.2.3 Analysis of emerging spatial and temporal hot spots\nEmerging spatiotemporal hot spot analysis can identify trends of epidemiologic data based on STC. Getis\u2010Ord Gi* statistics,20 including Z\u2010score, P value, and classification of each bin are calculated on the premise of setting neighborhood distance and time step parameter values and inputted into the STC. Then, the Mann\u2010Kendall trend test is used to assess the tendency of the hot and cold spots.21 Finally, according to the Z score and P values of those location with data and of each bin, research areas will be classified into the spatiotemporal pattern as follows: new, consecutive, intensifying, persistent, diminishing, sporadic, oscillating, historical hot/cold spot, and no pattern detected.3 RESULTS AND ANALYSIS\n3.1 Prevalence of COVID\u201019\nWe used line graph and thematic disease maps to analyze primarily the trend and distribution of COVID\u201019 and show the overall situation of the outbreak. Figure 2A shows the changes of the national epidemic from 20 January 2020 to 24 February 2020. The overall trend of confirmed cases and deaths rose rapidly and then slowed down. On 12 February 2020 the cumulative number of confirmed cases increased suddenly to 59\u2009804, with 15\u2009151 new cases on this day. The increase was attributed to the update of diagnostic criteria for COVID\u201019. Since 13 February 2020 the growth of the cumulative number of confirmed cases slowed down gradually, but the cumulative number of deaths has been increasing at a relatively steady rate. The bar chart shows the change in newly confirmed cases that indicate mainly a trend of increase and then decrease, which peaked on 12 February 2020 then declined rapidly and remained at a low level.\nFigure 2\nOpen in figure viewerPowerPoint\nThe trend of 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID\u201019). A, China; B, Hubei province and Wuhan city\nWe analyzed the change in the epidemic situation in Hubei province during the same period. As the hardest hit area of the epidemic, Hubei province has the highest proportion of all kinds of cases in China. As of 24 February 2020, Hubei had 64\u2009786 confirmed cases and 2563 deaths, accounting for 83.4% and 96.2% of the total number of cases in China, respectively. Wuhan, which is the capital city of Hubei province, has reported a total of 47\u2009071 confirmed cases and 203 deaths, accounting for 72.7% and 79.7% of the total cases in Hubei province, respectively. Figure 2B shows that the variation trend of the number of confirmed cases in Hubei and Wuhan is the same as that in the whole country. Similarly, the number of deaths in Hubei and Wuhan has been rising steadily, with most deaths having occurred in Wuhan.\nWe drew thematic maps (Figure 3) of the nation and Hubei province on 23 January, 11 February, and 24 February, and introduced the distribution of confirmed cases based on the data of the accumulated confirmed cases. On 23 January, all provinces reported confirmed cases except Tibet, Gansu, and Xinjiang, and those cases were distributed mainly in Hubei, Guangdong, Hunan, Chongqing, Zhejiang, and Beijing (Figure 3A). Over time, the outbreak spread rapidly, and the situation in Hubei and its surrounding provinces became worse, with Hubei being the worst (Figure 3B,C). On 23 January, eight cities in Hubei, including Wuhan, Xiaogan, Huanggang, and Xiantao reported confirmed cases only (Figure 3D), but an increasing number of cities in Hubei had also reported confirmed cases and the situation was becoming increasingly worse (Figure 3E,F) as time went on.\nFigure 3\nOpen in figure viewerPowerPoint\n2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID\u201019) case distribution in China and Hubei province.

D\u2010F, Hubei province case distribution on 23 January, 11 February, and 24 February, respectively\nWe explored the central tendency of the disease preliminarily by using kernel density analysis. Figure 4 shows the results of cumulative confirmed cases of COVID\u201019 during the three periods. On January 24 (Figure 4A), the shadow was distributed mainly in the south and northern region of China, whereas no shadow was observed in the northwest and Qinghai\u2010Tibet region temporarily. Hubei had the highest density shadow, followed by Zhejiang, Beijing, and Guangdong. On February 11 (Figure 4B), the area of shadow expanded and the high\u2010density shadow concentrated mainly in Hubei and its surrounding provinces. Meanwhile, the high\u2010density shadows were scattered in other places. On February 24 (Figure 4C), the case concentration trend became more obvious. The density shadow was concentrated mainly in Hubei, and the emission density shadow had disappeared.\nFigure 4\nOpen in figure viewerPowerPoint\nConcentrated regions of 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID\u201019) cases using kernel density analysis.

D, Geographical boundaries\n3.2 STC of COVID\u201019\nA total of 868 spatial locations comprising 135\u2009km\u2009\u00d7\u2009135\u2009km square were generated in the SCT of COVID\u201019, and the time step interval of the model was 1 day. Thus, a total of 28,644 time\u2010space bins were generated and the values in each bin recorded the corresponding morbidity. After the model was established, the nonparametric Mann\u2010Kendall statistical method was used to analyze and evaluate the overall trend of morbidity. The output results were Z\u2009=\u2009\u2212\u20091.9678 and P\u2009=\u2009.0491 (<.05), which was statistically significant. This result indicated a downward trend in the overall incidence rate of COVID\u201019. The incidence rate of COVID\u201019 in 3D STC was divided by the method of natural breakpoint: 0\u20100.239, 0.240\u20100.943, 0.944\u20102.375, 2.376\u20105.100, 5.101\u201010.515, and 10.516\u201041.836 (per 100\u2009000; Figure 5).\nFigure 5\nOpen in figure viewerPowerPoint\nGenerated space\u2010time cube of COVID\u201019\n3.3 Result of local outlier analysis\nWe conducted local outlier analysis of 218 locations based on the STC of COVID\u201019 and the analysis results are presented in Table 1. The spatiotemporal clustering pattern of COVID\u201019 was dominated mainly by a single clustering pattern, with 2 only high\u2010high (0.92%) and 167 only low\u2010low clustering locations (76.61%). The locations of the two clustering patterns were 169 in total, accounting for 77.53% of the absolute locations. A total of 29 (13.3%) multiple types and six locations containing only high\u2010low and only low\u2010high outliers were present, accounting for 2.75% of the total locations. The above analysis results suggested that the outbreak presented a strong clustering pattern during the period of study, and the only low\u2010low clustering was the main spatial and temporal clustering pattern.\nTable 1.

Most single clustering patterns and multiple types are distributed in the southern and northern regions of China, but the distribution is uneven. The only high\u2010high clustering pattern distributes in Wuhan and Shiyan, Hubei province. Multiple type patterns are present in the surrounding provinces, including Henan, Anhui, Jiangxi, Hunan, and Chongqing, indicating that at least one spatial clustering pattern is present previously in these areas and still contain the possibility of developing into single clustering patterns. Wuhan is still the center of the epidemic and affects the situation of those surrounding areas. All other regions except the abovementioned areas are dominated by a significant only low\u2010low clustering pattern, indicating that the epidemic situation remains at a relatively low level in general.\nFigure 6\nOpen in figure viewerPowerPoint\nVisual results of local outlier analysis for COVID\u201019\n3.4 Result of emerging spatiotemporal hot spots\nThe analysis results are shown in Table 2. In the 218 locations, 47 locations show spatiotemporal trend of cold/hot spots, including 38 consecutive hot and 19 cold spots (ie, 5 new and 14 consecutive cold spots). Most areas do not show significant spatial and temporal trends as shown in Figure 7, and most of the cold and hot spots are concentrated in the south and north region of China. The consecutive hot spots are concentrated mainly in Hubei and its surrounding provinces, including Henan, Anhui, Jiangxi, and Hunan. This result indicates that the incidence rate in this area has been at a high level. The consecutive cold spots distributed in Shanxi, Hebei, Shandong, Guizhou, and Guangxi suggest that the incidence rate in these areas has been low. New cold spots have appeared in Ningxia, Shanxi, Hebei, and Shandong provinces, manifesting that the epidemic situation in these places has been controlled effectively and that the incidence rate has changed from high to low. No significant intensifying or new hot spots were found in this study, indicating that the epidemic situation in China is basically stable and developing in a better direction.\nTable 2.

The main findings are as follows. (1) The outbreak had spread rapidly throughout the country within a short time and the total incidence rate has decreased. (2) The spatiotemporal distribution of cases is uneven. On the spatiotemporal clustering pattern, Wuhan and Shiyan cities are at the center of the spatiotemporal clustering pattern, with high\u2010high clustering pattern surrounding unstable multiple\u2010type patten in partial areas of Henan, Anhui, Jiangxi, and Hunan provinces and Chongqing city. Those regions are in a consecutive hot spot on the spatiotemporal trend. (3) The spatiotemporal analysis technology based on the STC can analyze comprehensively the spatiotemporal pattern of the epidemiological data and produce a visual output of the consequences, which can reflect intuitively the distribution and trend of data in space\u2010time.\nThe outbreak is a serious public health emergency in the history of the People's Republic of China, resulting in human deaths and economic losses. COVID\u201019 is more infectious compared with SARS, with an average incubation period of 5 days (range of 0\u201024 days)22 and a basic reproduction index of 2\u20102.5.23 Droplet and contact transmission are the main transmission methods, but the live virus isolated from the feces of the sick indicates a potential \u201cfecal\u2010oral\u201d transmission method is possible.24 Convenience of spread of the virus contributes to the various transmission approaches. SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 asymptomatic cases, which were few in SARS, are common and can infect others. If they are unidentified, they will be at great risk of infecting others. As the capital of Hubei province, a large number of floating populations are attracted to Wuhan from other cities surrounding Hubei. After the outbreak, more than 5 million people emigrated from Wuhan before the city lockdown.25 Therefore, those asymptomatic or symptomatic cases bring potential risk of infection all over the country. Those cases, according to other reports from different cities, with exposure due to travel or coming into contact with the individuals who came from Wuhan or Hubei also confirmed this view. With the passage of time, asymptomatic or second\u2010generation cases began to be sick sequentially after the first or second incubation period. Most cases are concentrated in Wuhan because it is the place of origin. With efforts currently under way in China, the outbreak has been controlled effectively, and the number of cases is decreasing gradually in most areas besides Hubei. However, Hubei still faces multiple pressures including tension of medical and preventive personnel and material, enormous base number of cases (ie, confirmed and suspected), and high\u2010risk outbreak rebound. Therefore, the space\u2010time pattern in the region remains a hot spot trend. Previous experience has suggested that the closer an outbreak occurs, the greater is the risk of infection, which can explain in part the influence of Wuhan on its surrounding areas. Under the current situation of absence of effective drugs and vaccines against SARS\u2010CoV\u20102, nonpharmaceutical interventions remain central for prevention.26 The continued enhancement of the prevention and control efforts by the Chinese government in the abovementioned areas is significant to cope with the possible changes in the epidemic situation.\nIn the present study, the epidemic trend and distribution of the outbreak were analyzed briefly by using line graph and thematic maps, and the case density and clustering were verified simply by using kernel density analysis at different periods. The above methods were all based on time (one\u2010dimensional) or space (two\u2010dimensional) information. A simultaneous and comprehensive analysis of the time\u2010space information was difficult. The line graph can show directly the general trend of change, but reflecting the spatial information is difficult. The thematic maps and kernel density analysis can display distribution information, but certain deficiencies are present in dealing with the time dimension. STC can aggregate the spatial\u2010temporal information in the same data set, which provides a new method for the spatial\u2010temporal analysis of the epidemic, meets the requirements of preservation time and spatial continuity, and visualizes the analysis results.27 Therefore, we can observe the spatial\u2010temporal clustering pattern and change trend of the outbreak more intuitively. The WHO considers timely mathematical models to play an important role in epidemic assessment, making health decisions, and evaluating the intervention effect.23 Thus, the results of this study may provide basic information on epidemic space\u2010time for decision makers.\nFurther research is needed in the following aspects for this study as follows. First, does the reported case represent actual certainty? Therefore, the accuracy of spatiotemporal analysis results based on reported cases may be suspected. Second, the spatial information of the case is accurate only at the city level, which will be considered large in this study and may have caused many spatial information to be ignored, which affected the accuracy of spatial analysis. Third, other factors that may have affected the outbreak were not considered, such as movement of personnel, population density, and demographic characteristics of each region. Therefore, we will supplement and improve the relevant data to compensate for the above defects.ACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThis study was supported by Guangxi Science and Technology Development Project (No. AD17129003); Guangxi Graduate Education Innovation Project (No. YCSW2020230).CONFLICT OF INTERESTS\nThe authors declare that there are no conflict of interests.AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS\nConception and design: CM and CB.

SARS\u2010CoV and MERS\u2010CoV are considered highly pathogenic and are known to be transmitted from bats to humans via intermediate host palm civets4 and dromedary camels5. SARS\u2010CoV, which causes severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), infected 8422 humans and resulted in 916 deaths in 37 countries between 2002 and 2003.6, 7 MERS\u2010CoV was first identified in the Middle East in 2012. A report confirmed 1791 MERS\u2010CoV infection cases, including at least 640 deaths in 27 countries, as of July 2016.8 Because of the confirmed human\u2010to\u2010human transmission route, up to 18 February 2020, a total of 72\u2009533 patients of COVID\u201019, caused by SARS\u2010CoV\u20102, including 1872 deaths, were reported in China (http://2019ncov.chinacdc.cn/2019\u2010nCoV/index.html). In addition, 505 COVID\u201019 cases have now been transmitted across other 24 countries (http://2019ncov.chinacdc.cn/2019\u2010nCoV/global.html), a part of them because of contact or residence history with Wuhan.\nConfirmation of intermediate hosts is essential to prevent further spread of the epidemic. This study focuses on comparisons of the spike sequences between SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 with SARS\u2010CoV, bat SARS\u2010like CoV, and other coronaviruses, which are helpful for evolutionary analysis and finding the possible virus reservoirs. In addition, analysis of the ACE2 structures and binding motif alignment facilitates obtaining clues to differentiate the potential hosts.2 MATERIALS AND METHODS\n2.1 Sequences used in the study\nFull\u2010length protein sequences of spike glycoprotein and ACE2 were downloaded from the NCBI GenBank Database, including SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 spike proteins (accession number: QHU79173, QHR84449, QHQ71963, QHO62107, QHO60594, QHN73795, QHD43416, and BBW89517) SARS\u2010CoV spike proteins (accession number: ACU31051, ACU31032, NP_828851, ABF65836, AAR91586, and AAP37017), bat SARS\u2010like CoV (RaTG13, AVP788042, AVP78031, ATO98231, AGZ48828, AKZ19087, and AID16716). The bat SARS\u2010like CoV RaTG13 sequence was downloaded from the GISAID (http://www.GISAID.org). The pangolin metagenome was downloaded from the NCBI BioProject database (PRJNA5732983), and the coronavirus genomes sequences were analyzed by VirMAP.9\n2.2 Protein sequences alignment and phylogenetic analysis\nAlignment of spike protein sequences from different sources and residue comparison of ACE2 among different species were accomplished by MGEA\u2010X (version 10.0.5). The phylogenetic analysis was accomplished through multiple comparisons using the neighbor\u2010joining algorithm in the MGEA\u2010X (version 10.0.5). Multiple comparisons were done by ClustalW multiple sequence alignment, the neighbor\u2010joining phylogenies were estimated, and the number of bootstraps was 1000. The Poisson correction model and gamma\u2010distributed pattern were used.\n2.3 Structure and binding model of spike receptor\nThe full\u2010length structure of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 spike glycoprotein was simulated by the I\u2010TASSER server online tool.10 The spike\u2010ACE2 binding model was predicted using PRISM 2.0.11 The spike protein and ACE2 structure files were analyzed using PyMOL software (PyMOL v1.0).3 RESULTS\nSARS\u2010CoV\u20102 encodes at least 27 proteins, including 15 nonstructural proteins, 4 structural proteins, and 8 auxiliary proteins.12 Spike glycoprotein (S), a structural protein located on the outer envelope of the virion, binds to the host\u2010receptor angiotensin\u2010converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). The S glycoprotein of SARS\u2010CoV, MERS\u2010CoV, and SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 has 1104 to 1273 amino acids and contains an amino (N)\u2010terminal S1 subunit and a carboxyl (C)\u2010terminal S2 subunit13 (Figure 1). In the S1 subunit, the receptor\u2010binding domain (RBD), spanning about 200 residues, consists of two subdomains: the core and external subdomains.14, 15 The RBD core subdomain is responsible for the formation of S trimer particles.16 The external subdomain contains two exposed loops on the surface, which bind with ACE2.17 Investigating the evolutionary relationship of the RBD sequence in spike protein is helpful for understanding the virus origin trends.\nFigure 1\nOpen in figure viewerPowerPoint\nStructural diagrams of spike glycoproteins of SARS\u2010CoV, MERS\u2010CoV, and SARS\u2010CoV\u20102. All spike proteins of coronaviruses contain S1 subunit and S2 subunit, which were divided by the S cleavage sites. FP, fusion peptide; HR, heptad repeat 1 and heptad repeat 2; RBD, receptor\u2010binding domain, contains core binding motif in the external subdomain; SP, signal peptide\nPhylogenetic reconstruction determines the evolutionary relationship and host selection between spike glycoproteins in the human\u2010close beta coronaviruses. To better understand the host selection of beta coronaviruses, the relationship of spike glycoprotein between SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 and other closely related beta coronaviruses has been analyzed. The result showed that bat SARS\u2010like CoV RaTG13, with 96.2% overall genome sequence identity,18 is an inner joint neighbor of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 (Figure 2). In October 2019, it was reported that Sendai virus and coronavirus were the dominant viruses in the virome data of Malayan pangolins.19 It is noteworthy that SARS\u2010CoV was the most widely distributed coronavirus in the pangolin samples. We blasted the SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 reads and found that the spike protein sequence was present in pangolin SARS\u2010like CoV (numbered SRR10168377 here). The S protein in pangolin SARS\u2010like CoV SRR10168377 (marked as red star) possesses only 75% similarity with SARS\u2010CoV\u20102, partly because there were more than 220 residues in the S2 subunit that had not been read in the virome data. Removing the lost sequences, there was still 88% similarity with SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 (data not shown); the full\u2010length sequence of spike protein between pangolin SARS\u2010like CoV and SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 seems to be a little different. The temporal tree showed that the divergence time of spike sequence between bat SARS\u2010like RaTG13 and SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 is 0.18, while it is 1.50 in bat SARS\u2010like RaTG13 to SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 cluster (Figure S1).\nFigure 2\nOpen in figure viewerPowerPoint\nPhylogenetic analysis of sequences of coronavirus spike glycoproteins. The sequences of spike glycoproteins of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102, bat SARS\u2010like CoV, pangolin SARS\u2010like CoV, and SARS\u2010CoV were analyzed. The red stars indicate pangolin SARS\u2010like CoV and bat SARS\u2010like CoV. Host flags are marked after the clusters. SARS\u2010CoV\u20102, severe respiratory syndrome coronavirus\u20102\nGlobal expansion and deep sequencing work have led to an increased amount of the SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 genotype. Studying selective stress may be helpful for assessing the variability and potential for host changes of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102. Based on a report,20 the selective pressure analysis showed that genes (ORF10 and ORF7a) have a greater selective pressure, and Spike has an average pressure relative to the whole genome (Figure S2). The spike RBD\u2010receptor interaction is a key factor determining the host range of coronaviruses. The RBD sequences of spike protein from SARS\u2010CoV, bat, or pangolin SARS\u2010like CoV and SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 were aligned (Figure 3). There are some deletions from 473 to 490 residues in bat SARS\u2010like CoV, which are located in the external subdomain, and it seems that these viruses do not infect humans naturally, given that there is no direct evidence showing that bat SARS\u2010like CoV has ever infected humans. Interestingly, the SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 RBD sequence from 329 to 521 possesses 93% identity with pangolin SARS\u2010like CoV SRR10168377, which has higher than 89% similarity with bat SARS\u2010like CoV RaTG13 (Figure 3). Pangolin SARS\u2010like CoV SRR10168377 has only 85% similarity with bat SARS\u2010like CoV RaTG13, indicating that if focusing on only the spike RBD, pangolin SARS\u2010like CoV SRR10168377 has a higher probability to cross host barriers and infect humans.\nFigure 3\nOpen in figure viewerPowerPoint\nSequence alignments of the receptor\u2010binding domain (RBD) of coronavirus spike glycoproteins. The amino acid sequences of RBD of severe respiratory syndrome coronavirus\u20102 (SARS\u2010CoV\u20102), pangolin SARS\u2010like CoV, bat SARS\u2010like CoV, and SARS\u2010CoV were aligned. The sequence identities among SARS\u2010CoV\u20102, pangolin SARS\u2010like CoV SRR10168377, and bat SARS\u2010like CoV RaTG13 are marked. Arrows show the key residues in the interface binding to ACE2. Arrows indicate the critical binding residues for interaction between coronaviruses spike and receptor, triangle marks the ACE2\u2010contacting residues on spike RBD. *The unified amino acids in the same sites of all aligned sequences\nSARS\u2010CoV enters the respiratory tract by the receptor ACE2.14 It was reported that SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 uses the same cell entry receptor.18 To understand the possibility of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 RBD binding with ACE2, the structure of spike protein of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 was simulated (Figure 4A). The difference in the whole structure of spike protein between SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 (red) and SARS\u2010CoV (green) was alimented, the coverage of the threading alignment was 0.83 (the number of aligned residues divided by the full\u2010length protein), and the normalized Z score of the threading alignment was 6.27 (>1 means a good alignment). The external subdomain in RBD has also been identified. The interaction model of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 with human ACE2 was then calculated by the PRISM 2.0 database (Figure 4B), which was generally similar to the structure of SARS\u2010CoV S protein binding with human receptor ACE2 (Figure 4C). Based on our results and two recent reports,21, 22 we noticed that SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 numbering S protein may bind to ACE2 through Leu455, Phe486, Gln493, Asn501, and Tyr505, only quartier is same as SARS\u2010CoV. In the external subdomain of SARS\u2010CoV, residues L472, N479, and T487 (SARS\u2010CoV numbering) are the main interfacing positions; mutations of these sites support S adaptation for binding to the human ACE2 better than civet ACE2.23 At the residue position of 82 in the mouse receptor, asparagine of bat (Rhinolophus pearsonii) ACE2 may disrupt the interaction with Leu472 of SARS\u2010CoV RBD by steric interference hydrophobic contact, while Met82 in human receptor may interact with position 472 of RBD. Residues K479 and S487 in civet SARS\u2010CoV can effectively recognize civet ACE2, but bind with human ACE2 much less efficiently.23 The residue Thr487 in RBD binds to Tyr41 and Lys353 in human ACE2 by van der Waals contacts,25 and threonine at position 487 enhanced the affinity of most RBDs for civet and human ACE2.24 Residues in positions 479 and 487 in SARS\u2010CoV correspond to the sites 493 and 501 in SARS\u2010CoV\u20102, respectively. Residues Tyr493 and Asp501 in bat SARS\u2010like CoV RaTG13 were replaced with Gln493 and Asn501 in SARS\u2010CoV\u20102, respectively, same as pangolin SARS\u2010like CoV SRR10168377.\nFigure 4\nOpen in figure viewerPowerPoint\nThe binding of receptor\u2010binding domain (RBD) external subdomain of spike glycoprotein with receptor ACE2.

RBD contained external subdomain marked in the box. B, The binding model of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 spike (lower) with human receptor (upper). The possible residues in the interface of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 spike are shown as sticks. C, Human ACE2 critical for the binding with SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 spike RBD is shown. The key residues located in the interface of ACE2 possibly in combination with spike RBD are shown as a sphere and colored\nConsistent with SARS\u2010CoV binding to human ACE2, the residues 31, 41, 82, 353, 355, and 357 on the receptor locate in the interface when interacting with SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 spike protein (Figure 4B,C). More than five substitutions were observed in turtle (Chrysemys picta bellii, Chelonia mydas, and Pelodiscus sinensis), pangolin (Manis javanica), and bat (both Rhinolophus sinicus and R. pearsonii) receptors in contrast to the theoretical infection\u2010permissive species, such as human, gorilla, and macaca (Table 1). Mouse and dog also have multiple (\u22655) substitutions while cat and hamster only contain three mutations in the region. It was showed that Lys31, Tyr41, and Lys353 mutations substantially interfere with the S1\u2010Ig association.24 It is noteworthy that at position 41, all maintain tyrosine in all observed species, expect bats (both R. sinicus and R. pearsonii) substituted by histidine; at position 353, all contain lysine expect mouse, which contains His353. The turtle receptor at position 31 contains glutamine or glutamic acid and mouse receptor contains asparagine; other observed species all contain lysine, same as humans. Substitution of His353 with Lys353 in mouse ACE2 allows SARS\u2010CoV to infect murine cells,14 indicating the importance of residue Lys353 binding with receptor. In addition, considering the function of position 41 in the interaction with receptor, tyrosine may possess higher affinity with Asn501 of RBD than histidine. From this perspective of Asn501 in RBD domain with the sites 41 and 353 of ACE2 receptor, it seems that turtles and pangolins are closer to humans than bat, indicating that turtles and pangolins may be the potential expanded hosts of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102. The structural basis underlying this observed difference remains to be illustrated.\nTable 1. Residues comparison of ACE2 among different species interacting with SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 spike glycoprotein RBD\nNote: Mutated residues are highlighted as red at the corresponding positions based on human ACE2 numbering.\nAbbreviations: RBD, receptor\u2010binding domain; SARS\u2010CoV\u20102, severe respiratory syndrome coronavirus\u20102.4 DISCUSSION\nKnowing the structural binding mechanism will support finding the accurate virus reservoirs and facilitate prevention countermeasure development. The crystallization of spike protein of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 was urgently analyzed by cryoelectron microscopy;13 it helps to verify the interfacing sites in the interaction between SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 spike RBD and human ACE2 or other hosts' receptors. It has been reported that the binding capacity of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 S protein to ACE2 is much stronger than that of SARS\u2010CoV,13 which indicates that there are more intermediate hosts for SARS\u2010CoV\u20102.\nPangolin SARS\u2010like CoV SRR10168377 seems to point to the host range of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 expanded from pangolin. It is currently known that turtle also acts as a virus reservoir, carrying more than dozens of viruses, including ranavirus (RV), nidovirus (NV), papillomavirus (PV), soft\u2010shelled turtle iridovirus (STIV), soft\u2010shelled turtle systemic septicemia spherical virus (STSSSV), tortoise picornavirus (ToPV), and Trionyx sinensis hemorrhagic syndrome virus (TSHSV).26-30 It does not exclude that bat SARS\u2010like CoV RaTG13 or other SARS\u2010like CoV infect turtle and expand to humans after evolution.\nFrom SARS\u2010CoV and MERS\u2010CoV to SARS\u2010CoV\u20102, all point to bats as the natural host of coronaviruses, but the intermediate hosts are all different. Previous findings suggested that the snake is a probable wildlife animal reservoir for SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 based on its relative synonymous codon usage bias resembling snake compared with other animals.31 Civets and dromedary, as the intermediate hosts of zoonotic SARS\u2010CoV and MERS\u2010CoV, live in different time and space environments. They nevertheless transmitted the coronaviruses to humans, which makes it difficult to find the intermediate hosts of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 in the short term. Analysis of the viral receptor\u2010binding sequences and host receptors helps to quickly target the possible intermediate hosts of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102. Compared with the illegally traded pangolins, turtles in the markets are more common and popular. This study provides information and possibilities that like snakes and pangolins, turtles (C. picta bellii, C. mydas, and P. sinensis) may also act as the potential intermediate hosts transmitting SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 to human, although much more needs to be confirmed.ACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThis study was supported by research grants from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (81902066, 81730061, and 81471942), the Natural Science Foundation of Hubei Provincial Department of Education (Q20192104 and Q20192105), the Hubei Provincial Natural Science Foundation (2018CFB093 and 2018CFB185), Cultivating Project for Young Scholar at Hubei University of Medicine (2017QDJZR08 and 2016QDJZR03), and the Hubei Provincial Training Program of Innovation and Entrepreneurship for Undergraduates (S201910929032 and S201913249006).CONFLICT OF INTERESTS\nThe authors declare that there are no conflict of interests.AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS\nZL, JW, and LL contributed to data analysis, technical graphics, and writing the paper.

To the best of our knowledge, the earliest onset of symptom was reported in a patient who was later diagnosed with \u201cpneumonia of unknown etiology\u201d on 1 December 2019,1 and then in late December 2019, several local hospitals reported similar cases in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.2 On 6 January, an \u201cunknown pathogen\u201d was examined and identified as 2019 novel coronavirus (2019\u2010nCoV); it was later renamed as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS\u2010CoV\u20102) with regard to the features of the virus and the disease was termed 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID\u201019).3 In spite of the strong efforts taken to control the virus, 80\u2009955 cases were confirmed in China by 11 March.4 As the domestic epidemic situation finally calmed down, with only 31 new cases being reported nationwide in the past 24\u2009hours, more and more outbreaks are being reported abroad. By 11 March, a total of 37\u2009371 cases were reported outside China, affecting 113 countries/territories/areas.4 On 11 March, WHO characterized COVID\u201019 as a pandemic.5\nCoronaviruses are spherical, enveloped, single\u2010stranded RNA viruses. By the end of 2019, six coronavirus species were proven to cause diseases among humans. Among these six, HCoV\u2010229E, \u2010NL63, \u2010OC43, and \u2010HKU1 are the four prevalent types that cause common cold. Two strains, on the contrary, account for fatal illness: severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS\u2010CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS\u2010CoV).6, 7 COVID\u201019 shares very similar transmission routes and clinical manifestations with SARS and MERS; however, its infectivity is stronger than that of SARS and MERS.8 Some specialists also suggested that the severity of COVID\u201019 might be no weaker than SARS according to clinical observation. Pregnant women are more susceptible to the virus due to immune and anatomic alteration,9 although no data regarding the incidence and fatality due to COVID\u201019 are reported, the adverse pregnancy outcome of SARS and MERS should raise an alert.10, 11\nShenzhen is an immigrant city with a population of over 13 million in China.12 Around the Chinese New Year, a mass population flow that involved millions of migrant workers might be partially responsible for the virus outbreak. Until 11 March, 420 cases were confirmed, making Shenzhen the second infected city outside Hubei provenience. In addition, according to Shenzhen Municipal Health Commission, there were 187\u2009880 parturients in 2018.13 Thus, maternal health management during the COVID\u201019 outbreak became extremely important. In this article, we will demonstrate the management process of three pregnant women who presented fever after being admitted to gynecology or obstetrics department. Then, we further illustrate our maternal health care management strategies that were developed and modified by referring to the guidelines formulated by specialists from Wuhan and other cities in adjustment to local situations in Shenzhen and our hospital. Meanwhile, the literature review of Chinese and English publications referring to such topic is done to compare some of our managing strategies with those of other areas.2 CASE REPORT\n2.1 Case 1\nA 25\u2010year\u2010old female with a history of normal menstruation visited our hospital owing to lower abdominal pain at 47 days of amenorrhea. The patient appeared to be in a generally stable condition, so she was asked to finish an epidemiological evaluation including contact history, clinical signs, and body temperature (detailed criteria listed in the next section) before she was allowed into the out\u2010patient building. Then, based on her symptoms, she was referred to the department of gynecology. The patient complained pain in the lower abdominal area, and palpation indicated tenderness in bilateral adnexa areas, especially on the right side. Urine human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) was positive and ultrasound displayed a 22\u2009\u00d7\u200916\u2009mm mass on her right adnexa, and free liquid areas that measured 24\u2009mm and 13\u2009mm deep were also seen in the front and back sides of her uterus separately. Based on the clinical manifestations, she was suspected of ectopic pregnancy, which needed hospitalization. Before admission, blood routine, blood HCG, and viral nucleic acid test (nasopharyngeal swab, polymerase chain reaction [PCR]) were taken; chest computed tomography (CT) was also obtained after fully informing her about the risk of COVID\u201019, the possibility of infection with negative viral nucleic acid result,14 the possibility of intrauterine pregnancy, and the potential risk of low\u2010dose radiation exposure during pregnancy. Her blood routine test showed that hemoglobin was 124\u2009g/L, leukocyte count was 9.95\u2009\u00d7\u2009109, and lymphocyte count was 1.59\u2009\u00d7\u2009109, making her lymphocyte ratio 16%, which was below the normal range. Chest CT did not indicate any abnormality. Considering the potential risk of tubal rupture, she was admitted before other results came out but quarantined in a single\u2010bed ward.\nAfter admission, she developed a mild fever measuring 37.5\u00b0C, taken together that her lymphocyte ratio was below normal range, we were alarmed. In addition, she complained that her abdominal pain was intensified. Hence, we immediately informed all the staff in our department about the issue and the protection required when having contact with her. Then, we informed the patient's family about her current situation and gave them epidemiological evaluation and self\u2010quarantine advice. Meanwhile, we retested blood routine and consulted COVID\u201019 and respiratory specialists. Blood routine showed that her hemoglobin dropped from 124 to 113\u2009g/L, but her leukocyte and lymphocyte were the same as before, and her blood HCG was 9416.7\u2009mIU/mL. Although her viral nucleic acid test result was not out yet, we decided to perform surgery considering her condition. Both COVID\u201019 and respiratory specialists re\u2010evaluated her contact history, clinical manifestations, test results, and CT images and concluded that the evidence did not support SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection. After informing the operating room about the patient's COVID\u201019\u2010related evaluation, her operation was arranged. During the surgery, medical protective respirator, goggles, disposable waterproof surgical gown were required for all staffs. After surgery, although her temperature dropped to 37\u00b0C, the patient was quarantined in her single\u2010bed ward again, and her body temperature was monitored on an hourly basis until the viral nucleic acid result come out negative. The next morning, we retested blood routine, her leukocyte count dropped to 5.9\u2009\u00d7\u2009109/L, and her lymphocyte ratio raised to 22%, and it appeared that her fever was more likely induced by her ectopic pregnancy.\n2.2 Case 2\nA 28\u2010year\u2010old female, gravida 3 para 0, was admitted to the obstetrics department for planned induced labor due to gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) at 40\u2009+\u20096 gestational week. During the pregnancy, no complication was detected other than GDM, and her blood glucose was well controlled. Before admission, she denied going to Hubei provenience or having direct contact with any confirmed COVID\u201019 patient or people from Hubei provenience. She also denied having COVID\u201019\u2010related symptoms such as fever, coughing, fatigue, sneezing, sore throat, or diarrhea recently. After admission, in a routine temperature check (three times a day), her body temperature was found to be 37.4\u00b0C, which was above the normal range (below 37.3\u00b0C). After further digging the contact history, she found that a week ago one diagnosed patient was reported visiting the apartment complex she lived in, but no one in that apartment complex was infected by that time.\nAlthough she did not meet the criteria (listed in the next section) to be qualified as a suspected patient, she had two risk factors, which are potential exposure to a diagnosed patient and fever. For prudential reasons, we quarantined her in a single\u2010bed ward, took blood routine and viral nucleic acid test, and started monitoring her body temperature on an hourly basis within the first 3 hours and then once every 4 hours. In the following 2 hours, her body temperature remained above 37.3\u00b0C, so after fully informing her about relative risks, she agreed for CT scans and the images showed a 3\u2009\u00d7\u20092\u2009mm mass in the upper left lung lobe. We immediately consulted COVID\u201019 specialist and doctor from respiratory department. After a careful study of the images, both doctors suggested that the mass did not have a typical COVID\u201019 pneumonia appearance, which was later confirmed by the negative viral nucleic acid test result. The patient's body temperature dropped back to normal without any medical intervention the next afternoon, though we kept watch on her body temperature, the alarm was off and we performed induced labor, a healthy newborn was delivered the next evening.\n2.3 Case 3\nA 27\u2010year\u2010old female, gravida 1 para 0, had a regular 30\u2010day menstrual cycle before her last menstrual period on 15 December 2019. At 5 weeks of amenorrhea, she visited a hospital in Zhanjiang City, Guangdong Province, intrauterine pregnancy with fetal heartbeat was discovered using ultrasound at the time. At 11 weeks and 4 days of gestation, the patient suffered spotting, ultrasound examination at a hospital in Guangzhou showed intrauterine pregnancy without fetal heartbeat, and then, at 12\u2009+\u20095 gestational week, she came to our hospital. At first triage, she was classified as low\u2010risk patient according to epidemiological evaluation, but as we were investigating her medical history, we learned that she had traveled to two different cities, she took a train on the last trip, and she also took subway twice in the past week. As her only discomfort was mild vaginal bleeding, we prescribed CT scans and viral nucleic acid tests before other checkups. In the afternoon, both reports were found to be normal. Hence, after further serum and ultrasound check, we admitted her to the in\u2010patient gynecology department.\nAfter a regular misoprostol treatment, the patient started having a mild fever (body temperature at 37.5\u00b0C). She also complained uterine contraction, but her abdomen was soft, with no tenderness and rebound tenderness being spotted during palpation. Though her fever was more likely induced by other causes such as adverse reaction of misoprostol or even infection, precautions were still taken. The patient was quarantined in a single\u2010bed ward, and her body temperature was monitored once per hour. Then, we further looked into her travel history. Now that all train, plane or ship tickets are registered with identification number in China, once someone is diagnosed, the passengers on the same transport will be informed, hence people can also check whether they shared public transportation with a COVID\u201019 diagnosed patient. In addition, every public transportation has its own QR code in Shenzhen, passengers are advised to scan them to form an e\u2010trace for themselves. After thorough investigation of her travel history, she didn't find any reported diagnosed COVID\u201019 case that shared transportation with her. We also took blood routine, C\u2010reactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin (PCT), and viral nucleic acid test. The results showed that leukocyte count, lymphocyte count, CRP, and PCT were all within the normal range. Then, we invited COVID\u201019 and respiratory specialists. According to both doctors, there was no sign of infection on the report of chest CT which she took 2 days ago, and taken together that she did not have any respiratory symptoms, a second CT scan was not needed. Two hours later, her body temperature dropped back to 36.8\u00b0C, viral nucleic acid later also reported negative. Before viral nucleic acid result came back, second\u2010level protection was requested for all the staff who needed physical contact with her.3 MATERNAL MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES\n3.1 Maternal health care advises during the outbreak\nTo avoid further spread of the epidemic, people are advised to stay at home, which brings up a dilemma for many pregnant women about whether to go the hospital. First and foremost, intrauterine pregnancy confirmation and antenatal care are essential. Statistics show that more than 2% pregnancy is ectopic,15 and birth defects or genetic disorders occurs in approximately 3% to 5% pregnancies.16 Congenital malformations caused by genetic or chromosomal defects not only threaten lives of the patients but also exert pain on their families.17 Proper maternal health care not only significantly reduces the occurrence and mortality of pregnancy complications18 but also prevents congenital malformations.19 Meanwhile, the risk of exposure can be reduced by self\u2010protection, patient triage according to risk level, and early quarantine of suspected and diagnosed patients. Therefore, canceling hospital visits may reduce the probability of viral infection; the aftereffect could leave bigger impact.\nDuring COVID\u201019 outbreak, the following checkups are recommended. In the first trimester, ultrasonographic examination to confirm intrauterine pregnancy after 6 weeks of amenorrhea is advised by us. In Wuhan, similar recommendations are offered by Wuhan Municipal Heath Commission, however, patients are advised to consult and make appointment online prior to hospital visits. It is also recommended to first consult online when suffering discomfort such as lower abdominal pain or vaginal bleeding. A list of non\u2010antiepidemic hospitals is publicized so that pregnant women can choose safer access to regular antenatal care. In addition, various platforms were set to offer medical consultation, for pregnant women without complications and relative risk factors, some surveillance may be done at home with the guide from medical professionals.20 Ultrasonographic examination of the nuchal translucency along with serum tests including markers for chromosomal disorders, carrier screening, and TORCH screen is advised to be done in one visit between 11 and 13 weeks 6 days\u2019 gestation. For the second trimester, serum triple screen and second\u2010trimester transabdominal ultrasonography are recommended to be done in one visit between 20 and 20\u2009+\u20096 gestational weeks. Oral glucose tolerance testing should be done between 24 and 28 weeks but can be replaced by low sugar diet and self\u2010blood glucose monitor if a patient is undergoing home quarantine. During the third trimester, two visits between 30 and 32 weeks and 36 and 37 weeks for ultrasonographic examination and Group B streptococci test are recommended. These are in agreement with the recommendations given by specialists from Sichuan and Liaoning provenience.21, 22 In Wuhan, two visits between 29 and 32 weeks and 37 and 41 weeks are also recommended. For twins, ultrasonographic examination can also be prolonged from once every 2 weeks to once every 4 weeks.20 Fetal heart rate monitoring is advised but can be done at home if rental remote monitoring device is equipped. Certain surveillance such as measurement of uterine height, abdominal circumference, weight, fetal movement, and blood pressure can be done at home. In addition, online courses and medical consultations that offer medical advice such as antenatal checkup plan, pregnancy management, self\u2010monitor, and self\u2010protection are available through live broadcasting, online chatting, and social media platforms for pregnant women.\n3.2 Patient triage based on risk level\nTo prevent nosocomial infection and superspreading event, we built up strict triage and admission systems. All patients visiting our hospital follow a standard triage procedure (Figure 1). At the first visit, all nonemergency patients are asked to line\u2010up in the outdoor area with at least 1\u2009m distance between themselves for an epidemiological evaluation,23 unless they claim to have contact history and demand a direct visit to fever clinic. The criteria of the epidemiological evaluation are recommended by National Health Commission, and it includes24:\n(1)\nTravel or residential histories in Hubei provenience or other areas with a local outbreak or communities that had reported case within the past 14 days;\n(2)\nExposure to those who had travel or residential histories in Hubei or other areas with local outbreak or communities that had reported case within the past 14 days and later presented fever or respiratory symptoms;\n(3)\nExposure to suspected or diagnosed cases within the past 14 days;\n(4)\nExposed to a clustered onset;\n(5)\nRespiratory symptoms and body temperature.\nFigure 1\nOpen in figure viewerPowerPoint\nStandardized procedure for out\u2010patient triage. *Potentially fatal emergencies include but not restricted to severe vaginal bleeding without confirmed pregnancy, parturition, premature rupture of membranes, fetal distress, vaginal bleeding during pregnancy, and abnormal vital signs (except fever)\nIn a protocol issued by the First Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University, as well as the regulation in our hospital at the early stages of the epidemic, those who have any of the above risk factors would be referred to fever clinic.25 However, we soon realized that this might put the majority of patients who were not infected at higher a risk of exposure. Hence, we gradually modified the triage protocol; now those who have the above\u2010mentioned epidemiological histories (1\u20104), or do not have contact history but have respiratory symptoms and fever (temperature\u2009\u2265\u200937.3\u00b0C), will be referred to fever clinic for further checkup. Patients who do not have contact history or fever, but have respiratory symptoms, will be referred to respiratory out\u2010patient department. Those who do not have contact history or respiratory symptom, but present fever, will be referred to emergency internal medicine department for further checkup. Those who pass the screening (low\u2010risk patients) are allowed to visit specialist out\u2010patient departments. In another article written by specialists from Chengdu, Sichuan provenience, they first screen patients through online clinic, those high\u2010risk patients will be directly referred to fever clinic through green channel, and those who do not need urgent medical care will be recommended to postpone their visit or visit a non\u2010antiepidemic hospital. In hospital, they also evaluate patients' symptoms first. If a patient present fever or respiratory symptoms, their contact history in past 14 days will be further investigated, if this patient reports contact history, he/she will be assigned to high\u2010risk fever clinic, and if contact history is denied, the patient will be assigned to low\u2010risk fever clinic. For those who do not have such symptoms will be referred to other departments.26 In a hospital in Nanjing, the first triage only includes temperature check, those who have a fever will be further questioned with epidemiological history, those with both fever and epidemiological history will be assigned to fever clinic, those who only present fever will be refer to respiratory department or other specialists, and if a patient does not have fever, he/she will be allowed into other specialist department.27\nDuring the stay in hospital, face mask is mandatory and will be provided if necessary. Videos and broadcasts of instructions on hand hygiene, seven\u2010step hand\u2010washing, coughing manner, safety distance, the process of visiting doctors, and admission procedure will be played in every waiting section. All nurses in charge of the patient triage will require second\u2010level protection.\nStandardized protection includes three levels:\nFirst level: regular medical face mask, white coat, medical rubber gloves, and hand sanitizer.\nSecond level: disposable cap, surgical mask (medical protective respirator under certain circumstances), protective face shield or goggles, protective clothing outside the work clothing (such as white coat), medical rubber gloves, and hand sanitizer.\nThird level: disposable cap, protective face shield or positive pressure headgear, goggles, medical protective respirator (N95), disposable coverall protective clothing, medical rubber gloves, and disposable shoe covers.\n3.3 Admission procedure for regular patients\nIn case 2 that we presented, the patient was not in an emergency situation, yet she only underwent epidemiological evaluations but not laboratory examination before admission. As a matter of fact, we changed our admission requirements twice before we settled with our current strategy. In the beginning, nonemergency patients who did not have epidemiological history or related symptoms would be admitted directly and those who did would be referred to fever clinic for further checkups. Then, when the epidemic situation got more serious, blood routine and chest CT were required before admission, those who had abnormal results would be further tested with viral nucleic acid. In early February, several cases with unknown origin were reported in Shenzhen, and later on, we also learned that some of these patients presented symptoms earlier than their spreader due to the wide\u2010ranged latent period of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102, making it harder to trace patient's contact history. As the return peak of Spring festival brought back a lot of people with uncertain contact histories, the admission procedure was modified to avoid potential missed diagnosis. Additionally, during the peak of the epidemic, those whose treatment can be postponed were advised to delay their appointment.\nOnce hospitalization is needed, the following procedures have to be done before admission (Figure 2). Viral nucleic acid test (nasopharyngeal swab, reverse\u2010transcription PCR) is now mandatory and free of charge, blood routine test is required, and CT scans are not required for women with ongoing intrauterine pregnancy without contact history and abnormal clinical symptoms but necessary for other conditions.\nFigure 2\nOpen in figure viewerPowerPoint\nStandardized procedure for admission. *Emergencies include but not restricted to suspected ectopic pregnancy with abnormal vital signs, abnormal vaginal bleeding, hyperemesis gravidarum with metabolic disorder parturition, threatened preterm labor. COVID\u201019, coronavirus disease 2019; CT, computed tomography\nPatients without any signs of infection can be admitted. For those whose test results indicate some abnormalities, but the viral nucleic acid test comes out negative, the following should be done. First of all, thorough re\u2010evaluation of contact history, symptoms, and body temperature will be examined. Based on the latest edition of practice guideline issued by National Health Commission, the following criteria need to be taken into consideration to identify a suspected case24:\nContact history (four criteria mentioned in the above section).\nFever or respiratory symptoms.\nTypical CT scan features.\nTypical blood routine test features: normal or reduced peripheral blood leukocyte count and decreased lymphocyte count in early stage of the disease.\nIf a patient has any of the four forms of contact history and at least two of the three clinical signs or does not have any form of contact history but has all three clinical signs, he/she will be suspected of infection. Meanwhile, in cases of intrauterine pregnant women, CT scans are not required for COVID\u201019 screening before admission. Thus, if a patient reports an epidemiological contact history or clinical symptom, CT scans will be advised. Although radiation dose of chest CT with abdominal protection was considered negligible,28 scans should only be given with pregnant patient's consent after being fully informed with the relative risks. After CT scans, the pregnant women who are suspected of infection will be hospitalized in the appointed isolated single\u2010bed ward and nonpregnant patients will be referred to fever clinic for further diagnosis. It should be noted that generally patients in the early stage of COVID\u201019 present a distinct blood leukocyte change,1 but in cases of pregnant women, the physical change of blood cell component as pregnancy progresses should be taken into account. It is also common phenomena that pregnant women do not show typical clinical presentations in various diseases, and some symptoms such as short breathing, fatigue, and bowel dysfunction may be concealed by pregnancy. Hereby, we are extra cautious with any risk factor when it comes to pregnant women.\nAccording to some practice guidelines in the early stage of the epidemic, if a patient is suspected of COVID\u201019, laboratory exams including influenza A virus, influenza B virus, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydia pneumoniae, respiratory syncytial virus, adenovirus, coxsackievirus, and parainfluenza virus may be given first, and if the abovementioned infections are excluded, SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 nucleic acid should be tested.22, 29 Nonetheless, as nucleic acid test kit production outnumbered the suspected patients in mid\u2010February, we now directly prescribe SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 nucleic acid test. Other pathogens may be used for differential diagnosis if the patient is tested negative for SARS\u2010CoV\u20102.\nOnce viral nucleic acid is tested positive, a diagnosis will be confirmed, and the patient will be immediately informed, quarantined, and transferred to appointed hospitals following \u201cTransport Plan for COVID\u201019 cases (Trial)\u201d issued by National Health Commission.30 Advice on referral of obstetric patients given by Liaoning provenience also suggested that one obstetrician and one nurse are required to accompany the transport of pregnant patient. The ambulance should be equipped with a Doppler stethoscope or a continuous electronic fetal heart monitor. Equipment for delivery shall be provided if necessary.22\n3.4 Admission procedure for emergency patients\nEmergencies such as suspected ectopic pregnancy, severe vaginal bleeding without confirmed pregnancy, parturition, premature rupture of membranes, fetal distress, vaginal bleeding during pregnancy, and abnormal vital signs (except fever) may be referred directly to the in\u2010patient department of gynecology or obstetrics. In these cases, nurses at in\u2010patient department are responsible for finishing epidemiological evaluation, body temperature check, and sample acquiring. Before the possibility of infection is ruled out, all medical performances should be done following quarantine and protection instructions. It should be noted that in many cases of emergencies, treatments need to be performed immediately regardless of the patients' infection status. In these cases, if the infection is diagnosed or cannot be ruled out yet, the patients will be isolated in single\u2010bed ward and if delivery or surgery is needed, delivery or operating room should be informed first and the appointed delivery or operating room should be used only. Aerosol\u2010generating procedures such as general anesthesia with tracheal intubation should be avoided in surgeries if possible.31, 32 During any medical performance given to suspected or diagnosed patient, we use consumable medical material if possible and all recyclable devices will be sterilized after having contact with such patients and all medical and domestic waste are disposed of as infectious waste. Standard third\u2010level protection is required for all staff members who are going to have any sort of contact with these patients. After the surgery or delivery, the patient should be quarantined in the appointed single\u2010bed ward, neonates will be quarantined in neonatal intensive care unit and breastfeeding will be postponed till the possibility of infection is eliminated or the infection is cured. If the diagnosis is confirmed, the patient should be transferred to appointed hospitals after his/her condition is stabilized.\n3.5 Countermeasures for a newly discovered high\u2010risk patient at in\u2010patient department\nAt in\u2010patient departments, temperature checkup three times a day is mandatory for low\u2010risk patients, more frequent checkup may be given according to actual conditions. If body temperature higher than 37.3\u00b0C or respiratory symptom is observed or there is contact history to a newly suspected/diagnosed case or a patient report previously concealed risky contact histories, immediate actions (Figure 3) including a warning to all staff members in the department, informing the patient and his/her family about the situation while offering epidemiological evaluation and self\u2010quarantine advice, quarantine in single\u2010bed ward, blood routine test, and viral nucleic acid test should be taken. CT scans should be given with fully informed consent for pregnant women. Then, all results should be consulted by the appointed COVID\u201019 expert. It should be noted that patients and their family may panic during this process, a thorough conversation that fully informs them about the current situation, the possibility of other causes, and the countermeasures that will be taken can avoid misunderstanding and unnecessary panic.\nFigure 3\nOpen in figure viewerPowerPoint\nStandardized procedure for newly discovered high\u2010risk cases at in\u2010patient department. COVID\u201019, coronavirus disease 2019; CT, computed tomography4 DISCUSSION\nWith the rise in global attention, much has been done to better understand and control COVID\u201019 from various perspectives. Nonetheless, little has been mentioned regarding maternal health care management. It has been well understood that the female body changes drastically during pregnancy. Alterations in cellular immunity such as downregulation of lymphocyte proliferation and activation are primarily aimed at adopting maternal immune tolerance to fetus.33, 34 Nonetheless, these changes also turn the host more vulnerable and susceptible to pathogens. In addition, as the pregnancy progresses, the enlarging uterus leads to elevation of the diaphragm, widening of the chest and thoracic cage, as well as edema in the upper respiratory airway.9 These physical changes may add up to the difficulty to clear secretions and foreign matters such as dust and pathogens,34 which may increase the risk of infection and accelerate the progression of the disease.\nCOVID\u201019 shares very similar transmission routes and clinical manifestations with SARS and MERS. Though the epidemiological data with regard to pregnant women are currently lacking, some specialists from Wuhan suggested that based on clinical observation, COVID\u201019 may result in rapid multiple organ failure and can be as fatal as SARS. Hence, we further review both these diseases. In a study that included 12 pregnant women infected by SARS\u2010CoV in Hong Kong, 3 of whom passed away, 4 out of 7 who were infected in the first trimester had spontaneous miscarriage, 4 out of 5 who presented after 24 gestational week had preterm delivery, and 2 who recovered before labor had intrauterine growth restriction.35 Despite the limited sample size, the results indicated higher fatality rate in pregnant population and adverse potential obstetric outcome.36 In a review that included 11 pregnant MERS patients, 3 died, 2 terminated their pregnancy prematurely due to severe maternal respiratory failure, and 1 had intrauterine fetal death.37 No evidence of in utero transmission was discovered in SARS or MERS,38 and proof of vertical transmission has not been found as well. However, there is a report of neonates being tested positive for SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 after 30 hours of birth.39 Hence, compare to the potential adverse outcome, the cost of effective preventive measures is much lower.\nWith regard to vertical transmission, no solid evidence has been reported so far. In a research that included nine pregnant COVID\u201019 patients who had a cesarean section, breast milk, amniotic fluid, and umbilical cord blood were taken; all samples were tested negative for SARS\u2010CoV\u20102.40 In another study, a patient's breast milk along with serum, urine, feces, amniotic fluid, umbilical cord blood, and placenta samples were tested negative for SARS\u2010CoV\u20102.41 A recent study collected maternal breast milk, serum, cord blood, placental tissue, amniotic fluid, vaginal swab, and newborn's nasopharyngeal swab at or after delivery; all samples were tested negative.42 Despite the lack of evidence of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 existing in breast milk, breastfeeding and breast milk are not recommended for suspected and diagnosed patients due to the following reasons: (a) the limited data cannot rule out the possibility of vertical transmission; (b) neonates or infants should be separated from suspected or diagnosed patients due to the strong infectivity of COVID\u201019; (c) the virus may transfer to milk or the milk bottle during the milking process, giving a chance of exposure even without direct contact with the infected mother. A case reported in 2004 suggested that antibodies to SARS\u2010CoV were detected in maternal serum, cord blood, and breast milk.43 Whether SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 antibodies appear in cord blood, breast milk, and neonatal serum is yet to be known. If they do, whether the benefit of these antibodies overcomes the risk of breastfeeding is also questionable.\nA recent epidemiological research conducted by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) revealed that by 11 February, a total of 3019 health care workers working in medical facilities were infected.44 It was also reported in South Korea that in a psychiatric department with 102 patients and staff, 99 were infected. These alerted us on the risk of nosocomial infection and superspreading event. Despite this risk, the high incidence and fatal outcome of ectopic pregnancy,45 pregnancy complications such as eclampsia,46 as well as congenital malformations caused by genetic or chromosomal defects should not be neglected. Antenatal care during pregnancy significantly reduces adverse maternal and fetal outcomes.19, 47 Thus, canceling these checkups to avoid COVID\u201019 may put pregnant women in a riskier position.\nIsolation has been proven to be an effective way to control the spread of COVID\u201019 by the observation of the epidemic situation in China as well as a mathematical model.48 Thus, although our patients are advised to attend recommended checks on schedule, we are obligated to provide them a safer environment by separating regular, high\u2010risk, suspected, and diagnosed patients with a well\u2010organized managing system. In contrast to the outbreak of SARS in 2003, online platforms are well developed nowadays. These applications enable us to not only better inform, communicate with, and consult our patients, but also answer their doubts, relieve their anxiety, and clear the panic caused by rumors, which significantly reduces unnecessary hospital visit without increasing the risk of complications. Given that 420 patients were diagnosed by 11 March in Shenzhen and tens of cases were diagnosed in our hospital, yet no nosocomial infection has occurred and none of the pregnant woman registered in our hospital was reported to be infected, this management should be effective to an extent; however, a mathematical model may be needed to quantify the effectiveness of these methods. To the best of our knowledge, no pregnant woman was infected in Shenzhen by far. Due to the lack of experience, we are uncertain of the clinical features, disease progress, outcome, and treatment of pregnant COVID\u201019 patients. More work is needed to be done to fill in these gaps in the future.ACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nWe'd like to thank everyone who fight the coronavirus, especially who work on the frontline.

Though molecular diagnostic tests are the gold standard for COVID\u201019, serological testing is emerging as a potential surveillance tool, in addition to its complementary role in COVID\u201019 diagnostics. Indubitably quantitative serological testing provides greater advantages than qualitative tests but today there is still little known about serological diagnostics and what the most appropriate role quantitative tests might play.Methods\nSixty\u2010one COVID\u201019 patients and 64 patients from a control group were tested by iFlash1800 CLIA analyzer for anti\u2010SARS CoV\u20102 antibodies IgM and IgG. All COVID\u201019 patients were hospitalized in San Giovanni di Dio Hospital (Florence, Italy) and had a positive oro/nasopharyngeal swab RT\u2010PCR result.Results\nThe highest sensitivity with a very good specificity performance was reached at a cutoff value of 10.0 AU/mL for IgM and of 7.1 for IgG antibodies, hence near to the manufacturer's cutoff values of 10 AU/mL for both isotypes. The ROC performance curves showed area under the curve (AUC) values of 0.918 and 0.980 for anti\u2010SARS CoV\u20102 antibodies IgM and IgG, respectively.Conclusions\niFlash1800 CLIA analyzer has shown highly accurate results for the anti\u2010SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 antibodies profile and can be considered an excellent tool for COVID\u201019 diagnostics.\nThis article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.", "25822": "Background\nCurrently, the epidemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID\u201019) has begun to spread worldwide. We aim to explore reliable evidence for the diagnosis and treatment of the COVID\u201019 by analyzing all the published studies by Chinese scholars on the clinical and imaging features in novel coronavirus pneumonia caused by SARS\u2010CoV\u20102.Methods\nWe searched five medical databases including two Chinese and three English databases for all published articles on COVID\u201019 since the outbreak. A random\u2010effects model was designed, and the imaging and clinical data from all studies were collected for meta\u2010analysis.Results\nOverall, 31 articles and 46\u2009959 patients were included, including 10 English articles and 21 Chinese articles. The results of meta\u2010analysis showed that the most common clinical manifestations were fever (87.3%; 0.838\u20100.909), cough (58.1%; 0.502\u20100.660), dyspnea (38.3%; 0.246\u20100.520), muscle soreness or fatigue (35.5%; 0.253\u20100.456), and chest distress (31.2%; \u22120.024 to 0.648). The main imaging findings were bilateral pneumonia (75.7%; 0.639\u20100.871) and ground\u2010glass opacification (69.9%; 0.602\u20100.796). Among the patients, the incidence that required intensive care unit (ICU) was (29.3%; 0.190\u20100.395), the incidence with acute respiratory distress syndrome was (28.8%; 0.147\u20100.429), the incidence with multiple organ dysfunction syndrome was (8.5%; \u22120.008 to 0.179), and the case fatality rate of patients with COVID\u201019 was (6.8%; 0.044\u20100.093).Conclusion\nCOVID\u201019 is a new clinical infectious disease that mainly causes bilateral pneumonia and lung function deteriorates rapidly. Nearly a third of patients need to be admitted to the ICU, and patients are likely to present respiratory failure or even death.1 INTRODUCTION\nThe 2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP) initially broke out in China, especially in Hubei province. The NCP is caused by a new coronavirus (SARS\u2010COV\u20102) of the Sarbe virus subgenus, a member of orthocoronavirus subfamily.1 SARS\u2010COV\u20102 is a member of the coronavirus family along with SARS\u2010CoV and MERS\u2010CoV. With the deepening of research, more and more evidence show that its transmission channels are diversified, and its transmission speed and infectivity are stronger than SARS\u2010CoV and MERS\u2010CoV.2-4 Since the outbreak of the epidemic, China has taken active prevention and control measures and achieved good results, but, recently, the epidemic situation abroad has begun to develop into an uncontrollable situation. As of 28 February 2020, the epidemic of NCP has affected six continents, and the epidemic situation in South Korea, Italy, Japan, and other countries is extremely serious. On 29 February, the \u201cChina\u2010WHO NCP (COVID\u201019) Joint Inspection Report\u201d stated that the NCP is almost susceptible to everyone on the same day. On 11 March, the WHO declared the SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 outbreak as pandemic. Currently, published studies and case reports indicate that patients with NCP have very different clinical manifestations, laboratory tests, and imaging tests, making clinical diagnosis and treatment limited. Therefore, it is urgent to improve the understanding of the clinical characteristics of patients with NCP to further guide clinical and scientific research through evidence\u2010based medicine.2 MATERIALS AND METHODS\n2.1 Search strategy and study selection\nThis study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology. The literature search was performed according to the PRISMA (preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta\u2010analyses) process. The search was conducted in five popular medical databases including three English databases (PubMed, Cochrane Library, and Embase) and two Chinese databases (National Knowledge Infrastructure [CNKI] and China Biology Medicine disc [CBMdisc]). The searches were concluded by 1 March 2020. The language limit is English and Chinese. The retrieval is a combination of subject words and free words, and the keywords are as follows: \u201c2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia,\u201d \u201cCOVID\u201019,\u201d \u201cCoronavirus,\u201d \u201cSARS\u2010CoV\u20102,\u201d \u201cWuhan Coronavirus,\u201d \u201cclinical features,\u201d \u201c2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia,\u201d and \u201cimaging features.\u201d\n2.2 Inclusion/exclusion criteria\nInclusive criteria are as follows: (a) research types: cross\u2010sectional studies and case series; (b) research subjects: patients with confirmed NCP, including patients with clinical diagnosis; and (c) data items: including clinical characteristics, biochemical indicators, and imaging signs. Exclusive criteria are as follows: (a) the type of study is case report, review, and so forth; (b) repeated research; and (c) lack of the above case data.\n2.3 Data extraction and paper quality evaluation\nThe titles and abstracts of all retrieved references were independently reviewed by two investigators, and if there was any ambiguity in the search process, the decision was made by a third investigator. (a) The basic characteristics of the included literature are as follows: author, publication date, journal, research type, number of patients, quality score, and so forth. (b) The basic characteristics of the research subjects are as follows: age, sex, comorbidities, clinical manifestations, laboratory test results, imaging manifestations, and so on. The quality of all included literature was assessed using the Institute of Health Economics (IHE) scale.5\n2.4 Statistical analysis\nThe statistical software Stata version 14.0 and Open Meta\u2010Analyst were used for meta\u2010analysis of single\u2010arm studies. We first unified all units of variables and, then, expressed classified variables as percentages and expressed continuous variables as mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard deviation. The combined prevalence and 95% CI were calculated using a random\u2010effects model. We performed the Egger test to assess publication bias in all literature works, and P\u2009<\u2009.05 was considered as publication bias.3 RESULTS\n3.1 Literature inclusion and characteristics\nA total of 956 articles were retrieved. After deleting duplicates, 96 studies remained, of which 860 were excluded based on the title or abstract. Finally, 65 were eliminated after reading the full text, and a total of 31 articles6-36 and 46\u2009959 patients were included in this meta\u2010analysis (Figure 1). The main characteristics of the included studies are shown in Table 1. Publication bias was assessed with a funnel plot for the standard error by logit event, with no evidence of bias. Additionally, the Egger test (P\u2009=\u2009.091) suggested that there was no notable evidence of publication bias.\nFigure 1\nOpen in figure viewerPowerPoint\nDiagram of documents retrieval\nTable 1.

This was followed by dyspnea (38.3%), myalgia or weakness (35.5%), and chest tightness (31.2%), and some patients also presented other clinical symptoms such as chills, cough, conjunctival discomfort, headache, shortness of breath, and joint pain. A few patients had nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and other abdominal discomfort symptoms, whereas very few patients showed hemoptysis symptoms. Most patients with NCP required hospitalization, of which 29.3% required intensive care. The main complications are respiratory failure, ARDS (28.8%) and multiple organ failure (8.5%), and heart failure, shock, renal injury, sepsis, striated muscle lysis, and diffuse intravascular coagulation are rare. According to the severity, the patients with NCP can be divided into mild, normal type (80%), medium type, and severe type (13.8%). The clinical manifestations of patients with different severity vary greatly. According to statistics, the fatality rate in China is about 3.8%,37 lower than that of SARS (9.6%) and MERS (35%). The main causes of death are massive alveolar damage and progressive respiratory failure. Generally, viral pneumonia mainly involves pulmonary interstitium, producing pulmonary interstitial fibrosis. The autopsy report of the first NCP patient in China found that coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID\u201019) mainly caused the inflammatory response characterized by deep airway and alveolar damage, accompanied by a large amount of viscous secretions in the airway. The pulmonary transparent membrane became less obvious, and the degree of fibrosis was not as severe as SARS.38 However, the degree of effect of COVID\u201019 on pulmonary fibrosis still needs to be paid close attention, which is also an important factor influencing pulmonary function in the prognosis of patients with NCP.\nIn this meta\u2010analysis, white blood cells were normal or decreased in most patients, lymphocytes were mostly decreased, and CRP, LDH, ESR level was elevated in some patients. A few patients had elevated creatine kinase procalcitonin bilirubin, whereas some had decreased albumin and elevated ALT, AST. The pathological results of patients with SARS\u2010COV\u20102 suggested that the excessive activation of T lymphocytes, which is characterized by increased Th17 cells and high toxicity of CD8+ T cells, has caused severe immune damage to a certain extent.4 This may be the main reason for the loss of lymphocytes in patients. Sequence comparison analysis showed that the S spike protein of SARS\u2010COV\u20102 contains a SARS\u2010CoV\u2010like receptor binding domain, which indicates that ACE2 may be the main receptor of SARS\u2010COV\u20102.3 ACE2 was highly expressed in gastric and testicular epithelial cells, and also enriched in colon, heart, kidney, and so on. Over\u2010expressed ACE2 may be related to the elevated liver enzyme.39 The similarity of SARS\u2010COV\u20102 and SARS\u2010CoV gene sequences suggests that the mechanism of action may also be similar. SARS\u2010COV\u20102 enters host cells through dense S protein,40, 41 acts on bronchial epithelial cells through ACE2 receptor, and then infects other cells, causing a series of immune responses or inflammatory cytokine storm in severe cases. In addition, the sequence alignment showed that the SARS\u2010COV\u20102 and SARS\u2010CoV S2 subunits are highly conserved, and the overall identity in the HR1 and HR2 domains is 92.6% and 100%, respectively. This suggested that novel coronary pneumonia drugs research may base on this site.42\nIn imaging results, this meta\u2010analysis showed that 75.7% of the patients had lesions involving both lungs, and 69.9% showed ground\u2010glass shadows on imaging, mostly interstitial pulmonary lesions. Chest CT showed consolidation shadow nodular or patchy shadow in some patients, whereas there also existed other characteristics in few patients, such as chest\u2010shaped shadows, thick cord\u2010like shadows, pleural reactions, thickened blood vessels, pleural effusion, and bronchial inflation, subpleural line, halo sign, antihalo sign, mosaic sign, and so on. The course of the critically ill patient progressed rapidly, and chest CT could cause \u201cwhite lung\u201d changes within a few days. Because the sensitivity of nucleic acid test is closely related to the detection sample and testing the sample of lower respiratory tract is more sensitive,43 nucleic acid test shows partial false negative result. Chest CT examination, as an important examination method for NCP, is highly sensitive to SARS\u2010COV\u20102 (even up to 97% in epidemic areas) and is an important supplement to nucleic acid detection.44 In patients with negative nucleic acid test reports, chest CT results are still of high auxiliary diagnostic value. In addition, imaging manifestations of patients also show dynamic evolution in the course of disease progression.\nCurrent research showed that COVID\u201019, which source may be Chinese chrysanthemum head bats and pangolin may be a potential intermediate host, can cause a zoonotic disease.3 Since late February 2020, the number of confirmed cases of NCP abroad has increased rapidly, which may indicate a pandemic. The \u201cthree early\u201d principle (early detection, early diagnosis, and early treatment) followed by disease prevention and treatment is particularly important in the prevention and treatment of SARS\u2010COV\u20102. In addition, the clinical manifestations of patients with neocoronary pneumonia are diverse and the atypical symptoms also account for part of the proportion. Therefore, we systematically analyzed the clinical manifestations and auxiliary examination results of patients with COVID\u201019, so as to reflect the disease characteristics more comprehensively, increase the discrimination of the disease, and strive for early diagnosis, early isolation, and early treatment.\nThe number of newly diagnosed cases of NCP has been rising worldwide recently, especially in South Korea, Italy, Iran, and Japan. To control the further spread of the epidemic, it is still necessary to strictly follow the management measures for the prevention and treatment of infectious diseases and follow the WHO declaration on public health emergencies of international concern. Certainly, prevention of imported cases is also extremely important.45 Particularly, in some densely populated markets, stations, large ports, and other places, protective deployment measures should be strengthened to ensure that protective equipment, drugs, medical supplies, and so on are sufficient.46 National public health capabilities and infrastructure remain at the core of global health security, as they are the first line of defense for infectious disease emergencies.47 The International Health Organization, all countries, and all humanity need to pay great attention to SARS\u2010COV\u20102.\nThis meta\u2010analysis, with large enough sample size, relatively high literature quality, and more comprehensive analysis, included a total of 31 literature studies, including 46\u2009959 patients with NCP. The conclusions are very credible to some extent. This article still has the following limitations, for example, (a) the samples are domestic cases, without foreign cases; (b) different data sources may lead to some bias in the results; and (c) there exists some publication bias. Therefore, the conclusions of this article need to be further verified.5 CONCLUSION\nCOVID\u201019 is a new clinical infectious disease, which mainly causes bilateral pneumonia and lung function deteriorates rapidly. Nearly a third of patients need to be admitted to the ICU, and patients are likely to present respiratory failure or even death.ACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nWe are grateful to all the medical staff who worked on the front line to fight the epidemic and even gave their precious lives.

In severe novel coronavirus pneumonia cases, the number of platelets, their dynamic changes during the treatment, platelet\u2010to\u2010lymphocyte ratio (PLR) were a concern. We sought to describe the platelet feature of these cases. Single\u2010center case series of the 30 hospitalized patients with confirmed coronavirus disease (COVID)\u201019 in Huizhou municipal central hospital from January 2020 to February 2020 were retrospectively analyzed. Demographic, clinical, blood routine results, other laboratory results, and treatment data were collected and analyzed. Outcomes of severe patients and nonsevere patients were compared. Univariate analysis showed that: age, platelet peaks, and PLR at peak platelet were the influencing factors in severe patients, multivariate analysis showed that the PLR value at peak platelet during treatment was an independent influencing factor in severe patients. The average hospitalization day of patients with platelet peaks during treatment was longer than those without platelet peaks (P\u2009<\u2009.05). The average age of patients with platelet peaks during treatment was older than those without platelet peaks (P\u2009<\u2009.05). The patients with significantly elevated platelets during treatment had longer average hospitalization days. And the higher PLR of patients during treatment had longer average hospitalization days. Single\u2010center case series of the 30 hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID\u201019 in Huizhou Municipal Central Hospital, presumed that the number of platelets and their dynamic changes during the treatment may have a suggestion on the severity and prognosis of the disease. The patient with markedly elevated platelets and longer average hospitalization days may be related to the cytokine storm. The PLR of patients means the degree of cytokine storm, which might provide a new indicator in the monitoring in patients with COVID\u201019.1 INTRODUCTION\nIn December 2019, pneumonia cases of unknown origins, known as novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP), occurred in Wuhan, Hubei province, China. The World Health Organization has recently officially named NCP as coronavirus disease in 2019 (COVID\u201019).1 In the following month, the disease spread rapidly from Wuhan to other cities. So far, more than 70\u2009000 COVID\u201019 cases have been confirmed in China. Internationally, cases have been reported in 24 countries and 5 continents. Patients' clinical manifestations mainly included fever, fatigue, nonproductive cough, and dyspnea. Patients' laboratory examinations included normal or reduced leukocyte count, reduced lymphocyte count, thrombocytopenia, elevated transaminase, elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), elevated creatine kinase, and elevated myoglobin. Reduced lymphocyte count can occur in some severe cases.2 At present, there is no effective therapy for COVID\u201019. Therefore, the group of diseases and the assessment of prognosis become more and more important.3 The severity of diseases was according to the COVID\u201019 diagnosis and treatment scheme issued by the National Health Committee. Patients were divided into four groups, including light groups, medium groups, severe groups, and critically ill groups.\nHowever, platelet\u2010to\u2010lymphocyte ratio (PLR) of COVID\u201019 between severe and nonsevere cases were not fully reported, which may have prognostic values and be important therapeutic targets. In this study, the number of platelets, their dynamic changes during the treatment, PLR of 30 laboratory\u2010confirmed cases admitted to Huizhou Municipal Central Hospital was showed, the difference between severe and nonsevere cases was investigated.2 METHODS\nThirty patients with confirmed COVID\u201019 admitted to Huizhou Municipal Central Hospital from January 2020 to February 2020 were enrolled. This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Huizhou Municipal Central Hospital (Huizhou, China). The diagnosis of COVID\u201019 was according to National Health Committee guidance and confirmed by RNA detection of the 2019\u2010nCoV in the Chinese Center for Disease Prevention and Control. Only the laboratory\u2010confirmed cases were included in the analysis. All the patients were at least 18 years of age. Patients with chronic lung diseases, hematological diseases, liver disease, having undergone radiotherapy and chemotherapy were excluded. The composite endpoint of the study was 21 February 2019. Finally, 30 discharged patients met the above criteria and were included in this study.\nAccording to the COVID\u201019 diagnosis and treatment scheme issued by the National Health Committee, signs, symptoms, and comorbidities, patients were divided into severe cases and nonsevere cases. Clinical condition assessment criteria: according to the COVID\u201019 diagnosis and treatment plan issued by the National Health Committee of China, clinical classification is performed, which is divided into four types: light, ordinary, heavy, and critical. Mild: mild clinical symptoms, no pneumonia on imaging; common: fever, respiratory tract symptoms, and pneumonia on imaging; severe: meet any of the following: (a) shortness of breath, RR\u2009>\u200930 times/min; (b) resting state, means oxygen saturation\u2009\u2264\u200993%; (c) partial pressure of arterial oxygen (PaO2)/oxygen concentration (FiO2)\u2009\u2264\u200930\u2009mm\u2009Hg (1\u2009mm\u2009Hg=\u20090.133\u2009kPa), pulmonary imaging shows that the lesions have progressed significantly within 50 to 48\u2009hours, and those who are more than 50% are managed as heavy; critical: meet any of the following: (a) have respiratory failure and require mechanical ventilation; (b) have body weight; (c) combined with other organ failure requires ICU monitoring and treatment.\nAccording to COVID\u201019 guidance by the National Health Committee, patients receive effective oxygen therapies including a nasal catheter, mask oxygen and high\u2010flow oxygen therapy on the whole. Lopinavir was available. Treatment measures of severe cases and critically ill cases were different from nonsevere cases. On the basis of symptomatic treatment, preventing complications, preventing secondary infections, respiratory support, circulatory support was necessary. Symptomatic treatment was given in cases of reduced lymphocyte count and thrombocytopenia.\nThe information recorded included demographic data, medical history, symptoms, signs, laboratory findings, chest computed tomographic scans, and treatment measures. The samples for peripheral blood were collected on admission and during the hospital stay. Lymphocytes, platelets, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, and LDH were detected in the clinical laboratory of Huizhou Municipal Central Hospital. On the basis of the patients' blood routine, PLR was calculated. Multivariate analysis of independent risk factors and relationship between PLR and prognosis.\nData are presented as mean and standard deviation unless stated otherwise. The nonparametric two\u2010tailed Student t test was used to analyze variables. Differences in values between tested groups were regarded as significant at a value of P\u2009\u2264\u2009.05. Correlation analysis used simple linear correlation, multifactor logistic regression analysis. Data were analyzed using SPSS 25. The optimal cut\u2010off value, sensitivity (sensitivity), and specificity (specificity) of PLR were determined by analysis of receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. The statistical graphs were drawn using GraphPad Prism 6 software.3 RESULTS\n3.1 Demographic characteristics\nThere were a total of 30 patients admitted with a median age of 50.5 years (36\u201065 years), including 16 males and 14 females. There were 27 cases in the nonsevere group and 3 cases in the severe group. Patients in the severe group are older.\n3.2 Correlation analysis between nonsevere patients and severe patients\nThe correlation between two groups in terms of age, length of hospitalization, the absolute value of lymphocytes, platelets, and so on are shown in Table 1 and Figures 1 and 2. Table 1 shows the difference between nonsevere group and severe group in the average age (49.44 vs 60 years) and the average length of hospitalization (15.33 vs 27 days), the statistics of two groups was statistical significance (P\u2009<\u2009.05). We also analyze some other indicators between the two groups, such as platelet value, absolute lymphocyte values, PLR, ALT, and AST, LDH at admission. But there are no significance between them. Unexpectedly, comparing the peak of platelet, it was found that the average platelet peak during the treatment of severe patients was 392\u2009\u00d7\u2009109/L, which was significantly higher than the nonsevere patients at 301\u2009\u00d7\u2009109/L. The PLR was 626, which was significantly higher than the PLR of nonsevere patients, which was 262. The date of the two groups was statistically significant (P\u2009<\u2009.05). In terms of hormone use, a total of 18 nonsevere patients used hormones during treatment, accounting for 66.7% of nonsevere patients, and 3 of the severe patients had used hormones, accounting for 100%, but these two groups of data have no statistical significance. Multivariate logistic regression analysis of age, platelet peak, and PLR at platelet peak during treatment showed that PLR at platelet peak during treatment was an independent influencing factor for critically ill patients.

The data are shown in Table 4. The average \u0394PLR in severe patients was 466.24\u2009\u00b1\u2009471.86, while in nonsevere patients was 19.61\u2009\u00b1\u2009130.40. By comparison, we found that the patients' \u0394PLR was correlated with the length of hospitalization day. If \u0394PLR increased more during treatment, the patient had longer hospitalization day and a greater possibility of severe pneumonia. On the contrary, if \u0394PLR increased less during treatment, the patient had shorter hospitalization day endless possibility of severe pneumonia, as shown in Figure 4. By drawing the ROC curve, we can know that the cut\u2010off value of \u0394PLR is 126.7, the sensitivity is 100%, the specificity is 81.5% (P\u2009=\u2009.014). In clinical treatment, when the PLR value is greater than 126.7, we should raise our vigilance, patients may appear to increase the length of hospital stay and worsen the condition.\nTable 4.

Patients may gradually develop dyspnea. In severe cases, the disease progresses rapidly. MODS, septic shock, difficult to correct metabolic acidosis, and coagulation dysfunction may occur within a few days. Some patients have severe inflammatory storms leading to death.4 Therefore, judging the development trend and prognosis of the disease at an early stage, and taking active and effective treatment for patients who may develop into severe illness can effectively reduce the mortality rate.\nThere are so many similarities between the outbreak of COVID\u201019 originated from Wuhan and SARS in Guangdong province in 2003. For example, they both occurred in winter and originated from the contact between live animals in the human\u2010animal trading market and caused by an unknown coronavirus. Compared with SARS, they both are caused by human coronavirus infection. Although there are significant differences between 2019\u2010nCOV and SARS\u2010CoV in genetic characteristics, there are still many similarities in physical and chemical characteristics.5, 8 A retrospective analysis of SARS patients showed that 68% to 90% of diagnosed patients had peripheral lymphocytopenia, 20% to 45% had thrombocytopenia, and 20% to 34% had leukopenia.9 Platelets are important immune cells in the human body, which play an important role in hemostasis, coagulation, vascular integrity maintenance, angiogenesis, innate immunity, inflammatory response, tumor biology and so on. Changes in its number and activity are closely related to a variety of diseases.10, 11 Platelets are produced by mature megakaryocytes in the bone marrow, and current studies have shown that a variety of cytokines, including TPO, IL\u20103, IL\u20106, IL\u20109, IL\u201011, and stem cell factor (SCF), can promote the production of megakaryocytes. In vitro experiments, the addition of mixed cytokines can stimulate the generation of megakaryocytes. SCF plays an important role in promoting the proliferation of megakaryocytes at the early stage of differentiation, while IL\u20103 and TP0 play a synergistic role in the differentiation of megakaryocytes. In state of inflammation, IL\u20106 can promote the generation of megakaryocytes by stimulating the increase of TPO level.12, 15 The absolute value of lymphocytes and platelet levels can be used as sensitive indicators to reflect the body's infection and inflammation control. But can these indicators have the same clinical value for COVID\u201019?\nTherefore, we analyzed the changes in peripheral blood of the COVID\u201019 patients in 2019, and the association between the changes and the survival and prognosis of the patients. According to a report by Zhongnan Hospital affiliated to Wuhan University,16 the total number of white blood cells in the peripheral blood of these patients in the early stage of the disease was normal or decreased, while the lymphocyte count was decreased. Liver damage and elevated inflammatory markers can occur in some patients. Our results show that the lymphocyte level at admission is related to the prognosis. The older patients with a lower count of lymphocyte and platelet suffered more severe disease and stay in a longer hospital. Our results showed that the age and the platelet level of patients were positively correlated with the length of stay\u2010in hospital, which was consistent with previous results, while the lymphocyte level was negatively correlated with the length of in the hospital, which was in contrast to previous reports. The reason may be that the patient's condition was stable on admission, but they progressed further during treatment. In addition, it may be also related to the limited number of severe patients enrolled in this study. Routine changes in patients with COVID\u201019 are not the manifestations of common viral infection. Leukopenia, neutropenia and an increase in lymphocyte proportion are not significantly changed in patients with a conventional general viral infection, but the COVID\u201019 blood routine changes differently.\nPrevious studies have shown that severe infections, immune\u2010related factors, and other factors cause secondary thrombocytopenia, such as DIC, TTP, and HLH, which are characterized by rapid platelet decline.17 Through the observation of patients included, we found that platelets increased first and then decreased in severe patients during treatment and there were six patients with significantly increased platelets, who were generally older and had longer hospital stays. Therefore, we speculated that the changes in platelets in the treatment course may be correlated with the progression and prognosis of COVID\u201019.\nThe possible causes of platelet changes in COVID\u201019 patients were analyzed as follows: (a) coronavirus directly invaded hematopoietic cells or bone marrow stromal cells, leading to hematopoietic inhibition.18 (b) Previous studies have shown that the lung may be one of the organs in which mature megakaryocytes release platelets and that thrombocytopenia in patients with SARS\u2010CoV infection may be associated with lung damage.19, 20 Extensive alveolar damage both occurred in patients with COVID\u201019 and SARS, and lung tissue damage was induced by a viral infection and high flow of oxygen. Injury of lung tissue and pulmonary endothelial cells can lead to activation, aggregation, and retention of platelets in the lung, and the formation of thrombus at the injured site, which may lead to the depletion of platelets and megakaryocytes, resulting in decreased platelet production and increased consumption.20, 21 (c) Huang et al22 believed that patients with COVID\u201019 had a large amount of IL\u20101, IFN\u2010\u03b3, IP\u201010, MCP\u20101, and other cytokines released, which may lead to Th1 activation. However, compared with nonsevere patients, severe cases had higher concentrations of cytokines such as G\u2010CSF, IP\u201010, MCP\u20101, MIP\u20101, and TNF\u2010\u03b1, suggesting that cytokine storm is related to the severity of the disease. However, unlike SARS\u2010CoV infection, 2019\u2010nCoV infection also causes increased secretion of Th2 cytokines that inhibit Th1, such as IL\u20104 and IL\u201010. In our results, in severe cases, the platelet significantly increased during treatment, which may be linked to the release of a large number of cytokines by the immune system. Infection with 2019\u2010nCoV causes cytokine storms in body fluids, aggravating the patient's inflammatory response and stimulating the release of platelets, which often indicates a poor prognosis.23, 24 Of course, if the conditions permit, high\u2010throughput cytokine detection for COVID\u201019 patients to judge whether they are over immune activated, it will be very convincing. However, because there is no 3P laboratory in the Huizhou area that can send such special infected blood samples for examination, so the testing for this item has to be abandoned. The difference is not founded from the analysis of simple blood routine numerical data. It is hoped that the future research direction is the correlation between blood routine changes and cytokines. The correlation between cytokine storm severity and prognosis may be one of the mechanisms of COVID\u201019, which is involved in the occurrence, development, and prognosis of COVID\u201019, providing a new idea for the treatment of COVID\u201019.25, 26 However, there are many factors that affect platelet changes in the clinic. All patients in this study did not use invasive procedures such as tracheal intubation and deep vein catheterization. Therefore, the impact of invasive procedures on platelet changes was not considered in this article.27 It can be seen from the foregoing that the use of hormones during the treatment of patients is not significantly different between severe and nonsevere patients, so their effects on platelets can also be ruled out.\nAs a new type of inflammation index, PLR mainly reflects the level of systemic inflammation. Previous studies have confirmed that PLR is closely related to tumors, diabetes, coronary heart disease, and connective tissue diseases, and the increase of PLR is related to tumor size, lymph node infiltration, distant metastasis and prognosis, and can be used as a potential inflammatory indicator for the clinical diagnosis of community\u2010acquired pneumonia.28 As an indicator of inflammation, PLR is mainly caused by megakaryocytes in bone marrow hematopoietic tissue and is a major participant in thrombosis. It plays a crucial role in the inflammatory response to recruit neutrophils and other inflammatory cells to the site of injury. PLT exists in an inactive form and can be activated quickly at the site of vascular injury, and can be rapidly activated in response to proinflammatory cytokine or infectious factors. The activation of platelets by this mechanism, even without any vascular damage, opens up new functions of platelets, namely inflammation and immune regulation, and the proinflammatory cytokine activity of PLT is mediated by its interaction with other leukocytes in the circulation, followed by the release of cytokines and chemokine to promote inflammation.29 Lymphocytes are the main immune\u2010active cells in the human body, and lymphocyte count is an early marker of physiological stress and systemic inflammation. Platelet\u2010released platelet factor\u20104 can prevent agglutinin\u2010A from inhibiting lymphocyte generation, and activated platelets enhance lymphocyte adhesion to the endothelium, thereby promoting lymphocyte homing in endothelial veins and migration to inflammatory sites. PLR refers to the ratio of the platelet\u2010to\u2010lymphocyte count. The advantage of PLR selection is that it reflects both aggregation and inflammatory pathways, and maybe more valuable in predicting various inflammations than platelet or lymphocyte counts alone.\nThe pathogenesis of COVID\u201019 is also related to the virus\u2010induced inflammatory response in vivo.30-32 According to the current clinical and relevant data, patients with lower lymphocyte levels at the first diagnosis are more seriously ill, and the progressive decline in lymphocyte proportion indicates a poor prognosis. According to prior analysis, we propose the PLR as an indicator which reflects the severity of inflammation in the process of treatment, by comparing the changes of PLR during treatment, we found that the higher the \u0394PLR, the longer the hospital stay they were, of which showed a linear correlation. Therefore, we speculated that the changes in the platelet/lymphocyte ratio in peripheral blood during treatment could reflect the disease progression and prognosis of COVID\u201019 patients. The larger the \u0394PLR, the more severe the cytokine storm, and the longer the hospital stay, the worse the prognosis. When \u0394PLR increases in severe patients, we increase thymosin to regulate immune to elevate lymphocyte therapy to improve this situation, to prevent the development of severe patients or promote the improvement of symptoms in severe patients. After active symptomatic treatment, all three severe patients were successfully treated and successfully discharged from the hospital! The results of this treatment also seem to confirm our conjecture. We also calculated the cut\u2010off value of \u0394PLR. When \u0394PLR\u2009>\u2009126.7, we must actively intervene to prevent further deterioration of the disease. However, due to the lack of clinical data, this conclusion may be biased, and a larger number of samples are needed for further confirmation.5 CONCLUSION\nSingle\u2010center case series of the 30 hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID\u201019 in Huizhou Municipal Central Hospital, presumed that the number of platelets and their dynamic changes during the treatment may have a suggestion on the severity and prognosis of the disease. The patient with markedly elevated platelets and longer average hospitalization days may be related to the cytokine storm. The PLR of patients means the degree of cytokine storm, which might provide a new indicator in the monitoring in patients with COVID\u201019.CONFLICT OF INTERESTS\nAll authors declare that there are no conflict of interests.AUTHOR CONTRIBUTION\nThe authors of the manuscript declare contribution to the study.", "25955": "", "25904": "", "25838": "", "25941": "", "25922": "", "25875": "", "25731": "1 INTRODUCTION\nOn 11 February 2020, the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses officially renamed the novel coronavirus (ie, previously 2019\u2010nCoV) responsible for the current outbreak of COVID\u201019, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS\u2010CoV\u20102). This was chosen based on analysis of the new coronavirus's evolutionary history and associated pathogen (ie, SARS\u2010CoV). The virus, which emerged in December 2019 in the Chinese city of Wuhan, causes a respiratory illness called COVID\u201019, which can spread from person to person.1, 2 As of 21 February 2020, there have been 76\u2009288 cases of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 confirmed in mainland China, including 11\u2009477 serious, 2\u2009345 deaths, and 20\u2009659 discharged, as well as 68 cases in Hong Kong, 10\u2009in Macao, and 26\u2009in Taiwan. More than 1300 cases have also been confirmed in at least 27 other countries on four continents. World Health Organization (WHO) officials outlined their top research priorities for controlling the outbreak of the coronavirus\u2010associated disease known as COVID\u201019 and highlighted the importance of developing candidate therapeutics and easy\u2010to\u2010apply diagnostics for identifying active, asymptomatic, and resolved infections. Of note, the Coronaviridae family not only includes SARS\u2010CoV\u20102, but also SARS\u2010CoV, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS\u2010CoV), and common cold viruses (eg, 229E, OC43, NL63, and HKU1).3 The SARS\u2010CoV pathogen was responsible for >8\u2009000 cases and 774 deaths in 37 countries during the 2002 to 2003 SARS outbreak,4-6 and the MERS\u2010CoV pathogen was responsible for 2\u2009494 cases and 858 deaths in 27 countries during the 2012 MERS outbreak.7, 8\nCoronaviruses are known to circulate in mammals and birds. Previous studies revealed that both SARS\u2010CoV and MERS\u2010CoV are zoonotic in origin, originally coming from bats,9-12 with SARS\u2010CoV spreading from bats to palm civets to humans,13-15 and MERS\u2010CoV spreading from bats to camels to humans.16, 17 Recent research has also reported that the SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 virus likely originated in bats, a proposal based on the similarity of its genetic sequence to that of other known coronaviruses.18 However, like SARS\u2010CoV, MERS\u2010CoV, and many other coronaviruses, the SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 virus may have been transmitted to humans by an intermediate animal host.19 Therefore, the identity of the animal source of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 remains a key and urgent question. Furthermore, to stem future outbreaks of this type and preventing the transmission of zoonotic diseases to humans should be a top research priority.\nThe existence of an intermediate animal host of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 between a probable bat reservoir and humans is still under investigation. The discovery of a virus closely related to the newly emerged SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 in a data set from pangolins sampled more than a year ago illustrates that the sampling of other mammals handled or consumed by humans could uncover even more closely related viruses.20\nDuring a press conference on 7 February 2020, two researchers (Shen Yongyi and Xiao Lihua) from the South China Agricultural University in Guangzhou identified the pangolin as a potential source of the SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 virus based on genetic comparison of coronaviruses taken from pangolins and from humans infected during the recent outbreak. By analyzing more than 1\u2009000 metagenomic samples and using molecular biology testing, they found that the positive rate of \u03b2 coronavirus in pangolins was 70% and that the genome sequence of an isolated virus strain was 99% similar to that of the SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 virus. Thus, whether pangolins acted as a direct intermediate animal host of the SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 virus is worth further investigation.\nIn the present study, we performed analyses of the transmission dynamics and evolutionary history of the virus based on 70 genomes of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 strains sampled from Australia (n\u2009=\u20094), Belgium (n\u2009=\u20091), China (Hubei Province, n\u2009=\u200919; Guangdong Province, n\u2009=\u200916; Zhejiang Province, n\u2009=\u20094; Taiwan, n\u2009=\u20091), Finland (n\u2009=\u20091), France (n\u2009=\u20094), Germany (n\u2009=\u20091), Japan (n\u2009=\u20091), Korea (n\u2009=\u20091), Singapore (n\u2009=\u20093), Thailand (n\u2009=\u20092), United Kingdom (n\u2009=\u20092), and United States (n\u2009=\u200910) with sampling dates between 24 December 2019 and 3 February 2020. We reanalyzed two of the 21 pangolin metagenome samples from previously published data20 and compared the amino acid sequences of the S protein of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 and SARS\u2010related coronaviruses. These analyses should extend our understanding of the origins and dynamics, cross\u2010species transmission, and subsequent host adaptation of the SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 outbreak in China and elsewhere.2 MATERIALS AND METHODS\n2.1 Collation of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 genome data sets\nAs of 9 February 2020, 73 genomes of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 strains obtained from humans have been released on GISAID (http://gisaid.org/).21 The BetaCoV/Wuhan/IPBCAMS\u2010WH\u201002/2019 (EPI_ISL_403931), BetaCoV/Shenzhen/SZTH\u2010001/2020 (EPI_ISL_406592), and BetaCoV/Shenzhen/SZTH\u2010004/2020 (EPI_ISL_406595) samples show evidence of sequencing artefacts due to the appearance of clustered spurious single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and were thus excluded from this study. The final data set (\u201cdataset_70\u201d) included 70 genomes of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 strains from Australia (n\u2009=\u20094), Belgium (n\u2009=\u20091), China (n\u2009=\u200940), Finland (n\u2009=\u20091), France (n\u2009=\u20094), Germany (n\u2009=\u20091), Japan (n\u2009=\u20091), Korea (n\u2009=\u20091), Singapore (n\u2009=\u20093), Thailand (n\u2009=\u20092), UK (n\u2009=\u20092), and USA (n\u2009=\u200910) with sampling dates between 24 December 2019 and 3 February 2020. Of the 40 samples collected from China, 19 were from Hubei Province, 16 were from Guangdong Province, 4 were from Zhejiang Province, and 1 was from Taiwan (Table S1).\nTo investigate the potential intermediate hosts of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 (between originating animal and human hosts), two samples (SRR10168377 and SRR10168378) obtained from previously reported Malayan pangolin (Manis javanica) viral metagenomic sequencing data (Bio Project PRJNA573298) were downloaded from the NCBI SRA public database.20 After assembly, the SRR10168377 and SRR10168378 genomes were 16\u2009999 and 6\u2009392\u2009bp\u2009in length, respectively. We defined another data set (\u201cdataset_6\u201d) composed of six genome sequences of coronavirus strains. BetaCoV/Wuhan\u2010Hu\u20101/2019 (EPI_ISL_402125) was grouped as \u201cClade A,\u201d one (BetaCoV/bat/Yunnan/RaTG13/2013; EPI_ISL_402131) and two (bat\u2010SL\u2010CoVZC45; MG772933 and bat\u2010SL\u2010CoVZXC21; MG772934) SARS\u2010related coronaviruses were grouped as \u201cClade B\u201d and \u201cClade D,\u201d respectively. The two assembled genomes from SRR10168377 and SRR10168377 were grouped into \u201cClade C.\u201d The two data sets (\u201cdataset_70\u201d and \u201cdataset_6\u201d) were aligned using MAFFT v7.22222 and then manually curated using BioEdit v7.2.5.23\n2.2 Recombination and phylogenetic analyses\nTo assess the recombination of \u201cdataset_70,\u201d we employed the pairwise homoplasy index (PHI) to measure the similarity between closely linked sites using SplitsTree v4.15.1.24 The best\u2010fit nucleotide substitution models for the two data sets were identified according to the Bayesian information criterion (BIC) method with 3 (24 candidate models) or 11 (88 candidate models) substitution schemes in jModelTest v2.1.10.25 To evaluate the phylogenetic signals of \u201cdataset_70\u201d and \u201cdataset_6,\u201d we performed likelihood\u2010mapping analysis26 using TREE\u2010PUZZLE v5.3,27 with 25\u2009000 to 175\u2009000 randomly chosen quartets for the two data sets. For \u201cdataset_70,\u201d split network analysis was performed using Kishino\u2010Yano\u201085 distance transformation with the NeighborNet method, which can be loosely thought of as a \u201chybrid\u201d between the neighbor\u2010joining (NJ) and split decomposition methods, implemented in TREE\u2010PUZZLE v5.3. For \u201cdataset_70,\u201d NJ28 phylogenetic trees were constructed using the Kimura 2\u2010parameter method29 implemented in MEGA v7.0.26.30 For \u201cdataset_6,\u201d NJ28 phylogenetic trees were constructed using the Maximum Composite likelihood (MCL) method,31 and rate variation among sites was modeled with a gamma distribution (shape parameter\u2009=\u20094) in MEGA v7.0.26.30 For \u201cdataset_70,\u201d maximum\u2010likelihood (ML) phylogenies were reconstructed using the Hasegawa\u2010Kishino\u2010Yano (HKY)29 nucleotide substitution model in PhyML v3.1.32 For \u201cdataset_6,\u201d ML phylogenies were reconstructed using the general time reversible33 nucleotide substitution model with gamma\u2010distributed rate variation among sites (GTR\u2009+\u2009G) model in PhyML v3.1.32 For all NJ and ML phylogenies of the two data sets, bootstrap support values were calculated with 1\u2009000 replicates34 and trees were midpoint rooted. For \u201cdataset_70,\u201d regression analyses were used to determine the correlations among sampling dates and root\u2010to\u2010tip genetic divergences of the respective ML phylogenies with TempEst v1.5.35 We also estimated the evolutionary rate and time to the most recent common ancestor (TMRCA) for \u201cdataset_70\u201d using ML dating in the TreeTime package.36\n2.3 Reconstruction of time\u2010scaled phylogenies\nTo reconstruct the evolutionary history of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102, Bayesian inference through a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) framework was implemented in BEAST v1.8.4,37 with the BEAGLE v2.1.2 library program38 used for computational enhancement. We used two schemes to set the time\u2010scale prior for each data set: that is, constrained evolutionary rate method with a log\u2010normal prior (mean\u2009=\u20091.0\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u22123 substitutions per site per year; 95% Bayesian credible interval [BCI]: 1.854\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u22124 to 4\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u22123 substitutions per site per year) placed on the evolutionary rate parameter, as per previous studies,39-41 and the tip\u2010dating method, for which the overall estimated evolutionary rate was given an uninformative continuous\u2010time Markov chain (CTMC) reference prior. We ran Bayesian phylogenetic analyses using various clock model combinations (ie, strict clock and uncorrelated log\u2010normal relaxed clock42) and coalescent tree priors (ie, constant size and exponential growth). To ensure adequate mixing of model parameters, MCMC chains were run for 100 million steps with sampling every 10\u2009000 steps from the posterior distribution. Convergence was evaluated by calculating the effective sample sizes of the parameters using Tracer v1.7.1.43 All parameters had an effective sample size >200, indicative of sufficient sampling. Trees were summarized as maximum\u2010clade credibility (MCC) trees using TreeAnnotator v1.8.4 after discarding the first 10% as burn\u2010in, and then visualized in FigTree v1.4.4 (http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/figtree).\n2.4 Transmission network reconstruction\nThe HIV TRAnsmission Cluster Engine (HIV\u2010TRACE; www.hivtrace.org)44 was employed to infer transmission network clusters for SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 \u201cdataset_70.\u201d All pairwise distances were calculated and the putative linkages between each pair of genomes were considered whenever their divergence was \u22640.0001 (0.01%) or \u22640.00001 (0.001%) substitutions/site (TN93 substitution model). Multiple linkages were then combined into putative transmission clusters. Clusters that comprised of only two linked nodes were identified as dyads. This approach detects transmission clusters in which the clustering strains are genetically similar, implying a direct or indirect epidemiological connection.\n2.5 Similarity plot analysis\nTo investigate the putative parents of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102, we performed similarity plot analysis based on the Kimura two\u2010parameter method29 with a window size of 200\u2009bp and step size of 20\u2009bp using SimPlot v.3.5.14.45 We divided \u201cdataset_6\u201d into four clades (ie, Clade A, Clade B, Clade C, and Clade D), with Clade A designated as the query group.3 RESULTS\n3.1 Demographic characteristics of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102\n\u201cDataset_70\u201d included 70 genomes of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 strains sampled from Australia (n\u2009=\u20094), Belgium (n\u2009=\u20091), China (Hubei Province, n\u2009=\u200919; Guangdong Province, n\u2009=\u200916; Zhejiang Province, n\u2009=\u20094; Taiwan, n\u2009=\u20091), Finland (n\u2009=\u20091), France (n\u2009=\u20094), Germany (n\u2009=\u20091), Japan (n\u2009=\u20091), Korea (n\u2009=\u20091), Singapore (n\u2009=\u20093), Thailand (n\u2009=\u20092), UK (n\u2009=\u20092), and USA (n\u2009=\u200910) with sampling dates between 24 December 2019 and 3 February 2020 (Table S1). The samples were primarily from China (57.14%) and Hubei Province (27.14%), the Chinese Province was acknowledged as the original epicenter of the SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 outbreak.\n3.2 Tree\u2010like signals and phylogenetic analyses\nFor \u201cdataset_70\u201d and \u201cdataset_6,\u201d HKY and GTR\u2009+\u2009G were the models of best\u2010fit, respectively, across the two different substitution schemes (ie, 24 and 88 candidate models) according to the BIC method, and were thus used in subsequent likelihood\u2010mapping and phylogenetic analyses for the two data sets. The PHI tests of \u201cdataset_70\u201d did not find statistically significant evidence of recombination (P\u2009=\u20091.0). Likelihood\u2010mapping analysis of \u201cdataset_70\u201d revealed that 69.7% of the quartets were distributed in the center of the triangle, indicating a strong star\u2010like topology signal reflecting a novel virus, which may be due to exponential epidemic spread (Figure 1A). Likewise, 25.9% of the quartets from \u201cdataset_6\u201d were distributed in the center of the triangle, indicating a strong phylogenetic signal (Figure 1B). The split network generated for \u201cdataset_70\u201d using the NeighborNet method was highly unresolved, and the phylogenetic relationship of \u201cdataset_70\u201d was probably best represented by a network rather than a tree (Figure 1C). The existence of polytomies indicated\u2014in contrast to that expected in a strictly bifurcating tree\u2014an explosive, star\u2010like evolution of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102. Both the NJ and ML phylogenetic analyses of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 \u201cdataset_70\u201d also showed star\u2010like topologies, in accordance with the likelihood\u2010mapping results (Figures 2 and S1). The ML phylogenetic tree showed greater star\u2010like topology than the NJ phylogenetic tree, indicating that the ML method was more reasonable for \u201cdataset_70.\u201d Root\u2010to\u2010tip regression analyses between genetic divergence and sampling date using the best\u2010fitting root showed that \u201cdataset_70\u201d had a minor strong positive temporal signal (R2\u2009=\u20090.0808; correlation coefficient\u2009=\u20090.2843) (Figure 3). This result suggests a minor clock\u2010like pattern of molecular evolution, with an estimated substitution rate of 3.3452 \u00d7\u200910\u22124 substitutions per site per year and TMRCA occurring on 19 October 2019. ML dating analyses between genetic divergence and sampling date also showed that \u201cdataset_70\u201d had a minor strong positive temporal signal (R2 =\u20090.08) (Figure S2). The estimated evolutionary rate and TMRCA were 3.34\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u22124 substitutions per site per year and 19 October 2019, respectively, in accordance with the root\u2010to\u2010tip regression results. Based on Bayesian time\u2010scaled phylogenetic analysis using the constrained evolutionary rate method with a log\u2010normal prior (mean\u2009=\u20091.0\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u22123 substitutions per site per year; 95% BCI: 1.854\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u22124 to 4\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u22123 substitutions per site per year) placed on the evolutionary rate parameter, the estimated TMRCA dates and evolutionary rates for SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 from \u201cdataset_70\u201d ranged from 21 May 2019 to 13 October 2019 (95% BCI: 27 and 30 January 2020) and from 1.57\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u22124 to 1.06\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u22123 substitutions per site per year (95% BCI: 1.08\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u22124 to 3.10\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u22123), respectively (Table 1). Furthermore, based on Bayesian time\u2010scaled phylogenetic analysis using the tip\u2010dating method, the estimated TMRCA dates and evolutionary rates from \u201cdataset_70\u201d ranged from 22 to 24 November 2019 (95% BCI: 23 October 2019 and 16 December 2019) and from 1.19\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u22123 to 1.31\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u22123 substitutions per site per year (95% BCI: 6.22\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u22124 to 1.96\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u22123), respectively (Table 1). Thus, the estimated TMRCA dates and evolutionary rates for SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 from \u201cdataset_70\u201d were consistent among the different clock models (strict and relaxed) but were distinct among the different dating methods (constrained\u2010dating and tip\u2010dating). The estimated TMRCA dates and evolutionary rates for SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 from \u201cdataset_70\u201d using the tip\u2010dating method exhibited much narrower 95% BCIs than the constrained\u2010dating method. In addition, the estimated TMRCA dates and evolutionary rates for SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 from \u201cdataset_70\u201d were consistent between the different coalescent tree models (ie, constant and exponential) when using the tip\u2010dating method but were distinct when using the constrained\u2010dating method. For each data set, we employed the HKY nucleotide substitution model, as well as a constant size coalescent tree prior and strict molecular clock model to estimate the TMRCA. The estimates of the MCC phylogenetic relationships among the SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 genomes from the Bayesian coalescent framework using the tip\u2010dating method, as well as the constant size coalescent tree prior and strict molecular clock, are displayed in Figure 4. As shown, eight phylogenetic clusters (number of sequences 2 to 7; posterior probability 0.99 to 1.0) were identified.\nFigure 1\nOpen in figure viewerPowerPoint\nLikelihood\u2010mapping and split network analyses of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS\u2010CoV\u20102).

Based on this, we identified one large transmission cluster that included 66 of 70 (94.29%) genomes, thus suggesting low genetic divergence for \u201cdataset_70\u201d (Figure S3). We also considered individuals as genetically linked when the genetic distance between SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 strains was <0.001% substitutions/site. Based on this, we identified 6 transmission clusters that included 37 of 70 (52.86%) genomes for \u201cdataset_70\u201d (Figure 5). Clusters ranged in size from 2 to 23 genomes.\nFigure 5\nOpen in figure viewerPowerPoint\nTransmission clusters of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS\u2010CoV\u20102).

Nodes (circles) represent connected individuals in overall network, and putative transmission linkages are represented by edges (lines). Nodes are color\u2010coded by sampling locations\n3.4 Potential intermediate host analyses for SARS\u2010CoV\u20102\nThe NJ and ML phylogenetic topologies of \u201cdataset_6\u201d were consistent with each other (Figure S4), indicating that the use of a small number of sequences could show similar topological results. Homology plot analysis of \u201cdataset_6\u201d also revealed that BetaCoV/bat/Yunnan/RaTG13/2013 was more similar to the SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 virus than the coronavirus obtained from the two pangolin samples (SRR10168377 and SRR10168378), consistent with phylogenetic analysis (Figure S5). Of note, \u201cClade D\u201d (bat\u2010SL\u2010CoVZC45 and bat\u2010SL\u2010CoVZXC21) had higher similarity to the SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 virus in the first 12\u2009000\u2009bp region of the full alignment than to the pangolin coronavirus (Figure S5). We also found that a unique peptide (PRRA) insertion region in the spike protein at the junction of S1 and S2 junction in the human SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 virus (\u201cClade A\u201d) induced a furin cleavage motif (RRAR), which could be a predicted polybasic cleavage site, and thus a unique feature of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102, in comparison with the other three clades (\u201cClade B,\u201d \u201cClade C,\u201d and \u201cClade D\u201d) (Figure S6).4 DISCUSSION\nOn the basis of \u201cdataset_70,\u201d our likelihood\u2010mapping analysis confirmed additional tree\u2010like signals over time compared with our previous results.46, 47 This result implies increasing genetic divergence of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 in human hosts (Figure 1A), consistent with the findings of our earlier studies.46, 47 Split network analysis for SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 \u201cdataset_70\u201d using the NeighborNet method was highly unresolved, indicating an explosive, star\u2010like evolution of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102, and recent and rapid human\u2010to\u2010human transmission (Figure 1C). These results are consistent with the ML phylogenetic analyses, which showed polytomy topology from \u201cdataset_70\u201d (Figure 2). However, NJ phylogenetic analyses showed a more bifurcating tree topology compared with the ML phylogenetic analyses (Figure S1). This is a good example showing the differences between NJ and ML phylogenetic construction methods. \u201cDataset_70\u201d had a minor strong positive temporal signal based on root\u2010to\u2010tip regression and ML dating analyses (Figures 3 and S2), with the estimated TMRCA dates and evolutionary rates for SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 found to be nearly identical using both analyses (Table 1). The estimated TMRCA dates and evolutionary rates for SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 were very similar across different clock models and coalescent tree priors using the tip\u2010dating method. The estimated TMRCA dates and evolutionary rates for SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 were also very similar across different clock models using the constrained\u2010dating method, but highly distinct across the different coalescent tree priors (Table 1). The TMRCA estimated by the tip\u2010dating method was relatively narrower than that determined by the constrained\u2010dating method, consistent with our previous studies.46, 47 Bayesian analyses with the tip\u2010dating method using a strict clock as well as constant size coalescent tree prior indicated that SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 is evolving at a rate of 1.24\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u22123 substitutions per site per year (Table 1), in accordance with our prior research46, 47 and similar to that found for other human coronaviruses.41 Our results also suggest that the virus originated on 24 November 2019, which is in further agreement with our earlier studies.46, 47 We identified eight phylogenetic clusters (number of sequences 2 to 7) with posterior probabilities between 0.99 and 1.0 using Bayesian inference (Figure 4). We also identified six transmission clusters (number of sequences 2 to 23) when the genetic distance between the SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 strains was <0.001% substitutions/site (Figure 5). However, our conclusions should be considered preliminary and explained with caution due to the limited number of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 genome sequences presented in this study. As more genome sequences become available, there may be stronger among\u2010lineage rate variation over time as to warrant using a relaxed clock model, but we anticipate that the evolutionary rates and TMRCA dates will be broadly similar to those estimated here. As the number of substitutions is still small, it is tempting to speculate that sequencing errors could have a considerable impact on the evolutionary rate and TMRCA date estimates. We removed three SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 genome sequences (ie, BetaCoV/Wuhan/IPBCAMS\u2010WH\u201002/2019, EPI_ISL_403931; BetaCoV/Shenzhen/SZTH\u2010001/2020, EPI_ISL_406592; BetaCoV/Shenzhen/SZTH\u2010004/2020, EPI_ISL_406595) with potential sequencing errors, but these may have less impact on the above estimates when more substitutions of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 are accumulated over time. We also expect that as more SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 genome sequences become available, the estimated 95% BCIs of the evolutionary rates and TMRCA dates will be narrower.\nWe found that the Pangolin\u2010CoV virus from the two pangolin samples was clustered with the SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 virus with 100% bootstrap support; however, BetaCoV/bat/Yunnan/RaTG13/2013 was more similar to the SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 virus than to the pangolin coronavirus and the human SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 virus (\u201cClade A\u201d) showed a unique peptide (PRRA) insertion not found in the other three clades (\u201cClade B,\u201d \u201cClade C,\u201d \u201cClade D\u201d). This insertion constitutes an RRAR motif in the spike protein at the junction of S1 and S2 junction in the human SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 virus, after considering the next amino acid (R) of the unique peptide (PRRA) (Figure S6). Of note, the highly favored motifs for furin cleavage are Arg\u2010X\u2010(Arg/Lys)\u2010Arg (RXRR or RXKR), and the minimal motifs for furin cleavage can be RXXR.48 We also note that some of the other coronaviruses have a furin motif in almost the same location in their spike proteins.49, 50 Lentiviruses have an RKXR (R, arginine; K, lysine; X, any amino acid) site between gp120 and gp41, cleaved by furin to convert gp160 into subunits.51-54 Therefore, it is tempting to speculate that cleavage or lack of cleavage of the spike protein at this site could significantly impact host range and transmissibility. Taken together, the pangolin coronavirus samples (SRR10168377 and SRR10168378) were less similar to the SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 virus than to the BetaCoV/bat/Yunnan/RaTG13/2013 virus and did not have the RRAR motif. Therefore, we concluded that the human SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 virus, which is responsible for the current outbreak of COVID\u201019, did not come directly from pangolins. However, due to the limited viral metagenomic data obtained from pangolins, we cannot exclude that other pangolins from China may contain coronaviruses that exhibit greater similarity to the SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 virus.\nIn conclusion, our results emphasize the importance of further epidemiological investigations, genomic data surveillance, and experimental studies of the role of the unique furin cleavage motif (RRAR) of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 in the spike protein at the junctions of S1 and S2. Such work could positively impact public health in terms of guiding prevention efforts to reduce SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 transmission in real time, and to stem future outbreaks of zoonotic diseases.ACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThis study was supported by a grant from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 31470268) to Prof. Yi Li.

It belongs to the \u03b2\u2010coronavirus genus of the Coronaviridae family, and has 96% genomic identity with a previously detected SARS\u2010like bat coronavirus.1, 2 The virus subsequently spread and, on 30 January 2020, the World Health Organisation (WHO) declared it a public health emergency of international concern (https://www.who.int/news\u2010room/detail/30\u201001\u20102020\u2010statement\u2010on\u2010the\u2010second\u2010meeting\u2010of\u2010the\u2010international\u2010health\u2010regulations\u2010(2005)\u2010emergency\u2010committee\u2010regarding\u2010the\u2010outbreak\u2010of\u2010novel\u2010coronavirus\u2010(2019\u2010nCoV). On 26 February, the Director\u2010General of the WHO announced that the number of new cases of the disease, now officially known as COVID\u201019, reported outside China since the day before had for the first time exceeded the number of new cases in China (https://www.who.int/dg/speeches/detail/who\u2010director\u2010general\u2010s\u2010opening\u2010remarks\u2010at\u2010the\u2010mission\u2010briefing\u2010on\u2010covid\u201019\u2010\u2010\u201026\u2010february\u20102020). By 13 March 2020, a total of 137\u2009445 cases and 5088 fatalities had been reported in 117 countries (https://gisanddata.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6), giving rise to major concerns throughout the world, but particularly in South Korea, Iran, and Italy.\nFollowing the detection of two imported cases involving Chinese travelers on January 31, the first cluster of 16 Italian cases was reported in the north\u2010Italian region of Lombardy on February 21, after which the number of new notified cases exponentially grew until, by 13 March, it had reached a total of 15\u2009113 cases and 1016 deaths. Other confirmed cases of infection have subsequently been reported in a number of other Italian regions, such as the Veneto, Emilia\u2010Romagna, Piemonte, Liguria, and Marche. Simultaneously, various cases suspected to have been acquired in Italy have been described in a number of other countries.\nWe have now molecularly characterized and phylogenetically analyzed three complete genomes of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 isolated from three of the first 16 patients observed in Italy, none of whom reported a recent history of foreign travel.2 PATIENTS AND METHODS\nAll of the data used in this study were previously anonymized as required by the Italian Data Protection Code (Legislative Decree 196/2003) and the general authorizations issued by the Data Protection Authority. Ethics Committee approval was deemed unnecessary because, under Italian law, it is only required in the case of prospective clinical trials of medical products for clinical use (Art. 6 and Art. 9 of Legislative Decree 211/2003). However, all of the patients gave their written informed consent to the medical procedures/interventions carried out for routine treatment purposes.\nClinical details of patients are described in Supporting Information Material.\nAfter isolating the virus in Vero cells, SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 RNA was extracted from the culture supernatant after 24\u2009hours, and the full genome was obtained by amplifying 26 fragments using previously published specific primers.3 The polymerase chain reaction products were used to prepare a library for Illumina deep sequencing using a Nextera XT DNA Sample Preparation and Index kit (Illumina, San Diego, CA) in accordance with the manufacturer's manual, and sequencing was carried out on a Illumina MiSeq platform using the 2\u2009\u00d7\u2009150 cycle paired\u2010end sequencing protocol. The results were mapped and aligned to the reference genome obtained from GISAID (https://www.gisaid.org/, accession ID: EPI_ISL_412973) using Geneious software, v. 9.1.5 (http://www.geneious.com).4\nThe genomes obtained from the three patients were aligned with a total of 157 SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 genomes obtained worldwide and publicly available at GISAID on 3 March 2020 (https://www.gisaid.org/), and with an additional Italian strain that became available during the study. Table S1 shows the accession IDs, and sampling dates and locations of the sequences included in the dataset.\nA root\u2010to\u2010tip regression analysis was made using TempEst in order to investigate the temporal signal of the dataset.5\nThe Hasegawa\u2010Kishino\u2010Yano model with a proportion of invariant sites (HKY+I) was selected as the simplest evolutionary model by means of JmodelTest, v. 2.1.7,6 and the phylogenetic analysis was made using a Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo method implemented in BEAST, v.1.8.4.7\nTwo coalescent priors (constant population size and exponential growth) and strict vs relaxed molecular clock models were tested by means of path sampling (PS) and stepping stone (SS) sampling.8 The substitution rate prior was set as a normal distribution with mean 2.2\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u22126 substitutions/site/day, standard deviation\u2009=\u20091.1\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u22126 (http://virological.org/t/phylodynamic\u2010analysis\u2010176\u2010genomes\u20106\u2010mar\u20102020/356).9 The time of the most recent common ancestor (tMRCA) was calculated using days as the unit of time.\nAll of the genes were tested for selection pressure using Datamonkey (https://www.datamonkey.org/).3 RESULTS\nRoot\u2010to\u2010tip regression analysis of the temporal signal from the dataset revealed a relatively weak association between genetic distances and sampling days (a correlation coefficient of 0.46 and a coefficient of determination [R2] of 0.21) (Figure 1).\nFigure 1\nOpen in figure viewerPowerPoint\nRoot\u2010to\u2010tip regression analysis of the 161 SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 sequences aligned\nComparison of the marginal likelihoods of the strict vs relaxed molecular clock and constant vs exponential coalescent models showed that the model best fitting the data was the exponential coalescent prior (PS BF exponential growth vs constant\u2009=\u2009968.2; SS BF exponential growth vs constant\u2009=\u2009\u2212967.5) under a log\u2010normal relaxed clock (PS BF strict vs relaxed clock\u2009=\u2009\u22122; SS BF strict vs relaxed clock\u2009=\u2009\u22121.6).\nFigure 2 shows the obtained dated tree: isolates from China were intermixed throughout the tree, mainly in a basal position with respect to the other sequences. The three Italian genomes clustered in a single highly supported clade (clade A, highlighted in Figure 1; posterior probability, pp\u2009=\u20091) that also included two recently characterized genomes from Italy obtained from patients involved in the same outbreak in Lombardy, three isolates from Europe (two from Germany, one from Finland), and two Latin American sequences (one from Mexico and one from Brazil). One of the German isolates (from Bavaria, EPI_ISL_406862) was in the outgroup of the highly supported subclade (pp\u2009=\u20091) including all of the other strains, and the other German sequence shared a highly supported node (pp\u2009=\u20091) with the Mexican sequence.\nFigure 2\nOpen in figure viewerPowerPoint\nDated tree of 161 SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 sequences showing statistically significant support for clades along the branches (posterior probability >0.7).

The table shows the time of the most recent common ancestor (tMRCA) estimates and 95% high posterior density of the significant clade A nodes. SARS\u2010CoV\u20102, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2\nTable in Figure 2 summarizes the estimated mean tMRCAs of the tree root and of the main significant clade. The estimated mean tMRCA of the tree root was 115 days before the present (95% high posterior density [HPD]: 84.3\u2010154.3), corresponding to 11 November 2019 (credibility interval: 31 October\u201012 December). The estimated mean tMRCA of node A was 39.5 days before the present (95% HPD: 35\u201047), corresponding to 25 January 2020 (credibility interval: 18\u201030 January 2020), and the estimated mean tMRCA of node B was 34.4 days before the present (95% HPD: 27\u201042), corresponding to 31 January 2020 (credibility interval: 23 January\u20107 February). Finally, the estimated mean tMRCA of the internal node between the Mexican and the German isolates (node C) was 16.2 days before the present (95% HPD: 8\u201026), corresponding to 18 February 2020 (credibility interval: 8\u201026 February).\nComparison of the genetic distances estimated on the basis of the number of nucleotide substitutions indicated a mean 7.8 nucleotide substitutions between the isolates in clade A (range: 0\u201024 nucleotide substitutions). Three sequences (two Italian and one Brazilian) were identical, whereas one Italian strain had a difference of as many as 18 nucleotides from the German outgroup sequence (EPI_ISL_406862). All of the sequences in clade A showed a D614G mutation in the S gene. No sites were identified as being under significant positive selection pressure.4 DISCUSSION\nThe present phylogenetic analysis confirms that the common origin of the SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 strains characterized so far was several weeks before the first cases of COVID\u201019 pneumonia were described in China.9 It also shows that the whole genomes of the three SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 strains isolated from patients in northern Italy and characterized by us are closely related to each other, as well as to the other two published Italian sequences, and the German, Finnish, Mexican, and Brazilian sequences, all of which formed a highly supported clade.\nThe German sequence at the outgroup of the clade came from a COVID\u201019 outbreak reported between 20 and 24 January and occurring after business meetings with a Shanghai business woman who tested positive after returning to China.10 Our tMRCA estimate showed that the root of clade A was in the month of January 2020, a period compatible with this event. However, our data do not allow us to make any hypotheses concerning the possible routes followed by the virus to reach Italy because, given the limited number of sparsely sampled sequences in the tree,11 it is impossible to infer the directionality of transmission, and this means that multiple independent importations to Europe cannot be excluded.\nOur data suggest that SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 virus entered northern Italy between the second half of January and early February 2020, which is weeks before the first Italian case of COVID\u201019 was identified and therefore long before the current containment measures were taken.\nInterestingly, although they were sampled in the same area on the same day, the genomes isolated from these three patients have a number of different, mainly synonymous substitutions. In particular, one patient living near the municipality in which the highest number of cases was recorded showed a high degree of genomic heterogeneity, thus suggesting considerable genetic drift.\nIn conclusion, our data show that the SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 isolates infecting the Italian patients involved in the early epidemic in northern Italy and those isolated from other European and Latin American patients reporting contacts with Italy, are closely related to the strain isolated during one of the first European clusters observed in Bavaria in late January 2020.12 On the basis of the phylogenetic analysis alone, we cannot exclude possibly multiple introductions in Germany and Italy from China (or other countries), but the epidemiological data showing that the first cases in Germany preceded the first cases in Italy by almost a month suggest that the strain entered Germany before Italy. Finally, as we have characterized only three genomes so far, we cannot exclude the presence of other different strains in Italy that may be the result of multiple introductions. Further epidemiological and molecular studies of a larger sample are needed to clarify these issues.ACKNOWLEDGMENT\nWe acknowledge the authors and the originating and submitting laboratories of the GISAID sequences.CONFLICT OF INTERESTS\nThe authors declare that there are no conflict of interests.AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS\nAL, GZ, and MG conceived and designed the study.

It has since spread rapidly to almost all parts of China and many other countries. As at 3 March 2019, the incidence of COVID\u201019 continues to rise.1\nFor coronaviruses, RNA\u2010dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) is an important enzyme that catalyzes the replication of RNA from RNA templates. Compared the sequence of RdRp in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS\u2010CoV), SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS\u2010CoV), SARS\u2010CoV and SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 have remarkably similar sequences, and encode structurally similar structures of RdRp (Figure 1A,B).2 Moreover, RdRp of the three viruses has a huge and deep groove as an active site for the polymerization of RNA and the variations of residues in SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 and SARS\u2010CoV are distal to the active site2 (Figure 1B). Remdesivir (GS\u20105734) is a 1\u2032\u2010cyano\u2010substituted adenosine nucleotide analog inhibitor of RdRp and shows broad\u2010spectrum antiviral activity against several RNA viruses, including Ebola virus, SARS\u2010CoV, and MERS\u2010CoV.3-5 More importantly, one report indicated that remdesivir improved the critical condition of one COVID\u201019 patient.6 Therefore, RdRp could be an attractive therapeutic target for SARS\u2010CoV\u20102.\nFigure 1\nOpen in figure viewerPowerPoint\n(A) Sequence alignment for the amino acids of RdRp between SARS\u2010CoV\u20102, SARS\u2010CoV, and MERS\u2010CoV.

The active site (Val557) and grid box size (light yellow) were showed for binding site. MERS, Middle East respiratory syndrome; RdRp, RNA\u2010dependent RNA polymerase; SARS\u2010CoV, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus\nIn China, many traditional Chinese medicinal compounds have been used to treat SARS\u2010CoV and SARS\u2010CoV\u20102.3 However, the mechanisms of activity and the efficiency of these compounds remain unclear. Therefore, we screened the chemical structures of clinically used traditional Chinese medicinal compounds with proven antiviral activity against SARS\u2010CoV and their similar chemical structures, using a molecular docking method to target RdRp of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102.2 MATERIALS AND METHODS\n2.1 Structure preparation\nThe three\u2010dimensional (3D) structure of RdRp of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 (NCBI Reference Sequence: YP_009725307.1), SARS\u2010CoV (NCBI Reference Sequence: NP_828869.1), and MERS\u2010CoV (NCBI Reference Sequence: YP_009047223.1) were generated based on homologous modeling using Modeller7 incorporated within the UCSF Chimera8 and SWISS\u2010MODEL.9\n2.2 Compound dataset collection\nEighty\u2010three chemical structures from traditional Chinese medicinal compounds and their similar structures were retrieved from ZINC15 database.\n2.3 Molecular docking and virtual screening\nWe used two molecular docking methods for analysis. First, molecular docking and virtual screening was performed using idock download from Github (https://github.com/HongjianLi/idock) in a local Linux machine. Second, the Blind Docking server was used for in silico prediction of the lowest free binding energy. Calculations were carried out with \u201cAchilles\u201d Blind Docking Server, available at: http://bio\u2010hpc.eu/software/blind\u2010docking\u2010server/. The grid box encompassed by the active site (Val557) and surrounding amino acids around the catalytic pocket of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 RdRp was using for ligand docking and virtual screening (Figure 1B). For each structure, nine docking poses were generated and the scores for the best docking poses of each structure were used for ranking.3 RESULTS\nScreening of these chemical structures revealed that theaflavin (ZINC3978446, Figure 2A) has a lower idock score in the catalytic pocket of RdRp in SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 (\u22129.11\u2009kcal/mol), SARS\u2010CoV (\u22128.03\u2009kcal/mol), and MERS\u2010CoV (\u22128.26\u2009kcal/mol) (Figure 2B). The contact modes between theaflavin and RdRp of these viruses with the lowest idocking scores are illustrated in Figure 2C\u2010E, respectively. Regarding contact modes by idock, hydrophobic interactions contribute significantly in binding and additional hydrogen bonds were found between theaflavin and Asp452, Arg553 and Arg624 of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 RdRp (Figure 2C), and between theaflavin with Thr440, Ser566, Ala569, and Asp644 of SARS\u2010CoV RdRp (Figure 2D), and between theaflavin with Arg294, Thr292, Gln291, Leu427, Asn 390, Leu427, and Asp728 of MERS\u2010CoV RdRp (Figure 2E).\nFigure 2\nOpen in figure viewerPowerPoint\n(A) The structure of theaflavin (ZINC3978446). (B) Red and green molecules, respectively, represent crystallographic and predicted pose for theaflavin. (C\u2010E) The contact model between theaflavin and SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 RdRp (C), SARS\u2010CoV RdRp (D), and MERS\u2010CoV RdRp (E) are shown in two\u2010dimensional (2D) interaction diagram by idock. (F) The contact model between theaflavin and SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 RdRp is shown in the 2D interaction diagram by the Blind Dock server. Their relative distances between amino acid residues and theaflavin are analyzed and illustrated by LigPlot+. Carbon, oxygen, nitrogen, and fluoride molecules are marked as white, red, blue, and green circles, respectively. Covalent bonds in theaflavin and amino acid residues of RdRp are labeled in purple and orange solid lines, respectively. The light blue dot lines label the distance (in \u00c5) of hydrogen bonds formed between the functional moieties of theaflavin and amino acid residues. Hydrophobic interactions between theaflavin and RdRp are depicted by the name of involving amino acid residues, which are labeled with dark green with dark red eyelashes pointing to the involved functional moiety of theaflavin. (G) The hydrogen bonds and \u03c0\u2010cation interaction established by theaflavin with the closest residues are showed through Protein\u2010Ligand Interaction Profiler (PLIP). MERS, Middle East respiratory syndrome; RdRp, RNA\u2010dependent RNA polymerase; SARS\u2010CoV, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus\nBecause theaflavin has the lowest idock score in the catalytic pocket of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 RdRp (\u22129.11\u2009kcal/mol), we used the Blind Docking server to confirm the result. We found that theaflavin has lower binding energy of \u22128.8\u2009kcal/mol when it docks in the catalytic pocket of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 RdRp. The 2D and 3D contact modes between RdRp and theaflavin with the lowest binding energy are illustrated in Figure 2F,G. Regarding the contact modes by the Blind Docking server, hydrophobic interactions contribute significantly for binding. We observed additional hydrogen bonds and \u03c0\u2010cation interaction between theaflavin and SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 RdRp (Figure 2F,G). The contact mode showed that hydrogen bonds were formed between theaflavin and Asp452, Lys545, Arg555, Thr556, Tyr619, Lys621, Cys622, Asp623, Arg624, and Asp760 of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 RdRp, near the active site of RdRp. In addition, one \u03c0\u2010cation interaction was formed between theaflavin and Arg553 (Figure 2F,G).4 DISCUSSION\nMany herbals and compounds used in traditional Chinese medicine have been screened as anti\u2010SARS\u2010CoV therapy.10-14 Theaflavin, a polyphenolic compound in black tea, is thought to be responsible for the medicinal value of black tea. Theaflavin and theaflavin gallate derivatives have shown broad\u2010spectrum antiviral activity against several viruses, including influenza A and B viruses and hepatitis C virus.15, 16\nFurthermore, it has been shown that extracts from Pu'er tea and black tea, and theaflavin\u20103,3\u2032\u2010digallate and 3\u2010isotheaflavin\u20103\u2010gallate, in the theaflavins family, have potent inhibitory activity against SARS, by inhibiting SARS\u2010CoV 3CLpro activity.17 In this study, we found that theaflavin was able to dock in the catalytic pocket near the active site of RdRp in SARS\u2010CoV\u20102, SARS\u2010CoV, and MERS\u2010CoV. Furthermore, theaflavin has the lowest idock score and lower binding energy in the catalytic pocket of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 RdRp in the two different molecular docking methods. We also found that theaflavin formed additional hydrogen bonds and \u03c0\u2010cation interaction with the catalytic pocket of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 RdRp. This may explain why theaflavin had lower idock score than the other chemical structures that we screened. It is possible that theaflavin could inhibit RdRp activity through blocking the active site in the groove.5 CONCLUSION\nOur results suggest that theaflavin could be used as a lead compound for developing a SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 inhibitor that targets RdRp. However, the exact in vivo effect is still unclear, and further research is needed to confirm the mechanism whereby theaflavin target SARS\u2010CoV\u20102.ACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThis study was supported by the Grant CMRPG6H0162 from Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, and MOST 108\u20102320\u2010B\u2010182\u2010021 from the Ministry of Science and Technology to Dr CYW.

Countrywide interventions include delaying the resumption of workplaces, and encouraging citizens to stay and work from home, and so on.\nHowever, these efforts are limited by one hard problem: how to differentiate the COVID\u201019 cases from the healthy. For confirmed COVID\u201019 cases, reported common clinical symptoms include fever, cough, myalgia, or fatigue.8 Yet these symptoms are not unique features of COVID\u201019 because these symptoms are similar to that of other virus\u2010infected diseases such as influenza.9 Currently, virus nucleic acid real\u2010time polymerase chain reaction (RT\u2010PCR), CT imaging, and some hematology parameters are the primary tools for clinical diagnosis of the infection.10 Many laboratory test kits have been developed and used in testing patient specimens for COVID\u201019 by Chinese CDC, US CDC, and other private companies. The virus nucleic acid RT\u2010PCR test has become the current standard diagnostic method for the diagnosis of COVID\u201019. Yet these RT\u2010PCR test kits suffer from many limitations: (1) These tests have long turnaround times and are complicated in operation; they generally take on average over 2 to 3 hours to generate results. (2) The PCR tests require certified laboratories, expensive equipment, and trained technicians to operate. (3) There are some numbers of false negatives for RT\u2010PCR of COVID\u201019.11 These limitations make RT\u2010PCR unsuitable for use in the field for rapid and simple diagnosis and screening of patients. It limits the outbreak containment effort. Therefore, there is an urgent need for a rapid, simple to use, sensitive, and accurate test to quickly identify infected patients of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 to prevent virus transmission and to assure timely treatment of patients.\nTesting of specific antibodies of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 in patient blood is a good choice for rapid, simple, highly sensitive diagnosis of COVID\u201019. It is widely accepted that immunoglobulin M (IgM) provides the first line of defense during viral infections, Before the generation of adaptive, high\u2010affinity IgG responses that are important for long term immunity and immunological memory.12 It was reported that after SARS infection, IgM antibody could be detected in patient blood after 3 to 6 days and IgG could be detected after 8 days.13, 14 Since COVID\u201019 belongs to the same large family of viruses as those that cause the MERS and SARS outbreak, we assume its antibody generation process is similar, and detection of the IgG and IgM antibody against SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 will be an indication of infection. Furthermore, detection of IgM antibodies tends to indicate recent exposure to SARS\u2010CoV\u20102, whereas the detection of COVID\u201019 IgG antibodies indicates virus exposure some time ago. Thus, we believe that the detection of both IgM and IgG could provide information on the virus infection time course. The rapid detection of both IgM and IgG antibodies will add value to the diagnosis and treatment of COVID\u201019 disease.\nBased on these, we developed a point\u2010of\u2010care lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA) test product, which can detect IgM and IgG simultaneously in human blood within 15 minutes. We tested the product in eight hospitals and Chinese CDC agencies to validate its clinical efficacy. The results demonstrated this rapid antibody test has high sensitivity and specificity. It can be used in hospitals, clinics, and testing laboratories. The test can also be effectively deployed in businesses, schools, airports, seaports and train stations, etc., giving it the potential to become a compelling force in the fight against this global threat.2 MATERIALS AND METHODS\n2.1 The materials for the manufacture of IgG\u2010IgM combined antibody test of COVID\u201019\nAnti\u2010human IgG and IgM (LF201001, LF201002) were purchased from Nanjing Lefushidai Inc, COVID\u201019 recombinant antigen (MK201027) was developed and purified at Medomics. The recombinant antigen (MK201027) is receptor binding domain of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 Spike Protein, which is transient transfected in cell culture and purified by protein A affinity chromatography and size\u2010exclusion chromatography. The design of the antigen was based on the published SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 sequence. Several different designs of antigen were tested and optimized. Eventually, MK201027 was picked into the testing product. Bovine serum albumin (BSA), and goat anti\u2010human IgG and IgM antibodies, rabbit IgG, and goat anti\u2010rabbit IgG antibodies were obtained from Sigma\u2010Aldrich. Forty\u2010nanometer gold nanoparticle (AuNP) colloids, NC membrane, and plastic pad were obtained from Shanghai KinBio Inc, the glass fiber conjugate pad was obtained from Whatman. The phosphate\u2010buffered saline (PBS) was purchased from Sigma\u2010Aldrich. Inactivated COVID\u201019\u2010positive and \u2010negative serum samples of patients were supplied by Hunan CDC, China.\n2.2 Preparation of AuNP conjugates\nTo prepare the AuNP conjugate, SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 recombinant protein dissolved in PBS (1\u2009mg/mL) was added to the mixture of 1\u2009mL AuNP colloid (40\u2009nm in diameter, OD\u2009=\u20091) and 0.1\u2009mL of borate buffer (0.1\u2009M, pH 8.5). After incubation for 30\u2009minutes at room temperature, 0.1\u2009mL of 10\u2009mg/mL BSA in PBS was added to the solution to block the AuNP surface. After incubation for 15\u2009minutes at room temperature, the mixture was centrifuged at 10\u2009000\u2009rpm and 4\u00b0C for 20\u2009minutes. The supernatant was discarded, and 1\u2009mL of 1\u2009mg/mL BSA in PBS was added to the AuNP conjugate to be resuspended. The centrifugation and suspension processes were repeated twice, and the final suspension solution was PBS. The AuNP\u2010rabbit IgG conjugates were prepared and purified by the same procedure.\n2.3 Preparation of COVID\u201019 rapid test of IgG\u2010IgM\nThe main body of the test strip consists of five parts, including plastic backing, sample pad, conjugate pad, absorbent pad, and NC membrane. Every component of the strip should be given a pretreatment described as follows: the NC membrane was attached to a plastic backing layer for cutting and handling. The anti\u2010human\u2010IgM, anti\u2010human\u2010IgG and anti\u2010rabbit\u2010IgG were immobilized at test M, G, and control line (C line),respectively. Conjugate pad was sprayed with mixture of AuNP\u2010COVID\u201019 recombinant antigen conjugate and AuNP\u2010rabbit\u2010IgG. Sample pad was pretreated with BSA (3%, w/v) and Tween\u201020 (0.5%, w/v) before use.\n2.4 Testing of COVID\u201019 samples using the LFIA system\n2.4.1 Patient and sample collection\nThe patients were recruited who conform to the diagnostic criteria of a suspected case of COVID\u201019 according to the guidelines of diagnosis and treatment of COVID\u20101915 including typical epidemiological history and clinical characteristics. These samples were collected from various hospitals and CDC testing laboratories (total eight) at six different provinces of China. The tests were conducted at the sites by clinical staff who followed the test procedure described in the product inserts. The respiratory tract specimen, including pharyngeal swab and sputum, was used to confirm COVID\u201019 cases, and the blood, including serum and plasma, was used to test the IgM and IgG antibody.\n2.4.2 Sample testing\nBefore testing, the pouched device was opened immediately before use. When refrigerated blood samples were used for the test, they were warmed to room temperature (15\u00b0C\u201030\u00b0C). During testing, 20\u2009\u03bcL whole blood sample (or 10\u2009\u03bcL of serum/plasma samples) was pipetted into the sample port followed by adding two to three drops (70\u2010100\u2009\u03bcL) of dilution buffer (10\u2009mM PBS buffer) to drive capillary action along the strip. The entire test took about 15\u2009minutes to finish.\n2.4.3 Display of results\nA total of three detection lines are on the stip. The control (C) line appears when the sample has flowed through the cartridge. The presence of anti\u2010SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 IgM and anti\u2010SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 IgG will be indicated by a red/pink test line in the M and G region. If only the control line (C) showed red, the sample is negative. Either M or G line or both lines turning into red indicates the presence of anti\u2010SARS\u2010CoV\u20102\u2010IgM or anti\u2010SARS\u2010CoV\u20102\u2010IgG or both antibodies in the specimen. If the control line does not appear red, the test is invalid, and the test should be repeated with another cartridge.\n2.5 Data analysis\nThe rapid SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 IgG\u2010IgM combined antibody test kits were tested at eight hospitals and Chinese CDC laboratories in different provinces, with a total of 397 clinical positive and 128 clinical negative patient blood samples. The test data was collected and analyzed. The specificity and sensitivity of the rapid test kits were calculated according to the following formulas:3 RESULTS\n3.1 Design and the finished product of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 rapid test of IgG\u2010IgM combined antibody kit\nThe SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 rapid IgG\u2010IgM combined antibody test kit is designed and manufactured by Jiangsu Medomics Medical Technologies, located in Nanjing, China. It is a lateral flow qualitative immunoassay for the rapid determination of the presence or absence of both anti\u2010SARS\u2010CoV\u20102\u2010IgM and anti\u2010SARS\u2010CoV\u20102\u2010IgG in human specimens (whole blood, serum, and plasma). The test kit comes with a test cartridge, sample dilution buffer, and a package insert. The testing cartridge has three detection bands, including a distal control band that appears when the sample has flowed to the end of the testing strip. The presence of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 IgG and IgM antibodies are indicated by a red/purple line in the specific region indicated on the device. The SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 rapid IgG\u2010IgM combined antibody test strip, as shown in Figure 1, has two mouse anti\u2010human monoclonal antibodies (anti\u2010IgG and anti\u2010IgM) stripped on two separated test lines. A surface antigen from SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 which can specifically bind to SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 antibodies (including both IgM and IgG) is conjugated to colloidal gold nanoparticles and sprayed on conjugation pads. The AuNP\u2010rabbit IgG conjugates were also sprayed on conjugation pads for binding to anti\u2010rabbit IgG antibody which is immobilized on the control line (Figure 1A).\nFigure 1\nOpen in figure viewerPowerPoint\nSchematic illustration of rapid SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 IgM\u2010IgG combined antibody test. A, Schematic diagram of the detection device; B, an illustration of different testing results; C, means control line; G, means IgG line; M, means IgM line. IgG, immunoglobulin G; IgM, immunoglobulin M; SARS\u2010CoV\u20102, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2\nWhen testing, 10 to 15\u2009\u03bcL specimen is added into the sample port followed by the addition of sample dilution buffer. The mechanism of the assay is based on the hydration and transport of reagents as they interact with the specimen across the strip via chromatographic lateral flow (Figure 1A). As the specimen flows through the device, anti\u2010SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 IgG and IgM antibodies, if present in the specimen, are bound by the SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 antigen labeled gold colorimetric reagent fixed on the conjugate pad. As the conjugated sample continues to travel up the strip, the anti\u2010 SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 IgM antibodies are bound on the M(IgM) line, and the anti\u2010COVID\u201019 IgG antibodies are bound to the G (IgG) line. If the specimen does not contain SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 antibodies, no labeled complexes bind at the test zone and no lines could be observed. The remaining colloidal gold travels up the nitrocellulose to the control line zone, which captures the excess conjugate demonstrating that the fluid has migrated adequately through the device. A reddish\u2010purple line will appear at the control line zone during the performance of all valid tests whether the sample is positive or negative for SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection. During the test, excess reagent including AuNP\u2010rabbit IgG conjugates migrate passes the control line zone, where the AnNP\u2010rabbit IgG conjugates bind to anti\u2010rabbit IgG to form a red line on the control line. Figure 1B is the illustration of different testing results reading for negative, IgM positive, IgG positive and IgM/IgG both positive situations.\nAs one example to show real testing results, Figure 2 shows a testing result photo for six different test cartridges from six patients which represent several different types of results. In cartridge #13, the photo reading represents detection of both IgM and IgG; in cartridge #14 IgM only in low concentration; in cartridge #15, no IgM and IgG; in cartridge #16 IgG only in low concentration; in cartridge #17 IgG only in high concentration and in cartridge #18, IgM only in high concentration in patient bloods, respectively.\nFigure 2\nOpen in figure viewerPowerPoint\nRepresentative photo for different patient blood testing results.

IgG, immunoglobulin G; IgM, immunoglobulin M\n3.2 The detection sensitivity and specificity of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 IgG\u2010IgM combined antibody kit\nTo test the detection sensitivity and specificity of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 IgG\u2010IgM combined antibody test, blood samples were collected from COVID\u201019 patients from multiple hospitals and Chinese CDC laboratories. The tests were done separately at each site. A total of 525 cases were tested: 397 (positive) clinically confirmed (including PCR test) SARS\u2010CoV\u20102\u2010infected patients and 128 non\u2010SARS\u2010CoV\u20102\u2010infected patients (128 negative). The testing results of vein blood without viral inactivation are summarized in Table 1. Of the 397 blood samples from SARS\u2010CoV\u20102\u2010infected patients, 352 tested positive, resulting in a sensitivity of 88.66%. A total of 12 blood samples from the 128 non\u2010SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection patients tested positive, generating a specificity of 90.63%. It was also found that 64.48% (256 of 397) of positive patients had both IgM and IgG antibodies (Table 1).\nTable 1. The detection sensitivity and specificity of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 IgG\u2010IgM combined antibody reagent\nClinical positive samples Clinical negative samples\nSample quantity 397 128\nIgG&IgM positive 256 1\nIgG positive 24 1\nIgM positive 72 10\nSensitivity 88.66%\nSpecificity 90.63%\nAbbreviations: IgG, immunoglobulin G; IgM, immunoglobulin M; SARS\u2010CoV\u20102, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2.\nFor the test, it is very important to know the data of infection time point from clinical samples which will be helpful to compare the data of single\u2010 or double\u2010positive in Table 1. Due to limited time, we do not have complete detailed information for how long each patient was infected or for how long each patient had symptoms when the blood sample was collected at all the clinical sites. We only had such data from one of the clinical site\u2014Wuhan Red Cross Hospital. As a reference, by analyzing one subset data of 58 patients in Wuhan, it was found that 94.83% of the positive patients had both IgM\u2010 and IgG\u2010positive test lines, and 1.72%, 3.45% had only IgM or only IgG\u2010positive lines, respectively (Table 2). The test time was from day 8 to day 33 after infection symptoms appeared. Further studies and information collection are needed for this.\nTable 2.

However, it is more convenient to collect fingerstick blood outside hospitals and clinics. To achieve a simpler operating process, we tested the performance of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 IgG\u2010IgM combined antibody kit with peripheral blood. Patient fingerstick blood and vein blood and plasma from the same patient were tested. As shown in Table 3, seven COVID\u201019 patients and three healthy volunteers were recruited. We took the blood samples from fingerstick, serum of venous blood, and plasma of venous blood and tested them with the kits. Within the 7 patients, 3 patients have IgM only positive and 4 patients have both IgM and IgG positive. All healthy volunteers tested negative. The results showed that all of the positive and negative test results matched with 100% consistency among the corresponding blood samples. This result demonstrates that the SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 IgG\u2010IgM combined antibody test kit can be used as a point\u2010of\u2010care test (POCT). It can be performed near the bedside with fingerstick blood.\nTable 3.

The sensitivity and specificity of the kit were verified via the lab and clinical practice. This test kit provides a product to meet the urgent need for immunoassay tests in Chinese hospitals for the diagnosis of COVID\u201019.\nTo make the kit suitable for different stages of the disease, we developed an IgG\u2010IgM combined antibody test for COVID\u201019 infection (Figure 1). It was also been confirmed that the detection sensibility was higher in IgG\u2010IgM combined antibody test than in individual IgG or IgM antibody test (Table 1). Therefore, we more recommend the development of IgG\u2010IgM combined antibody test kits than the separate IgG or IgM antibody test kits, if there is a reliable technical system available. It is a better test for screening COVID\u201019 patients.\nThis newly developed test kit, the IgG\u2010IgM combined antibody test kit, has a sensitivity of 88.66% and specificity of 90.63%. However, there were still false positive and false\u2010negative results (Table 1). The reasons for the false\u2010negative maybe, first, due to the low antibody concentrations. When IgM and IgG levels are below the detection limit (not determined yet) of this rapid test, the test results will be negative. Second, the difference in individual immune response antibody production could be one reason for the false\u2010negative results in COVID\u201019 patients. The last but not least, IgM antibody will decrease and disappear after 2 weeks. In some cases, it is hard to know exactly when the patient was infected or how long the patient was infected. Thus, when the patient was tested, the IgM level might well be below its peak and not detectable by this test. Therefore, we encourage more research and development of the COVID\u201019 IgG\u2010IgM combined antibody test kit to improve the diagnostic sensitivity and specificity for patients. Since COVID\u201019 recombinant antigen was used in the test, our test is specific for COVID\u201019 infection. The clinical testing data in this paper at different clinical sites from east, south, west, and middle of China confirmed the specificity of the test kit. However, because of the emergency of the outbreak of COVID\u201019, we could not carry out normal research activities and perform enough tests to verify if there is interference from other IgM and IgG induced by different virus infections such as typical flu viruses. This study need to be done later.\nThis new rapid SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 IgG\u2010IgM combined antibody test kit has several advantages. Compared to RT\u2010PCR, it saves time and it does not require equipment, it is simple to perform and only requires minimal training. It can be performed at the bedside, in any clinic or laboratory, at airports or at railway stations.16 It will be more convenient to use fingerstick blood or heel blood instead of vein blood for out\u2010of\u2010clinic screening. Our initial test results using fingertip blood were as good as that of vein blood (Table 3), which suggests that the SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 IgG\u2010IgM combined antibody test kits can be developed as agents for rapid field detection. Another potential application of this test is screening asymptomatic SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 carriers, it was reported that asymptomatic carriers could spread SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 virus.17, 18 This finding made the current COVID\u201019 outbreak control more difficult, because there is no method available to screen asymptomatic carriers. This rapid IgM\u2010IgG combined antibody test kit makes large\u2010scale screening of asymptomatic carriers possible. At least some if not all of the carriers are likely to have anti\u2010SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 antibodies, as demonstrated by asymptomatic Zika virus carriers.19 Because this test can detect IgM and IgG simultaneously, it could be used for both early diagnosis (IgM) and for monitoring during treatment. SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection starts at the lungs, not in the upper respiratory tract,8 therefore, sampling during the early infection stage using throat swab or sputum may not detect the virus. This is one possible explanation for high false negatives in the nucleic acid PCR test. However, this sampling effect should not have any effect on IgM and IgG detection with this rapid test.\nBased on our knowledge and information, there are several other Chinese IVD companies developing or have developed similar products ranging from IgM only and IgM\u2010IgG combined tests. We do not know the details about their technical performance since there is no publication on them. We believe the good test products will be used in clinical sites and the information will emerge. We will carry out comparison studies later.\nCertainly, this test cannot confirm virus presence, only provide evidence of recent infection, but it provides important immunological evidence for physicians to make the correct diagnosis along with other tests and to start treatment of patients. In addition, possible cross\u2010reactivity with other coronaviruses and flu viruses were not studied, and the change level of antibody was not compared in the different stages of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection. We believe the combination of nucleic acid RT\u2010PCR and the IgM\u2010IgG antibody test can provide more accurate SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection diagnosis.5 CONCLUSION\nWe developed a rapid SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 IgG\u2010IgM combined antibody test using lateral flow immune assay techniques. It takes less than 15 minutes to generate results and determine whether there is a recent SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection. It is easy to use, and no additional equipment is required. Results from this study demonstrated that this test is sensitive and specific. This rapid test has great potential benefits for the fast screening of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infections, and it has already generated tremendous interest and increased clinical uses after a short time testing in Chinese hospitals.ACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThe authors would like to thank the technical staff of the Department of State Key Laboratory of Respiratory Disease for excellent assistance.

The virus was tentatively named 2019\u2010nCoV but officially named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS\u2010CoV\u20102) later by the Coronavirus Study Group of the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses, and the disease caused by this virus was name COVID\u201019 by the World Health Organization.2, 3 Up to March 8 (24:00 GMT), 80\u2009735 confirmed cases, have been diagnosed in Mainland China, causing 3119 deaths.4 Cases have also been reported from 101 countries or areas including Thailand, Japan, Korea, Australia, France, and the United States.5 Family clustering of infection, 3000 cases of healthcare personnel infection, and other evidence together have provided strong supporting evidence for human\u2010to\u2010human transmission of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection with a basic reproduction number (R0) of 2\u20104.6-8 SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 has a high transmissibility and can have a long incubation time before manifesting symptoms including fever, coughing, shortness of breath, and diarrhea. SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection can be symptom\u2010free in some patients, but may cause multiple organ failures in lung, heart, and liver in some other patients. The mortality rate of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection is about 3%.1, 9, 10\nThe Yongzhen Zhang team in China was the first group to determine the full\u2010length genomic sequence of the SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 virus.11 The genome is arranged in the order of a 5\u2032\u2010untranslated region (UTR)\u2010replicase complex (orf 1ab)\u2010structural proteins (Spike(S)\u2010Envelope(E)\u2010Membrane (M)\u2010Nucleocapsid (N))\u22123\u2032\u2010UTR and nonstructural open\u2010reading frames (ORFs). Before the emergence of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102, six human coronaviruses including \u03b1 coronaviruses 229E and NL63, \u03b2 coronavirus OC43 and HKU1, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERSr\u2010CoV) and SARS\u2010associated coronavirus (SARSr\u2010CoV) had been identified. Among them, MERSr\u2010CoV and SARSr\u2010CoV can be transmitted from human to human, and were highly pathogenic resulting in high mortality.12-14\nSo far, scientists from different countries have obtained and uploaded more than 100 full\u2010length or partial genomic sequences for SARS\u2010CoV\u20102. Some companies have developed rapid nucleic acid detection kits based on these sequences. However, significant differences in the sensitivity and specificity among these kits have been found from clinical application of these kits. In addition, a standardized quantitative detection method is still lacking. Missed diagnosis and misdiagnosis are currently not uncommon due to these reasons.15-17\nTo provide template sequence for proper design of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) primers and probes to minimize false negative results, and to obtain reliable sequence information for molecular and immunological studies on and vaccine development for SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 virus, we retrieved from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) and GISAID websites, full\u2010length sequences from different regions of the world, established the reference sequence for SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 by homology and phylogenetic tree analyses, analyzed mutations at different locations, and conducted preliminary bioinformatics analyses for the reference sequence.2 MATERIALS AND METHODS\n2.1 Sources and selection of sequences\nThe NCBI (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/) and GISAID (https://www.gisaid.org/) databases up to 14 Feb, 2020 were searched by using keywords \u201cnovel, coronavirus, complete, Wuhan\u201d or \u201c2019\u2010nCoV.\u201d The inclusion criteria included the length of the full\u2010length sequence, which was 25000 to 32000 bp, and was verified to be human SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 sequence. Repetitively submitted sequences and sequences with too many undetermined nucleotides were excluded from this study. Sequences were classified as stage 1 and 2 based on the time sequences retrieved. Sequences obtained on Feb 6, 2020 went into stage 1, while sequences retrieved from Feb 6 to 14 were classified as stage 2 (Figure 1 and Table S1).\nFigure 1\nOpen in figure viewerPowerPoint\nFlow chart of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS\u2010COV\u20102) sequence data collection\n2.2 Establishment of reference sequence\nHomology analysis and sequence alignment were conducted for all stage 1 sequences by using Primer 7.0 and Mega (7.0.14). The reference sequence was conducted by selecting the most common nucleotide in each position. The reliability of the reference sequence was confirmed by comparing it with stage 2 sequences.\n2.3 Phylogenetic analysis\nThe ClustalW program of the MEGA software (7.0.14) was used to conduct multiple sequence alignment and the phylogenetic tree was constructed by using a maximum likelihood approach based on stage 1 sequences. Related coronaviral sequences were used as references (229E(KY369908), NL63(MK334046), OC43(MG197709), HKU1(KT779555), MERSr\u2010CoV(KJ813439), SARSr\u2010CoV(AY278488), bat coronavirus(MN996532)).\n2.4 Analyses of nucleotide and amino acid sequence variation\nPrimer 7.0 was used to compare the reference nucleotide sequence to those of related human isolates and analyze the variation at different locations. Sequence comparison and variation analysis were also conducted at the amino acid level.\n2.5 Analysis of published primer sequences\nSequences of PCR primers/probes from published articles were aligned with our reference sequence to analyze sequence variation. Whether these primer/probe sequences overlapped with variation sites was also examined.3 RESULTS\n3.1 Information about sequences included\nA total of 145 sequences were obtained from databases. These sequences were examined and 50 sequences were excluded from the study according to predetermined criteria. As a result, 95 sequences, among which 63 were obtained from stage 1 and 32 from stage 2, were used for analyses (Figure 1). These sequences were reported from China, America, Australia, Thailand, the United Kingdom, Germany, France, Finland, Korea, Japan, and Singapore, etc (Table S1).\n3.2 Establishment of reference sequence\nThe reference sequence was constructed by nucleotide sequence alignment (accession number: EPI_ISL_412026). The reference sequence composed of 29\u2009870 nucleotides and 9744 amino acids. The length and start and end locations of individual encoding regions are shown in Table 1.\nTable 1.

While different types of coronaviruses showed scattered distribution, all SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 strains clustered together tightly. Importantly, the reference sequence was located in the middle of the SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 cluster, demonstrating good representativeness of the reference sequence constructed (Figure S1).\n3.4 Homology analyses\nComparison of the reference sequence with those of respective isolates showed that the overall homology among full\u2010length genomic sequences was 99.99% (99.91%\u2010100%), and 15 (15.79%) clinical isolates were identical to the reference strain. With respect to individual encoding regions, the homology in open\u2010reading frame (ORF) 1a was 99.99% (99.88%\u2010100%); the homology among the majority of other regions was 100%; no variation was found in E, 6, and 7b regions. At the amino acid level, the homology among full\u2010length sequences was 99.99% (99.79%\u2010100%), with homology among most isolates in each region being 100% (Table 1).\n3.5 Variation analyses at the nucleotide and amino acids levels\nSequence alignment found that mutations at both nucleotide and amino acid levels were relatively rare. However, mutations did exist. Mutations which occurred in \u22653 strains were found in these locations: 1a (nt2662,8782,11083), 1b (nt17373,18060), S (nt21707,24034), 3a (nt26144), M (nt26729), 8 (nt28077,28144), N (nt28854,29095). Strikingly, position 8:nt28144 showed the highest mutation rate of 30.53% (29/95), where T was replaced with C. Similarly, position 1a:nt8782 had a mutation rate of 29.47% (28/95), where C was replaced mostly by T. At the amino acid level, mutations which occurred in \u22653 strains were found in these locations: 1a (aa3606), S (aa49,860), 3a (aa251), 8 (aa62,84), N (aa194) (Table 2, Figures 2 and 3, and Table S2). In addition, six deletion mutations were found in five isolated strains. These mutations resulted in four different truncations in amino acid sequence (1/3/6/8 aa). Furthermore, two deletion mutations were found in the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 nonencoding regions, respectively (Table S3).\nTable 2.

In a newly published article,7 there are site differences between the primers from ORF1b and the reference sequence. In another publication,16 the primer pair and probe sequences were derived from the N region, and also have site differences from the reference sequence. Apparently, these published primer pairs/probes are not likely to work well with the majority of viral isolates.\nTable 3.

An enveloped virus with a diameter of 60 to 140\u2009nm, SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 is round or oval\u2010shaped with some polymorphism.3 The genomic characteristics of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 virus are significantly different from those of MERs\u2010CoV or SARs\u2010CoV. This study showed that its homology with the Bat coronavirus isolate RaTG13 strain (MN996532) was 96%, but has no more than 80% homology with other isolates of bat SARS\u2010like coronavirus (Table S4), which is similar to the results from other studies.18 Recent studies have shown that the homology with a coronavirus strain isolated from pangolin was 99%, suggesting that SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 might have originated from bat and pangolin might have served as the intermediate host between bat and human.19, 20 However, further research is needed to confirm these assumptions.\nThe study on genomic variation of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 is very important for investigation of pathogenesis, disease course, prevention, and treatment of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection. Establishment of the reference sequence for this virus is a fundamental work which will facilitate viral detection, functional analysis, vaccine design, epidemic investigation, evaluation of drug efficacy, among others.\nBased on more than 3000 hepatitis B virus (HBV) sequences reported from different countries, our team has divided HBV isolates into 31 different HBV subtypes established by selecting nucleotide with the highest frequency in each position. Using infectious plasmids constructed based on A2, B2, C2, and D1 subtype\u2010specific reference sequences, in vitro and in vivo studies have confirmed complete biological functions of these reference sequences.21, 22\nUsing the same approaches, in this study, the reference sequence for SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 was constructed based on genomic sequence of 63 isolated strains. The genome size of the reference strain was 29870\u2009bp. The reference sequence was identical to the genomic sequence of 15 strains (15.79%) isolated from clinical samples, suggesting the reference strain would display full biological functions and pathogenicity. Since the sequences retrieved later (Feb 7\u201014) showed high homology with the reference sequence (>99.9%), there was no need to adjust the reference sequence.\nAs a typical RNA virus, the evolution rate of coronavirus could be 10\u22124 substitute per bp per year, and mutation could occur during each replication cycle.12 However, phylogenetic analysis and sequence alignment showed that the homology among different isolates was extremely high. Compared to the reference sequence, the homology of the vast majority of isolates was above 99.99% at both the nucleotide and amino acid levels. In fact, the homology in most encoding regions was 100%. The lowest homology was found in strain EPI_ISL_406592 from Shenzhen, China (99.91%, nt) and strain EPI_ISL_408485 from Beijing, China (99.79%, aa). Overall, results from our analyses suggest that the virus in this epidemic might originate from the same animal species, and caused widespread infection in a short period of time.2, 23\nAlthough sequence variation among SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 isolates was low, and sequence analysis showed a rather random distribution of mutations, we did find mutation hot spots in this study. Nucleic acid detection is currently the gold standard method for diagnosis of COVID\u201019. However, the sensitivity of this method is not high in clinical application.24 Sampling could be one of the reasons accounting for the low sensitivity, the reagents used for detection could be another critical reason. In this study, sequence from 95 strains were examined and 12 locations where mutations occurred in \u22653 strains were found. Importantly, among these locations, mutations were found at nt8782 of ORF 1a, nt28144 of ORF 8, and nt29095 of N region in 28, 29, and 11 strains, respectively. Therefore, data from this study showed that, while designing PCR primers and probes, sequences in these locations should be avoided, and attention must be paid to locations listed in Table S2 and S3 to avoid false negative results. Furthermore, some published primer/probe sequences were compared to the reference sequence established and differences were found. This might partially explain why false negative results in nucleic acid detection of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 for diagnosis of COVID\u201019 is currently not uncommon. Sequence variation information obtained and SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 reference sequence established in this study can provide reliable guidance for the design of primers/probes with maximal sensitivity for detection of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 nucleic acid.\nSARS\u2010CoV\u20102 encodes four important viral proteins including S, E, M, and N proteins.2 This study shows that SARS\u2010COV\u20102 is relatively conserved, especially in the E, 6, 7b regions where no mutation was found. Hotspot mutations in ORFs 1a, S, 8, and the N region will cause changes in the amino acid sequences of these proteins, and the effects of these mutations on viral replication, transmission and the induced immune responses need to be further investigated. The significance of these variations is unclear, and may be directed mutations adapted to the environment.\nA potential shortcoming of this study is that, since all sequences used in this study were retrieved from databases, the accuracy of sequences could not be verified. Although the sequence included in this study is still small, it basically includes most of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 complete viral sequences that have been published worldwide and is widely distributed, which should be able to represent the characteristics of the virus.\nIn summary, in this study SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 genomic sequences that are available from the NCBI and GISAID databases so far were analyzed and the reference sequence for this virus was established. The variations in individual coding regions at both the nucleotide and amino acid level were further analyzed and part of the reasons why the sensitivity of current nucleic acid detection methods is far from ideal was revealed. Establishment of the reference sequence for SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 could benefit not only biological study of this virus but also diagnosis, clinical monitoring and intervention of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection in the future.ACKNOWLEDGMENT\nThe authors are very grateful to Mr. Kaiyang Wu for editing software for nucleotide sequence homology comparison and alignment.

People in some countries have been encouraged to make masks by themselves at home to guard against SARS\u2010CoV\u20102, but it remains unclear whether these homemade masks are effective to block the virus. Moreover, many people have been confused about the claims of some politicians and scientists that medical masks are not useful to protect humans from the infection of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102.\nIn this study, we evaluated the efficacy of three types of masks in blocking avian influenza virus (AIV) in aerosols and the efficacy of instant hand wiping in removing AIV from hands. AIV was used to mock SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 because they are both enveloped and pleomorphic spherical viruses with a diameter of around 80 to 120\u2009nm. We also reviewed previous reports regarding the efficacy of masks.8-15 With these data, we propose a simple approach to slow the spread of the pandemic coronavirus.2 MATERIALS AND METHODS\nLow pathogenic AIV A/chicken/Qingdao/211/2019 was isolated from Qingdao live bird market in 2019. The virus was propagated using embryonated eggs. Virus quantification was performed using a real\u2010time TaqMan reverse transcription\u2010polymerase chain reaction (RT\u2010PCR) assay reported previously.16\nThe efficacy of instant hand wiping in removing AIV from hands was evaluated using a towel soaked in water containing soap powder or sodium hypochlorite.\nType 403 nebulizer (Yuyue Medical Equipment & Supply Company, Jiangsu, China) was used to produce aerosols. The aerosols have the median diameters 3.9\u2009\u03bcm, and 65% of the aerosols have the diameters less than 5.0\u2009\u03bcm, as given in the specification of the nebulizer. The top parts of 60\u2010mL syringes were removed and then wrapped with the tested masks, namely one\u2010layer polyester cloth, a homemade mask made of one\u2010layer polyester cloth plus four\u2010layer kitchen paper (Hengan Company, Fujian, China; each layer contains three thin layers), a medical mask (AMMEX Company, Shanghai, China), and an N95 mask (Type: New 2001, Jiande Chaomei Daily Chemical Company, Zhejiang, China), respectively (Figure 1). QVS facial cleaning sponge (8\u2010mm thick; Watsons Company, Guangdong, China) made of hydrophilic polyvinyl alcohol was set inside the syringe behind the mask (Figure 1) for collecting the virus passing through the masks. The four syringes were then aligned and bound seamlessly together.\nFigure 1\nOpen in figure viewerPowerPoint\nThe system mocking human breath for evaluation of the efficacy of masks3 RESULTS\n3.1 Virus quantification using real\u2010time RT\u2010PCR\nIn principle, if the virus amount declines by 50%, the Ct value of the real\u2010time TaqMan RT\u2010PCR shall increase by 1. Our experiment with three repeats showed that the virus amount declined by 50%, the Ct value increased by 0.96 (95% confidence interval: 0.86\u20101.04), using 1:8 serially diluted allantoic fluid of inoculated embryonated eggs containing the AIV. Taken together, we presumed that the virus amount declines by 50% if the Ct value increases by 1, and the virus amount declines by (100\u2009\u00d7\u2009(1\u2009\u2212\u20091/(2^Y)))% if the Ct value increases by Y, in this study.\n3.2 Efficacy of hand wiping\nWe put 5\u2009\u03bcL of the undiluted allantoic fluid containing the AIV on the hand of one author of this study, and spread the fluid around the palm, and kept for 3\u2009minutes. We then wiped the palm three times from the root of the palm to the tips of the fingers, using a towel soaked in water containing soap or sodium hypochlorite and then wrung to remove most of the water inside. We eluted the hand using 5\u2009mL phosphate\u2010buffered saline (PBS), and RNA from 200\u2009\u03bcL of the eluted PBS was extracted for the detection of the amount of the virus using the TaqMan RT\u2010PCR. Each treatment and the control without wiping were conducted independently for three times. Table 1 showed, as compared with the control without the towel wiping, the virus on the palm declined by 98.36%, 96.62%, and 99.98% through wiping using the wet towel soaked in water containing 1.00% (g/g) soap powder, 0.05% (g/g) active chlorine from sodium hypochlorite, or 0.25% (g/g) active chlorine from sodium hypochlorite, respectively. All the relevant Ct values in Table 1 were of significant difference (P\u2009<\u2009.01) by the t test, except those two pertaining to 1.00% soap powder and 0.05% active chlorine.\nTable 1.

The fluid was added into the nebulizer for producing the aerosols containing the virus. The aerosols were collected using a seamless plastic bag (Figure 1). The nebulizer was paused when the bag was bulging. The air containing the aerosols was inhaled into and out of the syringes for 100 times through the synchronous piston movement of the four syringes, to mock human breath. Then the mask was unwrapped, and the sponge inside the syringe was taken out and added with 2\u2009mL PBS. The sponge was pressed for five times using a 200\u2010\u03bcL pipette tip. RNA from 1\u2009mL of the PBS was extracted for the detection of the amount of the virus using the TaqMan RT\u2010PCR. Each treatment was conducted independently for four times. Table 2 showed that, as compared with the polyester cloth, the N95 mask blocked 99.98% of the virus, and the medical mask blocked 97.14% of the virus, and the homemade mask blocked 95.15% of the virus. All the relevant Ct values were of significant difference (P\u2009<\u2009.01) by the t test, except those two pertaining to the medical masks and the homemade masks.\nTable 2.

In this sense, it is important to have one item at hand, such as 75% alcohol, hand sanitizer gel, disinfecting wipes, for instant hand hygiene after we have touched something possibly contaminated by the virus. This is more important for those traveling long\u2010distance using public vehicles or having touched some items frequently touched by other people. This study suggested that instant hand wiping using a wet towel containing soap or sodium hypochlorite removed most viruses from hands. Water containing 1.00% soap powder is not only helpful for wiping away the virus using its surfactant activity but also efficiently inactivates enveloped viruses including coronavirus, as proved by multiple previous studies.17-19 Moreover, water containing 1.00% soap powder is safe for skin and other items including clothes. It is worth noting that the concentration of soap powder and sodium hypochlorite is vital for their wiping and virucidal effects.\nVarious studies have suggested that SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 can be transmitted through droplets and aerosols,1-7 and so hand hygiene is inadequate to prevent infection of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102, and blocking masks are needed. This study showed that N95 masks blocked nearly all the mock virus, and medical masks blocked approximately 97% of the virus, and the homemade mask blocked approximately 95% of the virus. Therefore, the medical masks are not fully protective in hospitals but are useful for common social occasions. When medical masks are in shortage, the homemade masks made of four\u2010layer kitchen paper (each layer contains three thin layers) and one layer of polyester cloth should be helpful, as indicated by this study. The kitchen paper is effective in blocking the virus possibly because of its multiple layers, nonwoven structure, and virus\u2010absorbing property. As we have tested by ourselves, the tested homemade masks are more breathable than the N95 masks. One advantage of the homemade mask is that the kitchen paper can be changed frequently. It is worth noting that the homemade masks shall be of less blocking efficacy if made of fewer layers of kitchen paper. Other types of homemade masks, especially those made of cloth alone, may be unable to block the virus and thus confer no protection against the virus.20, 21 Additionally, although a person inhales much more than 100 times a day, the mocking data are reliable because aerosols containing the virus to be inhaled by a person on most common social occasions are fewer than in this experiment.\nSome randomized controlled trials (RCTs) did not support the efficacy of medical masks because medical masks could not reduce infection rates of some viral respiratory diseases.14, 15 Consequently, people in some countries opposed to using medical masks on common social occasions. In effect, the conclusions of these RCTs could be erroneous, as reflected by the following assumed scenario. Supposed the virus could have ten opportunities to infect a human during a period of 30 days, wearing medical masks could block three of the 10 opportunities and thus reduce the infection risk by 30%, although it itself could not block the other seven opportunities during the 30 days. Therefore, the fact that medical mask\u2010wearing did not reduce the infection rate could suggest that medical mask\u2010wearing is inadequate to prevent the infection, rather than useless for reducing the infection risk. Some other RCTs and many nonrandomized studies regarding the use of medical masks supported the notion that wearing medical masks could reduce infection risks of some viral respiratory diseases.8-14 Moreover, medical mask\u2010wearing can enhance one's vigilance, prevent direct hand\u2010mouth or hand\u2010nose contact, and reduce air contamination of pathogens from infected people.\nWith the above data and discussion, we propose herein the approach of mask\u2010wearing and instant hand hygiene (MIH), namely that common people should wear effective masks and bring an appropriate item for instant hand hygiene when needed, to slow the rapid spread of the virus worldwide. This is crucial for the world to reduce severe and fatal cases of the virus before successful marketing of the effective vaccines against the coronavirus, and avoid the tragedy of medical systems being overwhelmed by a surge of too many patients. As indicated in this study, when medical masks and disinfectants are in shortage, the homemade masks made of kitchen paper can be used to temporally surrogate medical masks, and so soap powder is used for instant hand hygiene.\nFrom the news we know that the MIH approach has been implemented in China, Republic of Korea, and Japan, where mask\u2010wearing is widely accepted and items for instant hand hygiene are usually accessible in public areas. The spread of the coronavirus in all these three countries has been well controlled.3, 6 In contrast, Iran, Italy, Spain, and the USA did not implement the MIH approach in the beginning weeks, and many people in those countries are reluctant to wear medical masks. None of these four countries have decelerated the spread of the coronavirus so far.3, 5ACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nWe thank Meng Yang and Randong Li for their helpful advice and assistance.

Random mutations in pathogens sculpted by natural selection empower them to attain increased virulence and mechanisms to evade host immune response. The recent pandemic of COVID\u201019 is yet another manifestation of the might of natural selection.1 SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 is the seventh strain of coronavirus and fourth of beta coronavirus, so far known to infect humans. Before SARS\u2010CoV\u20102, two strains of coronavirus, namely SARS\u2010CoV and MERS\u2010CoV have caused outbreaks of relatively limited scale.2 SARS infection epidemic, dubbed as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), during 2002\u20102003, spread across 37 countries affecting nearly 8500 individuals with 916 deaths.3 In comparison, by January 2020, MERS\u2010CoV infected 2519 individuals of 27 countries with 866 deaths.4 The recent outbreak of COVID\u201019, now categorized as a pandemic, is by all means considerably widespread compared with earlier coronavirus outbreaks. By 29 March 2020, the infection has its presence around the globe with over half a million of the world population being infected and has claimed over 30\u2009000 lives and counting.5\nSARS\u2010CoV and SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 spike proteins interact with human angiotensin\u2010converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as their receptor, whereas MERS\u2010CoV spike protein attaches with dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4).6, 7 Recently, several structures of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 spike protein complexed with human ACE2 have been resolved (PDBids: 6LZG, 6VW1, 6M17), highlighting the critical residues involved in the intermolecular interactions between the viral spike protein and its receptor.7 As the virus has been transmitted in humans from bats and/or other intermediate hosts, considerable work has been conducted to explore the sequence and structural variations in the spike proteins and animal host ACE2 receptors.8-10 It has been shown that variations in both viral spike protein and host ACE2 sequences may act as a barrier for viral infection across species.2, 8, 9 This, in turn, raises two interesting possibilities: first, do the natural genetic polymorphism in human ACE2 gene and/or protein influence their attachment with SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 spike protein? Second, are these genetic variants of ACE2 benign or could it be considered as an evolutionary trade\u2010off where a variation in a trait may bring both advantage and disadvantage to the fitness of an organism? This study aims to explore both these possibilities by a battery of sequence and structure analysis tools. The findings provide interesting insights into the potential relationship between natural genetic variants in human ACE2 and susceptibility and/or resistance against COVID\u201019 infection.2 METHODOLOGY\n2.1 Data mining for structure and genetic polymorphism\nProtein sequences of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 spike protein (YP_009724390.1) and human ACE2 (Q9BYF1) were retrieved from NCBI and UniProt, respectively. Structures of both the proteins were identified by PDB\u2010BLAST and retrieved from RCSB protein data bank.11 Data for genetic variants and allele frequencies were obtained from Ensembl Genome Browser12 and gnomAD.13 Appropriate filters were employed to limit the data to only the coding region variants of ACE2 gene. Coding variants of ACE2 corresponding to the critical binding sites between ACE2\u2010SARS\u2010CoV14 and ACE2\u2010SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 (PDBid: 6LZG), and those reported to show impaired binding with coronavirus spike protein in the in vitro mutation analysis15 were selected for further investigations (Table S1).\n2.2 Impact analysis of allelic variants\nThe effect of amino acid substitution on protein (ACE2) stability was predicted at 25\u00b0C and 37\u00b0C using I\u2010Mutant2.0.16 The program predicts the change in the free energy (\u0394\u0394G) in the sequence variants compared with the wild type. An increase or decrease in protein stability is indicated by negative or positive \u0394\u0394G values, respectively. The functional impact of all selected allelic variants of ACE2 was predicted using sorting intolerant from tolerant (SIFT),17 PolyPhen\u20102,18 combined annotation\u2010dependent depletion (CADD)19 and rare exome variant ensemble learner (REVEL).20\n2.3 Protein molecular modeling\nA total of 17 ACE2 coding region allelic variants were identified that correspond to the critical interaction points between ACE2 and receptor\u2010binding domain (RBD) of coronavirus spike protein. Structural models of these variants were generated using atomic coordinates of PDBid: 2AJFA (wild\u2010type ACE2) as a template by Modeller9.16.21 The models were optimized for Gibb's free energy and loop conformation. Each model was then individually superimposed over the template and root mean square deviation (RMSD) in the C\u03b1 backbone was estimated in \u00c5 using SWISS\u2010PdBViewer 4.1.0.22 In addition, variations in the spatial orientation of the key residues and corresponding change in the intramolecular hydrogen bonds were also noted by DS visualizer 2016.\n2.4 Structure analysis of ACE2 variants and SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 spike protein complexes\nVery recently, several cocrystal structures of human ACE2 complexed with SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 spike protein, (PDBids: 6LZG, 6VW1, 6M17), have been resolved via X\u2010ray diffraction and cryoelectron microscopy. In this study, 6LZG was chosen because of the nonchimeric nature of the spike protein and resolution at a lower wavelength (2.5\u2009\u00c5) for the generation of docking poses by superimposition. Docking poses were developed by C\u03b1 backbone superimposition of each ACE2 variant model over PDBid: 6LZG using SWISS\u2010PdBViewer 4.1.0.22 Intermolecular hydrogen bonds, electrostatic, and hydrophobic interactions between SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 spike protein and human ACE2 variants were monitored using DS visualizer 2016. PRODIGY web server was used to predict binding affinity and different types of intermolecular interactions: charged\u2010charged, charged\u2010polar, charged\u2010apolar, polar\u2010polar, polar\u2010apolar, and apolar\u2010apolar of the complexes.233 RESULTS\nSARS\u2010CoV\u20102 spike glycoprotein is a 1273 amino\u2010acid\u2010long structural protein located on the outer envelope of the virus. The protein has two main functional subunits: a long N\u2010terminal S1 subunit and a relatively short C\u2010terminal S2 subunit. A 200 amino\u2010acid\u2010long RBD is stationed within the S1 subunit of the spike protein that is mainly involved in its interaction with ACE2 receptor.6, 7, 10 Human ACE2 is an 805 amino\u2010acid\u2010long protein with two functional domains: N\u2010terminal peptidase M2 domain and C\u2010terminal collectrin domain. Partial structure of the ACE2 has been resolved (PDBid: 1R42) comprising peptidase M2 domain. Structurally, the peptidase domain has two catalytic subdomains with an active site sandwiched in between the two subdomains.24 Cocrystal structures of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 spike protein complexed with human ACE2 (PDBid: 6LZG), SARS\u2010CoV with human ACE2,14 and in vitro mutation analysis of human ACE215 have identified the critical residues that underpin the interaction between the RBD of viral spike protein and ACE2 peptidase domain. In this study, among the 345 and 242 natural ACE2 coding variants identified from Ensembl Genome Browser and gnomAD, respectively, 17 were found at positions that have shown to be important for the binding of ACE2 with the viral spike protein (Table S1). Allele frequencies of these variants range from 5.45E\u22126 (rs1299103394) to 3.88E\u22123 (rs4646116). To predict the potential pathological consequences rendered by ACE2 alleles, changes in the free energy of ACE2 variants were estimated. The results showed that amino acid substitutions in only three alleles rs73635825 (S19P), rs1299103394 (K26E), and rs766996587 (M82I) may adversely affect the stability of the encoded protein compared with the wild type (Table 1). However, to date, no pathogenic consequences have been reported in relation to these variants in humans. Moreover, except for rs73635825 (S19P), which was predicted to be damaging by only PolyPhen\u20102, different prediction tools designed to assess the functional impact of the mutations and/or single\u2010nucleotide polymorphisms did not reveal any ensuing pathogenicity rendered by these variants (Table 1). Conversely, rs961360700 (D355N) and rs762890235 (P389H) were predicted to be detrimental by SIFT and Polyphen\u20102, whereas rs1396769231 (M383T) was predicted to be damaging by SIFT, Polyphen\u20102, and REVEL prediction tools. Nevertheless, no report of any functional impact was found in the literature for these allelic variants of ACE2 as well.\nTable 1.

Structurally, all ACE2 variants bear the characteristic two subdomains of peptidase M2 domain with active site cleft present in between. The overall protein architecture of ACE2 allelic variants is largely conserved with RMSD of C\u03b1 backbone that varies from 0.17 to 0.58\u2009\u00c5, compared with the wild type (Table 1 and Figure 1A,B). Like SARS\u2010CoV, RBD of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 spike protein comprises two subdomains: core and extended loop. Cocrystal structures of SARS\u2010CoV and SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 spike proteins complexed with ACE2 have demonstrated that the extended loop of RBD directly interacts with loops flanked by \u03b12 and \u03b13 helices and a \u03b2 hairpin loop between \u03b23 and \u03b24 sheets of ACE2.7, 14 The additional residues of ACE2 reported to affect its binding with the viral spike protein by mutation analysis15 lies at C\u2010terminal to these regions. Though the C\u03b1 backbone of ACE2 allelic variants was found to be highly conserved, the spatial orientation of substituting residues varied noticeably compared with the wild type (Figure 1C,D). Therefore, it is possible that these variations in the orientation of amino acid side chain may, in turn, alter the intramolecular interactions in different allelic variants. This consequently may affect the orientation of other critical amino acids of ACE2, otherwise not substituted in the respective variants, but required for the interaction with SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 spike protein.\nFigure 1\nOpen in figure viewerPowerPoint\nStructure of angiotensin\u2010converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) allelic variants.

D, Enlarged view of the boxed region (C), amino acid changes with corresponding single\u2010nucleotide polymorphism ids are labeled at respective positions\nTo compare the binding of different ACE2 allelic variants with SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 spike protein, docking poses were generated by the superimposition of structures of ACE2 variants over ACE2\u2010SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 complex structure (PDBid: 6LZG). All ACE2 variants were found to bind with the viral spike protein with topology nearly identical to the resolved ACE2\u2010SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 complex structure (PDBid: 6LZG) (Figure 2A). This is not surprising, as no major structural change was observed in the protein backbone of different ACE2 variants (Figure 1A,B). By and large, the nature and number of intermolecular contacts between SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 spike protein and humans ACE2 variants were found to be comparable (Figure 2B). However, some important variations were observed, for example, compared with a total of 70 interactions found in SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 spike protein and wild\u2010type ACE2 complex, 60 and 81 intermolecular interactions were observed between SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 spike protein and rs143936283 (E329G) and rs961360700 (D355N) variants of ACE2, respectively. Among the six compared types of interactions, the three most strongest, charged\u2010charged, charged\u2010polar, and charged\u2010apolar were found nearly identical between rs961360700 (D355N) and SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 spike protein compared with the wild\u2010type ACE2 and SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 spike protein complex. In comparison, ACE2 variant, rs143936283 (E329G) showed less charged\u2010charged, charged\u2010polar, charged\u2010apolar, polar\u2010apolar, and apolar\u2010apolar interactions with SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 spike protein. This implies that rs143936283 (E329G) in humans may confer some level of resistance against the attachment of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 to the receptor molecule. However, accounting for the dynamic nature of protein\u2010protein interaction, it is difficult to draw a fair conclusion from simply these observations. Therefore, inter\u2010residual interaction maps were developed for complexes between each ACE2 allelic variant and SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 spike protein.\nFigure 2\nOpen in figure viewerPowerPoint\nInteraction between angiotensin\u2010converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) allelic variants and SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 spike protein.

Briefly, the most conserved intermolecular interactions (hydrogen bonds) between different ACE2 variants and SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 spike protein were found between Y41, H34, Y83, and K353 of ACE2 and T500, Y453 (except M82I), N487 (except T27A and D427Y), and G502 (except S19P and E329G) of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 spike protein, respectively. Similarly, hydrophobic interactions between K31 and K353 of ACE2 and Y489 and Y505 of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 spike protein, respectively, were also found to be conserved in complexes of all ACE2 variants with the viral spike protein. This implies that none of these ACE2 allelic variants offer complete resistance against the attachment of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102. However, some important variations are noteworthy to mention here. For example, Q42 of wild\u2010type ACE2 interacts with G446 and Q449 of the SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 spike protein, but all ACE2 alleles\u2010spike protein complexes did not show any such interaction. The Q42 of ACE2 also interacts with Y449 of the spike protein and this interaction is also absent in ACE2 alleles corresponding to T27A, E35D, E37K, M82I, E329G, and M383T amino acid substitutions. A similar observation was made for the interaction between E35 of ACE2 and Q493 of the SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 spike protein (Figure 2D and Supporting Information Figures). This may suggest that ability of E35 and Q42 to interact with SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 spike protein could be affected by its spatial positioning in ACE2 protein which may get affected by the change in the intramolecular interaction and/or electrostatic potential due to the substitution in the flanking residues with respect to the three\u2010dimensional conformation of ACE2. Conversely, K353 of ACE2 establishes hydrogen bond interactions with G496 and G502 of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 spike protein. Both these interactions were found to be absent in only the S19P (rs73635825) variant of ACE2. Moreover, the binding affinity of the S19P ACE2 variant for SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 spike protein was also predicted to be lowest (\u221210.3) among all the alleles including the wild\u2010type ACE2. Similarly, E329G ACE2 variant which was predicted to have the second\u2010lowest binding affinity (\u221210.8) for SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 spike protein also lacked K353\u2010G502 interaction in the respective complex. It is important to note here that K353 is one of the key residues of ACE2 that not only showed interaction with the spike proteins of both SARS\u2010CoV14 and SARS\u2010CoV\u20102, but also its substitution in in vitro mutation analysis which has been shown to completely abolish the interaction between ACE2 and coronavirus spike protein.15 Therefore it is likely that rs73635825 (S19P) and rs143936283 (E329G) alleles of ACE2 may offer some level of resistance against the SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 attachment with the human ACE2 receptor.4 DISCUSSION\nACE2 gene encodes a zinc metalloprotease which acts as a receptor molecule for three strains of coronavirus, SARS\u2010CoV, NL63, and recently SARS\u2010CoV\u20102. Several studies have explained the variations in the coronavirus spike protein and host ACE2 receptor to predict and/or prove the origin and potential of cross\u2010transmission of the virus.1, 7-9 However, less attention has been given to explore the effect of natural genetic and expressional variants of human ACE2 for the potential susceptibility and/or resistance against the coronavirus infection. In vitro assays have shown that expression of ACE2 is positively correlated with the SARS\u2010CoV infection.25 Similarly, genetic variants in ACE2 have been proposed to affect the interaction of the receptor with the viral spike protein.15 Conversely, a recent preliminary study predicts no such link between the human ACE2 variants and coronavirus infection.26 The present study focuses to explore the variation in the binding of the protein encoded by ACE2 coding variants with SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 spike protein.\nMany coding variants of ACE2 in humans have been associated with cardiovascular disorders, hypertension, and diabetes.27, 28 Although some variants of ACE2, assessed in the present investigation, were predicted to have some functional impact but to date, no empirical data show their link with any disease or genetic disorder in humans. Moreover, compared with the wild type, no significant change has been observed in the overall structural conformation of the ACE2 protein variants and the substituted amino acids which are located on one of the subdomains of peptidase M2, distant to the catalytic sites of ACE2.24 Thereby, it is plausible to suggest that these variants of ACE2 may be under neutral selection. Protein molecular modeling and related bioinformatics tool could provide significant insights to predict the potential variations in the protein structures and complexes.29 In the present study, a comparative modeling and molecular superimposition revealed important variations in the intermolecular interaction between ACE2 alleles and SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 spike protein. It is interesting to note that for two ACE2 alleles, rs73635825 (S19P) and rs143936283 (E329G), low binding affinity and lack of some of the key residues in the complex formation with SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 spike protein could be suggestive of intrinsic resistance to some scale against the SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection. Therefore, it is conceivable that under new selection pressure as offered by SARS\u2010CoV\u20102, these alleles may undergo positive selection. However, as protein\u2010ligand and protein\u2010protein interactions are dynamic,30 therefore the implementation of molecular dynamic simulation could further validate the absence of some of the critical interactions between these ACE2 alleles and SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 spike protein. Consistently, empirical means of deducing binding affinity of intermolecular complexes could also provide important insights in this regard.31\nWhere mutations in viruses enable them to cross species barrier and/or become more virulent, natural genetic variants in host receptors may concomitantly offer susceptibility/resistance against evolving pathogenic viruses. For example, genetic variations in CD4 receptor (C868T) and CCR5\u2010\u039432 in humans confer susceptibility and resistance, respectively, against certain HIV strains.32, 33 The present investigation highlights candidate alleles of ACE2 that may lead to the variation in the susceptibility and/or resistance against COVID\u201019. Moreover, it provides a template for similar investigations in relation to the recently reported molecule, TMPRSS2, required for priming the spike protein for cellular entry of the virus.34 Finally, clinical manifestations and recovery rate of COVID\u201019 varies significantly between different age groups, nationalities, and race.4, 5, 35 It is possible that in some individuals, if not all, the positive prognosis of the COVID\u201019 may be due to the existence of ACE2 variants like rs73635825 (S19P) and rs143936283 (E329G). Therefore, the findings of this investigation provide clues to screen frequencies of the candidate alleles in different populations to predict the prognosis of COVID\u201019.", "25779": "As of 15 March 2020, 81\u2009059 cases were diagnosed totally in China, including 10\u2009817 patients receiving treatments and 3226 severe cases. Currently, there are no effective antiviral medications or vaccines available.1 However, many clinical trials about coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID\u201019) are undergoing to find effective treatment in China, which has not been reported.\nOn 15 March 2020, we used \u201cnovel coronavirus\u201d or \u201ccoronavirus disease 2019\u201d or \u201cCOVID\u201019\u201d in Chinese language to search in the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry database without time limitation (http://www.chictr.org.cn/index.aspx). We analyzed these records according to the date, geographical distribution, the objective of study, study type and design, and sample size to reveal the current situation of the clinical trials about COVID\u201019 in China.\n434 registered clinical trials about COVID\u201019 were enrolled. The first record was from Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital on Jan 23, where has been the core battlefield to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS\u2010CoV\u20102) in the early stage. It was a randomized, open\u2010label, blank\u2010controlled trial for the efficacy and safety of lopinavir\u2010ritonavir and interferon\u2010alpha 2b in hospitalization patients with COVID\u201019. Two thirds of the total records occurred from Feb 12 to Mar 3 with a mean speed of (12\u2009\u00b1\u20094) records per day (Figure 1A). The number of the registered records trended to decrease since 4 March. A total of 130, 49, 37, and 35 records located in Hubei, Guangdong, Shanghai, and Sichuan, respectively, turning to be the top four provinces (Figure 1B). Furthermore, the top five cities belonged to Wuhan, Shanghai, Beijing, Chengdu, and Guangzhou with the records of 117, 37, 32, 31, and 29, respectively.\nFigure 1\nOpen in figure viewerPowerPoint\nA, Distribution of the 434 clinical trials about COVID\u201019 according to the date and (B) geographical distribution. C, The epidemic trend of COVID\u201019 in China. COVID\u201019, coronavirus disease 2019\nWe unfolded the objectives of trials according to cell therapy (19 records), biological therapy (34 records), western medicine (71 records), Chinese medicine (99 records), and others (211 records). Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) were the most popular seed cells with 14 records followed by NK cells and mononuclear cells with 3 and 2 records, respectively. As for the biological therapy, 16 clinical trials focused on anti\u2010cytokine storm occurring in severe patients, like recombinant interferons recommended by the National Health Commission of China, anti\u2010tumor necrosis factor\u2010\u03b1, anti\u2010interleukin\u20106, and anti\u2010GM\u2010CSF. Seven clinical trials were going to evaluate the efficacy and safety of anti\u2010SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 inactivated convalescent plasma in the treatment of patients with COVID\u201019. Of the 71 records related to the western medicine, remdesivir captured the public's attention very much.2 The other antiviral medications involved phosphoric chloroquine (23 records) and lopinavir\u2010ritonavir (17 records), which were also clinically used in the treatment now. Many kinds of Chinese traditional medicine or methods were under evaluation. The others were mainly about mental health of the patients, doctors, nurses, college students, the public, and the other kinds of diagnosis methods, like the lung ultrasound. None of specific vaccines are in the clinical trial stage.\nAs for the study type, 221 of the 434 records belonged to the interventional research. 121 clinical trials were observational studies. 18 trials aimed to the diagnostic tests. Researchers were exploring several kinds of diagnostic methods including new high\u2010throughout detection of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 nucleic acid (4 records), plasma immunoglobulin M/immunoglobulin G detecting (3 records), chest computed tomography imaging (3 records), lung ultrasound (2 records), sputum or throat swab sample collecting (2 records), screening of peripheral blood biomarkers (2 records), screening of microRNAs as early diagnostic markers of COVID\u201019 viral infection (1 record), and magnetic resonance imaging for myocardial damage diagnosis (1 record). The top four kinds of study design were parallel, sequential design, non\u2010randomized control, and single arm with the number of 168, 110, 31, and 27 records, respectively. The sum of the samples of all clinical trials about COVID\u201019 was 254,635. However, despite 202,842 objects without COVID\u201019 themselves, 51\u2009793 patients with COVID\u201019 will be enrolled into the related 327 clinical trials.\nWe also used \u201c2019\u2010nCoV\u201d or \u201cSARS\u2010CoV\u20102\u201d or \u201cnovel coronavirus\u201d or \u201ccoronavirus disease 2019\u201d or \u201cCOVID\u201019\u201d in English language to search in the clinicalTrials.gov. 94 records were obtained, and most of them are the same as those registered in the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry database. 16 records were from out of China mainland, namely France (5 records), United States (3 records, namely 2 for remdesivir, and 1 for Vaccine\u2010mRNA\u20101273), South Korea (3 records, namely 2 for remdesivir and 1 for lopinavir/ritonavir), Hong Kong (2 records), Thailand (1 record), and Italy (1 record).\nThe Chinese doctors and researchers showed great power to respond to an urgent health problem by setting 434 clinical trials in 52 days. However, a strict designed protocol is a guarantee for the believable result, especially for the parallel randomized trials. Of the 221 interventional trials, only 19 trials (8.5%) have a good designed protocol according to the standard protocol items: recommendations for interventional trials.3 Compared with the trials set outside of China mainland, another problem is that 55.1% of the 434 trials did not claim to use the right data management system including a paper case record form and an electronic data capture. Meanwhile, a big concern occurs that is 10\u2009817 patients are receiving treatments in hospital and only few new cases are diagnosed nowadays (Figure 1C), while 51\u2009793 patients with COVID\u201019 are needed in the trials. Further analysis showed that 209 trials were recruiting, 201 trials were not yet recruiting, 13 trials were suspended because of lack of patients and only 11 were completed. None of the completed trials belonged to interventional study. The possible solution is to integrate the similar trials and meanwhile, select some trials of top priority. Considering to the pathogenic mechanism of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102,4, 5 we deemed carefully that the anti\u2010SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 inactivated convalescent plasma, MSCs transplantation,6 remdesivir, and tocilizumab7 are the most four promising alternatives currently in the treatment of the patients with COVID\u201019, especially for the severe and critically severe types. Furthermore, we have primarily demonstrated that transplantation of ACE2\u2010 MSCs improves the outcome of patients with COVID\u201019 pneumonia by revering the lymphocyte patten and regulate the cytokine storm.6FUNDING INFORMATION\nThis study was supported by the Postdoctoral Science Foundation of the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, National Natural Science Foundation of China (81972523) and the National Key Research and Development Program of China (2016YFA0101000, 2018YFE0114200).", "25817": "1 INTRODUCTION\nCoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID\u201019), which was first reported in Wuhan, Hubei province, China, has caused over 80\u2009422 human infections and more than 2984 deaths (as of 4 March 2020) in China.1, 2 The confirmed cases outside China are increasing, which raised major global concern. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS\u2010CoV\u20102) was identified to be the pathogen of COVID\u201019. SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 has joined SARS\u2010CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome\u2010related coronavirus (MERS\u2010CoV) as another coronavirus that causes severe respiratory disease and human death.3, 4\nThe specificity of the interaction between virus and receptor determines its host range for the virus. Spike protein (S) of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 has attracted great attention because of its role in receptor binding. Angiotensin\u2010converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) binds to the receptor\u2010binding domain (RBD) of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 S protein and functions as a receptor for SARS\u2010CoV\u20102.5, 6 The origin of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 is considered as bat.6 However, the intermediate host is unknown. Some studies suggest that pangolin is involved in the evolution of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102.7, 8 Others suggested that snake and turtles are potential intermediate hosts for SARS\u2010CoV\u20102.9, 10 In this study, we compared the key amino acids (AAs) in ACE2 from different species for the binding ability to RBD. On the basis of potential interaction between S protein and ACE2, it was speculated that SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 preserved the ability to infect Bovidae and Cricetidae but not snake or turtle.2 METHODS\n2.1 Sequence analysis of ACE2\nA total of 93 ACE2 protein sequences were selected from 85 mammals, 4 birds, 3 turtles, and 1 snake.

On the basis of known 20 key sites in human ACE2 interacting with SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 RBD,11 we analyzed whether these sites were conserved on other ACE2 proteins. Phylogenetic and molecular evolutionary analysis of ACE2 protein was conducted using molecular evolutionary genetics analysis version X (MEGA\u2010X).12 Phylogenetic tree was generated with Jones\u2010Taylor\u2010Thornton evolutionary model using a maximum\u2010likelihood method.\n2.2 Structure simulation of ACE2\u2010RBD complex\nOn the basis of the structure of hACE2 with SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 S RBD (PDB: 6LZG), the structure of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 S and ACE2 from Bos taurus, Cricetulus griseus, Pelodiscus sinensis, and Ophiophagus hannah were simulated by SWISS\u2010MODEL online server13 and analyzed by Chimera software version 1.14.143 RESULTS\n3.1 Sequence alignment of ACE2\nAccording to the recently resolved structure of the complex of human ACE2 and SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 RBD, there are 20 key AAs in hACE2 for interacting with RBM.11 We analyzed those AAs of ACE2 protein from a list of mammals, birds, turtles, and snake, as shown in Table 1. Next, a phylogenetic tree for mammalian ACE2 proteins was constructed by MEGA\u2010X software. There were 16 primates ACE2, 5 Bovidae ACE2, 2 Cricetidae ACE2, and 3 Cetacea ACE2 (Table 1 and Figure 1A), possessing at least 90% (18/20) critical AAs. Pangolin ACE2 preserved only 70% (14/20) AAs. Nearly half of the key residues in turtles (CpbACE2, CmACE2, and PsACE2) and snake (OhACE2) were changed (Table 1). ACE2 from Aves, including Gallus gallus, Anas platyrhynchos, Meleagris gallopavo, and Cathartes aura, only matched 10 to 11 AAs (Table 1).\nTable 1.

To investigate whether Bovidae/Cricetidae ACE2 maintained the binding affinity with SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 RBD, we simulated the potential structure of the protein complex. T82 and E30 in Bos taurus ACE2 kept the contact to F486 and K417 in SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 S (Figure 1B). N82 and Q34 in Cricetulus griseus ACE2 maintained the contact to F486 and Y453 in SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 S (Figure 1C). We concluded that Bovidae/Cricetidae ACE2 could associate with SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 S (Figure 1B,C).\nTo investigate the potential association between SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 and ACE2 from turtle and snake, we simulated the potential structure of turtle/snake ACE2 with SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 RBD. The AA correlated to hACE2 Q42 is changed to A (A41) in turtle (Figure 1D). We also noticed that the AA correlated to hACE2 H34 is changed to A (A60) in a snake (Figure 1E). When the contact AA was mutated to smaller AA (A), the contact force for protein\u2010protein interaction will be reduced. Moreover, the corresponding AA of K31 was changed to E (E30) in turtle and Q (Q57) in snake ACE2 (Figure 1D). K31 in hACE2 was critical for SARS\u2010CoV RBD binding and ACE2\u2010K31D mutant abolished its association with SARS\u2010CoV RBD.15 Taken together, turtle and snake ACE2 are unlikely to bind to S protein of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102.4 DISCUSSION\nSARS\u2010CoV, MERS\u2010CoV, and SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 have caused severe human infectious diseases in the last 2 decades. These three human coronaviruses originated from bats, but the intermediate hosts were different. SARS\u2010CoV came from the Paguma larvata,16 and the intermediate host for MERS\u2010CoV is Camelus dromedaries.17 The new coronavirus SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 has recently caused a serious pandemic in China and other countries. However, it is not clear which animals are involved in the evolution of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 and which animals may be infected by SARS\u2010CoV\u20102. RBD region in S protein of pangolin coronavirus is similar to that of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102,7, 8 indicating the involvement of pangolin in the recombination of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102. By analyzing the codon usage of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102, people suggested that snake might be a potential host for SARS\u2010CoV\u20102.9 Another study indicated that turtle is a potential intermediate host for SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 based on the key AAs in ACE2 for interacting with SARS\u2010CoV RBD.10 The late study raised the concerns of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection in the turtle aquaculture and pet turtle. Most of the coronaviruses hosts are mammals; with a few of exceptions are birds. Considering that all known hosts for coronaviruses are thermostatic animals, it is unlikely that reptiles will be infected with SARS\u2010CoV\u20102.\nThere are 20 key AAs in ACE2 critical for binding S protein of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102.11 On the basis of these 20 AAs, we analyzed the corresponding AAs in ACE2 from a list of mammal, bird, turtle, and snake. We found that the ACE2 of turtles and snake lost the capability to associate with S protein (Table 1 and Figure 1D,E). These reptiles should be ruled out from the potential host list for SARS\u2010CoV\u20102. Aves ACE2 was unlikely to associate with SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 RBD because they lost the critical K corresponding to K31 in human ACE2 (Table 1). Pangolin ACE2 was predicted to recognize SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 RBD less efficiently because it only preserved 14 of 20 critical AAs (Table 1). Interestingly, we found that ACE2 proteins from Primates, Bovidae, Cricetidae, and Cetacea were capable to recognize RBD of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 by maintaining the majority of key residues in ACE2 for associating with SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 RBD. Swine ACE2 (CpACE2) with 15 of 20 matched critical AAs was shown to support SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 entry.6 Bovidae/Cricetidae ACE2 matched more AAs than swine ACE2, thus they should recognize SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 RBD. It would strengthen our conclusion if we have biochemical evidence for the S\u2010ACE2 interaction analysis for Bovidae/Cricetidae ACE2. On the basis of human ACE2 and SARS\u2010CoV\u2010spike complex structure model (PDB ID: 2AJF), we and others recently predicted that hamster ACE2 could associate with SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 and hamster might be a candidate small animal model for SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection.18, 19 Indeed, golden Syrian hamster (Mesocricetus auratus) has been established as a model to study the pathogenesis and transmission of COVID\u201019.19 One of Cetacea, Neophocaena asiaeorientalis asiaeorientalis (Yangtze finless porpoise), lives in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River and its lakes, where Wuhan located nearby.20 It will be interesting to investigate whether Yangtze finless porpoise could be infected with SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 or related coronavirus.\nIn conclusion, we found that Bovidae/Cricetidae ACE2 but not turtle/snake ACE2 could recognize SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 RBD. More attention should be paid to Bovidae and Cricetidae in hunting the potential intermediate host for SARS\u2010CoV\u20102.ACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThe authors would like to thank Dr Shan Gao for the discussion.

At an interval of 2 to 3 days, tear and conjunctival secretions were collected twice with disposable sampling swabs for reverse\u2010transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT\u2010PCR) assay.Results\nTwenty\u2010one common\u2010type and nine severe\u2010type NCP patients were enrolled. Two samples of tear and conjunctival secretions were obtained from the only one patient with conjunctivitis yielded positive RT\u2010PCR results. Fifty\u2010eight samples from other patents were all negative.Conclusion\nWe speculate that SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 may be detected in the tears and conjunctival secretions in NCP patients with conjunctivitis.1 INTRODUCTION\nIn December 2019, 41 cases of unexplained pneumonia were clustered in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China. Most of the infected people were confirmed to be related to the South China Seafood Market. On 7 January 2020, the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention isolated and confirmed this pathogen as a novel type of coronavirus through a throat swab. This coronavirus was then named 2019\u2010nCoV by the World Health Organization (WHO).1 The origin of the virus remains unknown, and the virus\u2010host is suspected to be a species of bat.2 On 25 January 2020, the WHO confirmed that the virus was spread via human\u2010to\u2010human transmission and family\u2010aggregated infections and is less contagious to healthcare professionals, unlike severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS\u2010CoV) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome\u2010related coronavirus.3 On 31 January 2020, the WHO characterized the outbreak as a public health emergency of international concern.4 At the close of day (on 18 February 2020 at 24:00:00), the cumulative number of infected people worldwide was 73\u2009332, and the cumulative number of infected people in China was 72\u2009528. The virus had spread to 25 other countries globally, with 1873 deaths worldwide.5 At present, the mortality rate in China is about 2.58%, and the number of infected and dead people continues to increase. On 11 February 2020, the WHO officially named infection due to the virus as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID\u201019)5 and the Coronavirus Study Group of the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses named 2019\u2010nCoV severe acute respiratory syndrome\u2010related coronavirus 2, or SARS\u2010CoV\u20102.6 At present, COVID\u201019 poses a huge threat to China and the world. COVID\u201019 is highly infectious and transmitted mainly through respiratory droplets and contact with infected persons. The possibility of feco\u2010oral and aerosol transmission remains to be further studied.7 In 2004, some researchers found that the tears of SARS patients tested positive for viral nucleic acid, some patients only showed positive results with tear samples,8 and the chromosome of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 was 82% similar to that of SARS\u2010CoV.9 A previous study reported the case of a clinician who was infected while working with only his eyes unprotected.10 Lu et al11 reported that the disease can be transmitted through the mucous membranes, including the conjunctiva. There have been many case reports in which many ophthalmologists were found to be infected through routine diagnosis and treatment.11 Considering that the virus is present in the body fluids of patients, tear fluid is a type of body fluid, and SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 is similar to SARS\u2010CoV, it is speculated that there may be a risk of tear and conjunctival transmission. Therefore, this is a focus of the current research to understand whether COVID\u201019 is transmitted via other routes and reduce further spread of the epidemic.\nIn the present study, the tear and conjunctival secretions of patients diagnosed with the novel coronavirus were collected for viral culture and reverse\u2010transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT\u2010PCR) assay, attempting to elucidate the presence of novel coronaviruses in tears and conjunctival secretions of SARS\u2013CoV\u20102\u2010infected patients, and provide evidence for further understanding the transmission route of this disease.2 METHODS\nA prospective interventional case series study was designed. We included cases of confirmed novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP) patients at the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University from January 26, 2020 to February 9, 2020. The diagnostic criteria were (a) real\u2010time RT\u2010PCR assay of respiratory or blood specimens yielded positive results for the novel coronavirus nucleic acid and (b) computerized tomography lung imaging findings were consistent with viral pneumonia. The common\u2010type diagnostic criteria were the diagnosed patients exclude the severe\u2010type criteria. The severe\u2010type diagnostic criteria were (a) respiratory distress (respiratory rate, \u226530 cycles per minute), (b) oxygen saturation 93% or below or arterial partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2)/oxygen concentration FiO2 lesser than or equal to 300\u2009mm Hg in the resting state, (c) respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation, (d) shock, and (e) other forms of organ failure requiring monitoring and treatment at the intensive care unit.12\nThe study protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee of the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine, and all the included patients provided written informed consent themselves in advance.\nWe used the conjunctival swab technique (Figure 1) to collect tears and conjunctival secretions from patients. We opened the lower eyelid of each patient and used a disposable sampling swab to wipe the conjunctiva of the lower eyelid fornix of the patient's eyes without anesthesia. Then, we placed one side of the head of the sampling swab into the sample preservation solution of the disposable virus sample tube, broke off the end of the swab along the red scale, and closed the cap of the virus sampling tube. Each specimen was stored in a 4\u00b0C refrigerator and then sent to the laboratory of the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University. RT\u2010PCR assays were performed at the State Key Laboratory for Diagnosis and Treatment of Infectious Diseases. To avoid cross\u2010infection, gloves were changed after collecting each sample. At the time of collection of each sample, the patient's current temperature was recorded and a sputum sample obtained, and the sputum sample was also sent to the laboratory for examination. Two samples were taken from each patient, at intervals of 2 to 3 days. Before collecting the first sample, we recorded the time of onset of symptoms and how and when the antiviral drug was used for each patient.\nFigure 1\nOpen in figure viewerPowerPoint\nConjunctival swab technique used to collect tears and conjunctival secretions.

We pipetted 1 to 2\u2009mL of the specimen and stored it in an Eppendorf tube.\n2.\nThe tube was then centrifuged at 12\u2009000\u2009r/min for 5 minutes and 300\u2009\u00b5L of the supernatant was pipetted and added to the prepared deep well plate. Then, we added 20\u2009\u00b5L of proteinase K and 6\u2009\u00b5L of settling agent to extract the nucleic acid. The extraction was completed after about 22\u2009minutes. Then, the nucleic acid was stored in a new Eppendorf tube.\n3.\nWe prepared eight\u2010strip PCR tubes, added 20\u2009\u00b5L of the mixed reaction solution (2019 Novel Coronavirus Nucleic Acid Detection Kit; Shanghai Berger Medical Technology Co Ltd), added 5\u2009\u00b5L of the extracted nucleic acid, covered it, and ran the PCR reaction using the Roche LightCycler\u00ae 480 (Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Mannheim, Germany). After instantaneous centrifugation for 40 cycles, the PCR was completed in about 85 minutes; thereafter, we checked the amplification curves to judge whether the results were negative or positive.3 RESULTS\nAltogether, 21 patients with common\u2010type and 9 patients with severe\u2010type were included, with an average age of 54.50\u2009\u00b1\u200914.17 years and a male/female ratio of 7/3. By the time of first collection of tear and conjunctival secretions, the mean time of onset was 7.33\u2009\u00b1\u20093.82 days. The average body temperature of the patients was 37.09\u00b0C\u2009\u00b1\u20090.69\u00b0C at the time of sampling.

Fifty\u2010eight conjunctival swab samples from 20 common\u2010type patients and 9 severe\u2010type patients were all negative.4 DISCUSSION\nCurrently, it is difficult to screen for NCP. Some patients have no obvious fever or respiratory manifestations, or even obvious symptoms in the early stages of the disease.13 During clinical diagnosis and treatment, particularly at the outpatient clinic, it is difficult to quickly screen patients with early\u2010stage disease or carriers of the virus. According to recent reports, a large number of ophthalmologists involved in the diagnosis and treatment of the disease on a daily basis accidentally acquired NCP. Thus, many doctors suspect that it is related to contact with tears or conjunctival secretions of patients.11 In the study of this small sample, we used conjunctival test paper to obtain tears and conjunctival secretions of 30 patients for standard RT\u2010PCR assay. Only one patient with conjunctivitis found viral RNA in his tear fluid and conjunctival secretion twice. The conjunctivitis was characterized by viral conjunctivitis with conjunctival congestion and aqueous secretion. The patient had no severe fever or respiratory symptoms when we collected his specimens. And the course of disease was in the early stage for only 3 days.\nNo viral RNA was detected in the tear fluid and conjunctival secretions of the severe or common\u2010type patients without conjunctivitis. While taking the tear fluid sample for testing, we obtained sputum samples from patients as control samples; 55 of the 60 sputum samples yielded positive results. This, to some extent, indicated that the tear and conjunctival secretions of patients without conjunctivitis were not an infectious route for SARS\u2010CoV\u20102. At present, the transmission route of the novel coronavirus remains unclear, and many scholars believe that it may be transmitted through aerosols.14 However, the most commonly used noncontact tonometer for ophthalmologic examination sprays a gas during the examination, which produces a large amount of aerosol in the local area. Moreover, aerosols may be concentrated in the local air for a long time, and general alcohol wipe disinfection is ineffective, causing great panic in the field of ophthalmology.15 According to the results of this study, no virus particles were detected in tear and conjunctival secretions in patients without conjunctivitis. Therefore, current routine disinfection can prevent the spread of the virus; noncontact tonometer, ultrasound biomicroscopy, corneal confocal microscope, and others do not theoretically cause cross\u2010infection. The low abundance of the virus in tear and conjunctival secretions does not eliminate the risk of transmission through conjunctival tissue. As ophthalmologists come into contact with patients at a close\u2010range during the examination, the saliva of infected patients may still cause infection among medical staff through conjunctival tissue; thus, goggles are still necessary protective measures.\nRT\u2010PCR is an effective technique for detecting viral nucleic acid.16, 17 Due to its high sensitivity and specificity, this method has the advantages of simplicity, convenience, and efficiency. Some scholars have found that RT\u2010PCR is effective for diagnosing novel coronavirus through meta\u2010analysis, is significantly better than smear\u2010dyeing inspection and culture identification, and it has become the gold standard for the diagnosis of coronavirus infections. However, there are inevitably many false positive and false negative results, which are often caused by sample contamination and damage to genetic material.18 In 2003, some studies reported on the detection of virus particles in conjunctival secretions among SARS patients.19 Researchers in Hong Kong obtained conjunctival secretions and conjunctival cells from 17 confirmed cases and tested them via viral RT\u2010PCR; the results were all negative. Researchers in Singapore also tested conjunctival secretions obtained from 34 highly suspected cases via RT\u2010PCR assay and found that three of the patients had positive results, although their pharyngeal secretions yielded negative results. Of course, the Singaporean researchers also mentioned the possibility of sample contamination during sampling, but due to the shortcomings of RT\u2010PCR technology, the existence of false negatives could not be ruled out.8 On the basis of the results of our research, we collected tear and conjunctival secretions twice at an interval of 2 to 3 days and the results showed good consistency. Therefore, we were sure that SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 existed in tears and conjunctival secretions in NCP patients with conjunctivitis. For patients without conjunctivitis, we detected no virus in tears and conjunctival secretions indicating that it is not a common route of its transmission. Nevertheless, the risk of transmission could not be completely eliminated.\nThe present study assessed the tears and conjunctival secretions in SARS\u2010CoV\u20102\u2010infected patients. The results showed that the virus existed in the patients' tears and conjunctival secretions with conjunctivitis and there was no virus in the patients' conjunctival sac without conjunctivitis. However, this study had several limitations. First, the included sample size was relatively small. Simultaneously, although the samples were collected by the professional ophthalmologist (JHX), the collected tear and conjunctival secretions were limited, so sample concentration might be insufficient for RT\u2010PCR detection of the virus. Therefore, the possibility of virus particles in tear and conjunctival secretions in NCP patients without conjunctivitis cannot be completely ruled out. Second, only one patient enrolled got conjunctivitis and the virus was detected from his conjunctival secretion. However, the virus was not successfully isolated and cultured in the conjunctival secretion of the patient. We cannot tell whether all NCP patients with viral conjunctivitis exist with the virus in their conjunctival sac and whether the virus causes conjunctivitis. In addition, most patients in this study received antiviral treatment before sampling. Although sputum samples were also tested for comparison, the effect of drug treatment on the results could not be excluded. Therefore, further large\u2010sample and more comprehensive studies are needed to evaluate the role of novel coronaviruses in the eyes.5 CONCLUSION\nWe speculate that SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 may be detected in the tears and conjunctival secretions in NCP patients with conjunctivitis. Further high\u2010volume studies are warranted to evaluate this issue.CONFLICT OF INTERESTS\nThe authors declare that there are no conflict of interests.AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS\nJHX took part in sample collection.

The admixed Bat\u2010CoV sub\u2010populations indicate that bats serve as reservoirs harboring virus ensembles that are responsible for zoonotic spillovers such as SARS\u2010CoV and SARS\u2010CoV\u20102. The extent of admixed isolates of Bat\u2010CoVs observed in population diversification studies underline the need for periodic surveillance of bats and other animal reservoirs for potential spillovers as a measure towards preparedness for emergence of zoonosis.\nThis article is protected by copyright.

This novel HCoV may be able to use the human angiotensin\u2010converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) cell receptor for viral cell entry, as do the SARS\u2010CoV and HCoV\u2010NL63 strains.11, 14 Although, binding of HCoV\u2010NL63 to heparan sulfates is also required for viral attachment and infection of target cells.14 There was the concern that in addition to neutralization, antibodies could also enhance infection by SARS\u2010CoV.15 Little is known at this point about the antigenicity of the novel HCoV strain (COVID\u201019), human innate and adaptive immune responses to it, if infection provides protection from reinfection, and whether cytokine induction may enhance pathogenicity in more severe illnesses.\nAntibodies to HCoV\u2010229E, \u2010NL63, \u2010OC43, and \u2010HKU1 may be cross\u2010reactive among viral strains, at least within each HCoV genus due to conserved viral antigenic epitopes, may include those with neutralizing function, and be induced by repeated infections earlier in life.2-5 Hence, serologic reactivity to these common HCoV strains may be different among chronically ill older adults compared to younger adults. In a previous study of older adults with underlying chronic pulmonary disease,16 we reported that serum immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies to all four HCoV strains were prevalent in most study subjects, but mucosal immunoglobulin A antibodies to the four common HCoV strains in nasal wash specimens were detected in a minority of patients. Mucosal immune responses also deserve further study with respect to mitigation of HCoV infections. Although, the COVID\u201019 strain may target infection of the lower respiratory tree due to its purported receptor usage.11\nNeutralizing antibody is directed against the HCoV Spike (S) protein and may be protective, while other nonfunctional binding antibodies are directed against other viral proteins.3, 4, 6 In this report, we assessed whether neutralizing antibodies to these HCoV strains were present and increased during acute RI that were chosen for further study because of association with increases in binding antibodies to HCoV strains or detection of HCoV viral nucleic acid in respiratory secretions. We assessed correlations between serum binding and neutralizing antibodies, and compared these antibody responses in older chronically ill adults to healthy young adults.2 MATERIALS AND METHODS\nThis prospective, observational study was conducted from November 2009 to July 2013 and assessed RI in patients aged \u226560 years with underlying chronic lung and heart disease (group 1, total N\u2009=\u200999 subjects, 74 RI assessed overall), and in healthy young adults aged 21 to 40 years (group 2, total N\u2009=\u2009101, 121 RI assessed overall).7 Enrolled subjects each participated for up to 2 years, received phone calls every 8 weeks to remind them to contact study personnel at the time of onset of acute RI, and were evaluated by a study physician and nurse in clinic when they had either three symptoms of acute RI or fever (body temperature \u226537.8\u00b0C) accompanied by two symptoms of acute RI, as described.7 Sera were obtained at study enrollment, and in the subjects with subsequent RI within 5 days of onset time (acute) and 3 to 4 weeks later (convalescent). Respiratory secretions collected by nasal and oropharyngeal swabbing within 5 days of onset of acute RI were tested for nucleic acids of HCoV strains and other respiratory viruses (multiplex RT\u2010PCR using xTAG Respiratory Viral Panel Fast; Luminex Molecular Diagnostics, Inc, Toronto, Ontario, Canada). The study was approved by the responsible institutional review boards at Saint Louis University and the Veterans Affairs (VA) St Louis Health Care System and was performed in compliance with relevant laws and institutional guidelines and in accordance with the ethical standards of the declaration of Helsinki. Written informed consent was obtained from all study subjects.\nThe HCoV\u2010229E, \u2010OC43, and \u2010NL63 antigens used for detection of binding antibody by enzyme\u2010linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) were prepared from virus grown in MRC\u20105, HCT\u20108, and LLC\u2010MK2 cells, respectively, from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA). HCoV\u2010229E and \u2010OC43 were from ATCC and \u2010NL63 was a gift from Lia van der Hoek, University of Amsterdam. Mock antigen was prepared from uninfected cells.7, 8, 16 Virus\u2010infected cells were frozen and thawed three times, the supernatant fluid was clarified of cell debris by centrifugation, the virus was concentrated by overnight centrifugation, and the virus pellet was resuspended in phosphate\u2010buffered saline. The concentrated virus was inactivated by psoralen compound (Sigma, St Louis, MO), followed by irradiation by long\u2010wavelength UV light, as described.17, 18 This method of viral inactivation does not affect viral antigenicity. Mock antigen was prepared, in the same way, from uninfected cells.17, 18 HCoV\u2010HKU1 has not been grown using standard tissue culture techniques, so His6\u2010tagged recombinant nucleoprotein (N) of HCoV\u2010HKU1 and mock antigen that was produced from the same plasmid DNA vector without the N protein gene were used as antigens to detect antibody to \u2010HKU1, as described.7, 8, 16 Viral and mock antigens, the same stocks throughout the assays, were used to coat flat\u2010bottom 96\u2010well Maxisorp Immunoplates (Nalge\u2010Nunc International, Rochester, NY) followed by the sequence of serum in serial dilutions, mouse anti\u2010human IgG conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (Accurate Chemical and Scientific, Westbury, NY) and peroxidase substrate (KPL, Gaithersburg, MD). Optical density was measured at 405\u2009nm in a spectrophotometer. The anti\u2010HCoV serum antibody titer was calculated by the reference\u2010line least\u2010squares\u2010fit method, as described.8, 16, 19 Positive and negative control sera were assayed to confirm consistency between assays. Also, all sera from each subject were evaluated in the same assay to avoid inter\u2010assay variability.\nThe neutralizing antibody assay assessed percentage of cell killing by HCoV. This colorimetric bioassay was based on the ability of live cells to reduce the yellow tetrazolium salt, 3\u2010(4,5\u2010dimethylthiazol\u20102\u2010yl), 2,5\u2010diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT; Sigma\u2010Aldrich, St Louis, MO), to its blue formazan derivative, as described.20 Sera were serially diluted, incubated with equal volume of fixed\u2010dose HCoV (predetermined stock virus dilution that killed about 75% of the cells, generally at 100 tissue culture infectious dose 50 per unit volume) and then transferred to a 96\u2010well plate containing a monolayer of the appropriate tissue culture cells that support growth of the HCoV virus strain. When about 70% to 80% of the control infected cells exhibited cytopathic effect, MTT was added and the absorbance at 492\u2009nm of the formazan produced by live cells was measured spectrophotometrically. A titration curve plotted the percentage of cell survival relative to controls (% survival) vs log10 reciprocal of serum dilution. The plot was analyzed using nonlinear regression (GraphPad Software, Prism Version 6.02; San Diego, CA) to determine the serum dilution required to protect 50% of the cells from the cytotoxic effects of HCoV. The same virus stocks were used throughout the assays and positive and negative control sera were assayed to assure reproducibility. Also, all sera from each subject were evaluated in the same assay to avoid inter\u2010assay variability.\nDescriptive statistics, Fisher's exact test, and nonparametric statistical tests were used to compare proportions and continuous variables, and the Spearman rank\u2010order test to assess correlations. The statistical analysis was done using STATISTICA Release 7 software (StatSoft, Inc, Tulsa, OK).3 RESULTS\nThe geometric mean binding antibody titers (GMT) by ELISA in the study enrollment sera were higher in the entire group 1 compared to group 2 subjects (group 1, N\u2009=\u200999 vs group 2, N\u2009=\u2009101; HCoV\u2010229E: 1582 vs 619, P\u2009<\u2009.000001; \u2010OC43: 1709 vs 1656, P\u2009=\u2009NS; \u2010NL63: 342 vs 296, P\u2009=\u2009NS; and \u2010HKU1: 266 vs 225, P\u2009=\u2009NS).\nThere were 74 RI assessed in groups 1 and 121 RI assessed in group 2 subjects of which 43 illnesses were associated with HCoV infection by serologic change or PCR positivity for HCoV. The other most common respiratory virus associated with RI in the parent study was entero/rhinovirus detected by polymerase chain reaction, as described.7 Sera bracketing these 43 HCoV\u2010associated RI were the focus of study in the following analyses, because they were most likely to provide information about the utility of measuring binding and neutralizing antibodies to the four common strains of HCoV. Of the 43 illnesses, 15 (35%) occurred in 14 older adults (group 1, mean age\u2009=\u200967.8\u2009\u00b1\u20097.5 years; min, max: 60, 85 years), and 28 (65%) in 28 younger adults (group 2, mean age\u2009=\u200931.4\u2009\u00b1\u20095.7 years; min, max: 21, 40 years). A total of 42 RI had a more than threefold increase in binding antibody to one or more HCoV strains comparing acute to convalescent serum antibody titers, including 14 RI with a more than threefold increase to two or three strains, and one RI with HCoV\u2010OC43 in respiratory secretions with no increase in binding antibody. The RI with more than threefold increases in binding antibody titer included nine illnesses (three in group 1 and six in group 2) to HCoV\u2010229E of which three were \u2265fourfold, 17 to \u2010NL63 (five in group 1 and 12 in group 2) of which 13 were \u2265fourfold, 17 to \u2010OC43 (eight in group 1 and nine in group 2) of which eight were \u2265fourfold, and 18 to \u2010HKU1 (six in group 1 and 12 in group 2) of which 14 were \u2265fourfold. Eight (53.3%) of 15 RI in group 1 and 19 (70.3%) of 27 RI in group 2 had a \u2265fourfold increase in binding antibody to one or more HCoV (P\u2009=\u2009NS).\nNeutralizing antibodies to HCoV\u2010229E, \u2010NL63, and \u2010OC43 were detected in all but two acute RI sera. The two were from group 2 subjects who had no detectable neutralization activity against \u2010229E. There were 11 RI (six in group 1, five in group 2) with \u2265fourfold rise in neutralizing antibody titer to HCoV\u2010229E, six (two in group 1 and four in group 2) to \u2010NL63 and four (one in group 1 and three in group 2) to \u2010OC43, and of these, four RI had an accompanying \u2265fourfold rise in neutralizing antibody to both HCoV\u2010229E and \u2010NL63 with one also having a \u2265fourfold increase against HCoV\u2010OC43. Therefore, the total number of RI with a rise in neutralization antibody titer to one or more HCoV strains was 16, 7 (46.7%) in groups 1 and 9 (33.3%) in group 2. A more than threefold increase in ELISA antibody titer was a predictor in only a minority of illnesses of an increase in neutralizing antibody to HCoV (Table 1).

Six serum pairs had a concomitant more than threefold rise in ELISA antibody titer to three HCoV strains. One of the 43 illnesses included in this table did not have a more than threefold increase in ELISA antibody titer, but had HCoV\u2010OC43 detected in respiratory secretions and a fourfold rise in neutralizing antibody to \u2010OC43.\nSeven of the 43 RI had HCoV nucleic acids detected in respiratory secretions (one for HCoV\u2010229E in group 1, one for \u2010HKU1 in group 2, and three in group 1, and two in group 2 for \u2010OC43). Six of the seven had accompanying more than threefold increases in binding antibody of which four were \u2265fourfold increases to one or more HCoV strains.

Of these, one RI in group 1 and one in group 2 had HCoV\u2010OC43 nucleic acid positivity with \u2265fourfold increases in \u2010OC43 neutralizing antibody, and one RI in group 1 had \u2010OC43 nucleic acid positivity inexplicably accompanied by \u2265fourfold increases in \u2010229E and \u2010NL63 neutralizing antibodies, but with a fourfold rise in binding antibodies to \u2010NL63 and \u2010HKU1).\nConsidering all acute and convalescent sera from the 43 RI, GMTs were higher in group 1 than group 2 subjects for binding antibodies to HCoV\u2010229E and \u2010HKU1, and for neutralizing antibodies to \u2010229E and \u2010OC43 (Figure 1). For acute illness sera, GMTs of binding antibody to \u2010229E were higher in group 1 than group 2 and for convalescent sera, GMTs of binding antibody to HCoV\u2010229E and neutralizing antibody to \u2010229E were higher in group 1 than group 2 subjects (Figure 1).\nFigure 1\nOpen in figure viewerPowerPoint\nGeometric mean titers (GMT) of antibodies by two methods to human coronaviruses (HCoV) \u2010229E, \u2010NL63, \u2010OC43, and \u2010HKU1 are shown by age group (15 serum pairs from group 1 subjects who were 60\u201085 years of age and 28 serum pairs from group 2 subjects who were 21\u201040 years of age) and by time of serum collection (acute, collected within five days of onset of acute respiratory illness, and convalescent, collected 3\u20104 weeks later). \u201cAll visits\u201d refer to the GMT of both acute and convalescent sera together by the patient subject group.

Convalescent serum titers were correlated between binding and neutralizing antibodies to HCoV\u2010NL63 (R\u2009=\u2009.549, P\u2009<\u2009.05) and to \u2010OC43 (R\u2009=\u2009.517, P\u2009<\u2009.05), and for binding antibodies between \u2010OC43 and \u2010HKU1 (R\u2009=\u2009.717, P\u2009<\u2009.01). In group 2 subjects, the acute illness serum binding antibody titers were correlated between \u2010OC43 and \u2010HKU1 (R\u2009=\u2009.390, P\u2009<\u2009.05). Convalescent serum binding antibody titers were correlated between HCoV\u2010229E and \u2010NL63 (R\u2009=\u2009.403, P\u2009<\u2009.05), and between binding and neutralizing antibodies to \u2010OC43 (R\u2009=\u2009.555, P\u2009<\u2009.001). For both groups of subjects combined, the convalescent serum binding and neutralizing antibody titers were correlated for HCoV\u2010NL63 (R\u2009=\u2009.394, P\u2009<\u2009.01) and, also, separately for \u2010OC43 (R\u2009=\u2009.565, P\u2009<\u2009.0001), and binding antibodies were correlated between \u2010OC43 and \u2010HKU1 (R\u2009=\u2009.460, P\u2009<\u2009.001).4 DISCUSSION\nReinfection with coronaviruses is reportedly common despite the presence of a humoral immune response.21, 22 Except for one subject, only one RI was associated with HCoV infection per subject in our study. This lack of repeated HCoV infections may have been influenced by there being 0.98 RI per subject meeting eligibility criteria for assessment during the study, and it is not known how often a clinically significant natural exposure to HCoV might have occurred causing risk for infection. Since preexisting serum antibodies were present, they did not necessarily provide protection from infection with HCoV, but may have reduced the number of clinically evaluable infections and severity. The PCR was positive for HCoV nucleic acids only in a minority of RI in this study, so antibodies may have reduced virus shedding that was detectable in respiratory secretions during acute illness. Time of specimen collection after onset of RI could have affected PCR positivity rates, as well. A seroconversion threshold for binding antibody titers of more than threefold in association with acute RI was an inconsistent predictor of concomitant fourfold neutralizing antibody change, and \u2265fourfold changes in binding antibodies were not statistically better. Antibody GMTs to each HCoV strain did not increase statistically comparing acute to convalescent sera calculated with values from all 43 illnesses. These GMTs were calculated because of the evidence for cross\u2010reactive antibody responses against at least related strains (Alphacoronaviruses vs Betacoronaviruses). Choosing to calculate a separate GMT for only the subset of sera with a more than threefold change to one HCoV strain would have assured a significant rise in GMT for that strain against which there was this more than threefold binding antibody change.\nThere were fewer numbers of HCoV infections and of reported RI overall in older patients. This could be consistent with higher antibody levels or other immune mechanisms of protection compared to younger patients. Enrollment binding antibody titers were higher in group 1 than group 2 subjects. However, the actual proportion of RI that were associated with HCoV by serologic change or PCR was not different comparing the two groups. A total of 15 (20.3%) of 74 RI in group 1 were assessed as being associated with HCoV infection compared to 28 (23.1%) of 121 illnesses in group 2. It is not known what might constitute a protective antibody level against HCoV infection.\nConcomitant increases in binding antibody to more than one viral strain were likely due to the stimulation of antibodies against conserved cross\u2010reactive antigens expressed by the current infecting strain of HCoV and, due to recall of immune memory, to other strains that previously infected the person earlier in life. Concomitant infection with more than one strain of HCoV during the same RI would be unlikely. Repeated infections with HCoV may partially be explained if natural infection in these adult patients stimulates binding antibodies more commonly than functional neutralizing antibodies. Nonneutralizing antibodies are known to bind to other viral proteins such as the N protein. Stimulation of antibodies to non\u2010S protein epitopes could be an explanation for low correlation between stimulation of binding antibody and neutralizing antibody since neutralizing antibody is directed against the S protein. The psoralen\u2010UV light method of virus inactivation used here should have preserved viral antigenicity, but we did not determine against which viral proteins the binding antibodies were directed. The orientation of the viral antigens coating the ELISA microtiter plates may have affected the epitopes exposed and available for antibody binding. Also, it is possible that some binding antibodies may enhance infection and not be protective against reinfection. Antibody\u2010dependent enhancement of SARS\u2010CoV and feline infectious peritonitis virus (a member of the coronavirus genus and antigenically related to \u2010229E) infectivity has been reported and can be mediated by antibodies to S protein epitopes.15, 23-25 Also, studies of the S protein sequence and neutralization antigenicity suggest that serum antibodies which neutralize clinical HCoV isolates may not cross\u2010react as well with the laboratory strains of HCoV that were used in our neutralization assays, affecting the sensitivity of the neutralization assay that was employed here.4, 6 Indeed, quasi\u2010species of HCoV\u2010OC43 were detected in respiratory secretions in our patients, with mutational peaks in the S1 region of the Spike protein that could lead to differences in antigenicity,26 and lower neutralization antibody levels and response rates against laboratory\u2010adapted strains.\nOlder (group 1) subjects had higher levels of binding and neutralizing antibodies both before and after acute RI than younger subjects (group 2), probably due to previous infections with cross\u2010reactive HCoV strains over a longer life\u2010time. The binding antibodies that were detected in the ELISA, utilizing inactivated whole HCoV\u2010229E, \u2010OC43, and \u2010NL63 viruses, were likely directed against more HCoV proteins than just the S protein compared to the neutralizing antibodies that are directed against epitopes of the S protein. The method of virus inactivation that was used may have preserved the integrity of virions and their antigenicity. We did not confirm that binding antibodies detected in the ELISA were directed against more than the S protein antigens. Only binding antibodies to the recombinant N protein could be measured in the case of \u2010HKU1. There were positive statistical correlations between binding antibody levels in both acute and convalescent sera within HCoV genera. There appeared to be closer correlations between binding antibodies and neutralizing antibodies in the convalescent sera than acute illness sera particularly for HCoV\u2010NL63 and for \u2010OC43, respectively, and closer binding antibody correlations between strains within the Alphacoronavirus (HCoV\u2010229E and \u2010NL63) and between strains within the Betacoronavirus (HCoV\u2010OC43 and \u2010HKU1) genera.\nThe preexisting serologic status against various strains of coronavirus among patients undergoing acute infection during the serious current outbreak of COVID\u201019 virus and their immune responses to COVID\u201019 infection are not known. Patients with MERS\u2010CoV infections are seronegative at onset of illness and can develop both binding and potentially protective neutralizing antibodies that correlate in convalescent sera. Delayed serologic responses occur in those with more severe illness and higher viral shedding.10 In contradistinction, our HCoV\u2010experienced subjects were already seropositive for the four strains at onset of the RI. Increases in binding antibodies bracketing RI, signaling likely intercurrent HCoV infection, were more frequent than increased neutralizing antibodies and viral nucleic acids detected in respiratory secretions, and more frequent in young compared to older adults. There were correlations between binding and neutralizing antibodies for homologous and for related HCoV strains, though not statistically significant for all comparisons. It is unlikely that there were simultaneous infections with more than one strain of HCoV, so concomitant increases in binding and neutralizing antibodies to more than one strain was consistent with stimulation of cross\u2010reactive antibodies and recall of immune memory. Susceptibility to repeated infections with HCoV may be explained in part by a stimulation of neutralizing antibodies in a minority of RI with increases in binding antibodies. Since binding antibodies increased more commonly than neutralizing antibodies, they may be a more sensitive seroepidemiological tool than neutralizing antibodies for identifying RI due to common HCoV strains.ACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThe authors thank Kiana Wilder for secretarial assistance and the Center for Vaccine Development at Saint Louis University.

Through this letter, we would like to mention a few additional comments that we believe would be beneficial for our readers.\nSun et al1 rightly mentioned that old patients and patients with multiple comorbidities are more likely to have disease progression at a faster rate with higher mortality rates. A recent data published by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) mentioned that the older patients more than 80 years had a very high mortality rate (14.8% vs 0.2%) as compared with the younger population (between 10\u201039\u2009years; Figure 1). Also, Sun et al1 mentioned about the variation in the reported mortality rate by various studies.2-6 This could be due to multiple reasons: (a) the sickness profile of the patients presenting to a particular Medical Center; (b) age of the patient and previous health comorbidities; (c) health care resources available in the Medical Center to manage the complicated patients; (d) the level of critical care unit in the hospital and the individual expertise of the intensivists to manage complex COVID\u201019 patients with ARDS. Apart from this, few other concerns raised recently by the researchers are that there is a high possibility that asymptomatic patients or mildly sick COVID\u20102019 cases are not coming to the hospital. Contrarily, there is also a possibility that very sick patients might be dying in the community before reaching to the hospital.5-7\nFigure 1\nOpen in figure viewerPowerPoint\nMortality rates as per various age groups. COVID\u20102019, coronavirus disease 2019\nSun et al1 also mentioned the laboratory findings and imaging characteristics in patients suffering from COVID\u20102019. Wu et al8 in their study recently reported ground\u2010glass opacities (91%), consolidation (63%), and interlobular subtle thickening (59%) in their 80\u2010patient data. They also calculated the degree of pulmonary inflammation and found that the pulmonary inflammation index (PII) significantly correlated with procalcitonin levels, lymphocyte and monocyte count, and CRP levels. This suggests that the patients who had worse pulmonary inflammation are also likely to have more deranged laboratory findings and complications. Another study on the CT imaging findings was done by Berheim et al9 on 121 COVID\u20102019 disease patients. They found that patients who presented early, that is, within 48\u2009hours of symptom onset, 56% of them had a normal CT. They also did a follow\u2010up imaging, which showed that the CT findings became more frequent and worse when compared with the baseline imaging as the time interval progressed from the initial onset of symptoms. The most common lung lobes involved were right lower lobe and left lower lobe in 65% and 63% patients, respectively. Similarly, Wu et al8 found the dorsal segment of the right lower lobe (86%) and a posterior basal segment of the right lower lobe (85%) as the most common segment involved.9\nSun et al1 also mentioned about the pathogenesis of 2019\u2010nCoV and the role of ACE2 receptors in lung damage. As mentioned by them, Asians have higher levels of ACE2 expression and are more susceptible to SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 as compared to Whites/African Americans. Based on these characteristics, it would be interesting to compare the patients from different ethnicity for the difference in intensity of sickness, duration of hospital stay, requirement of ICU level of care, and mortality outcomes. In general, immunocompromised individuals like patients with cancer, human immunodeficiency virus\u2010positive cases are more prone to opportunistic infections and acquiring a SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection is likely to worsen the situation.10\nWith regard to the treatment, many antiviral agents are in various phases of clinical trials, namely Darunavir/Cobicistat (Gov Identifier: NCT04252274), Lopinavir/Ritonavir (Gov Identifier: NCT04261907). Recently, National Institutes of Health initiated a clinical trial (ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT 04280705) at the University of Nebraska, Omaha, to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of remdesivir in hospitalized adults diagnosed with COVID\u201019 (Figure 2). Similarly, many other trials have been initiated to evaluate the complications of COVID\u20102019, psychosocial effects on the health care providers, newer diagnostic tools, and so forth (ClinicalTrials.gov). Unfortunately, all these clinical trials would be helpful at a later date, when the study is over, data are assimilated, and only then results will be analyzed. Hence, the only immediate and most effective strategy available is to follow the conventional infection control techniques and social hygiene practices. The World Health Organization (WHO) and the CDC has actively involved its members and is regularly addressing various aspects of this outbreak and issuing guidelines. Unfortunately, during this crisis time, many rumors are being spread with regard to the modes of transmission, treatment, and so forth, which could potentially create a panic amongst the general public. To provide the most scientific and the latest information, WHO has initiated a special web page \u201cmyth busters\u201d in which many common rumors are busted with logical explanations.11\nFigure 2\nOpen in figure viewerPowerPoint\nTimeline of updates on 2019\u2010nCoV\nIn conclusion, researchers, scientists, and treating physicians are relentlessly working with an attempt to decode the exact source of infection, modes of transmission, virus microbiological characteristics, most effective treatment strategy, and vaccine development. Currently, the situation with regard to SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 is evolving dramatically and many latest updates are expected in the coming weeks.CONFLICT OF INTERESTS\nThe authors declare that there are no conflict of interests.AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS\nAll authors have seen the manuscript and agree to the content and data.

The disease (coronavirus disease [COVID\u201019]) rapidly spread to neighboring countries and overseas, reaching pandemic proportions and was declared by the World Health Organization (WHO) as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern on 30 January, 2020.4 As of 19 April, 2020, the WHO has reported 2\u2009241\u2009359 confirmed cases with 152\u2009551 deaths worldwide,5 a total of 185 countries affected, while 10 still remain with no reported cases.6\nThe main diagnostic test that has been implemented worldwide to confirm the infection by this novel coronavirus is the real\u2010time reverse transcriptase\u2010polymerase chain reaction (RT\u2010PCR) from respiratory samples with satisfactory levels of sensibility and specificity.7 However, there might be other clinical specimens where the virus could be detected as well, using the same technique.8-10 The procedure takes about a day to come up with a result11; however, more efficient methods are being developed as the pandemic progresses. A crucial part of the public health response to this new threat is to rapidly diagnose and isolate infected individuals to prevent further spreading.12, 13 Therefore, amplifying the testing capacity of a country experiencing a massive outbreak, is a key strategy for facing this new public health emergency.14 Nowadays, the United States is the country with a greater number of confirmed cases worldwide and performs as of 19 April, 2020, 167\u2009330 tests daily, with a total of 3\u2009865\u2009864 tests performed since the beginning of the outbreak15 with all states currently testing.16 Other largely affected countries are also performing thousands of confirmatory tests on a daily basis.17 However, due to the overwhelming number of rapidly growing cases, a considerably large number of suspected cases cannot be properly tested and isolated due to the lack of logistics of a progressively collapsing healthcare system. Therefore, it becomes urgent to optimize the standard operating procedures to confirm the infection by SARS\u2010CoV\u20102.18\nSince the clinical presentation of the disease is often mild or asymptomatic,19, 20 and that it has been reported that asymptomatic individuals could transmit the virus,21, 22 it becomes crucial to implement an efficient testing strategy to screen that population and properly isolate them to prevent the further spread of the virus. However, as the healthcare systems around the world are progressively collapsing due to the increasing demand of moderate to severe patients that every day present to the emergency room, the testing of individuals with low clinical suspicion has been left behind, in order to prioritize the available resources for the patients with moderate to severe symptoms. Although it becomes quite logical to prioritize testing for patients with higher clinical suspicion, there is a considerable segment of the population that is not being screened and become vectors of the virus, contributing even more to the spread of the disease and further collapse the healthcare system with the new cases yet to come.23\nOn the other hand, as proposed by Seifried and Ciesek,24 a pool testing strategy could potentially increase worldwide testing capacity many times over, thus, boosting a country's capacity to test mild to asymptomatic individuals. This strategy proposes that instead of individually testing patients with low clinical suspicion of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102, samples are pooled together in what is called a minipool, and then tested together running a single RT\u2010PCR for all the unified samples. Preliminary results show that there is no dilution and no decrease on test sensitivity when minipools of five samples each are used,24 and since the RT\u2010PCR looks directly at the viral ARN, a negative result in a pool test is reliable. Thus, discarding the infection in all the patients included in the pooled sample. On the other hand, if a group tests positive, then a round of individual tests to each patient is performed to track the individuals with the infection in that specific pool of samples. With this strategy, mass testing becomes a not so prohibitive public health measure, especially in settings where access to the tests is not optimal. This way, massive savings on particular test kits can be done and can quickly enable to better estimate the number of people that are actually infected. This methodology has shown to be an effective strategy for screening other pathogens that affected humans before the outbreak, such as HIV, malaria, chlamydia, and influenza.25 However, some studies suggest that the pooling of the sample should be kept as low as possible to reduce dilution and maintain the sensitivity of the test.26, 27\nSince the scope of this strategy could potentially increase multiple times the testing capacity of a country, it becomes prudent to explore how to optimize the implementation of it in the healthcare setting. Therefore, the aim of this study is to provide a mathematical model to estimate the optimum number of pooled samples according to the specific prevalences of positive tests in a particular country context, in order to save as many tests as possible and cover as many people as possible, knowing that if a group tests out positive, all the individuals of the sample would have to be individually tested. It is important to highlight that this model is based on the prevalence of positive tests and can be adapted to each country's specific prevalence. However, it is best implemented for countries with a large number of confirmed cases and relatively large number of tests performed on a daily basis, since more data on the specific prevalence of positive yielding results are available and more accurate estimations can be done based on this; rather than countries with a low number of confirmed cases or where the implementation of testing the population has not been the most adequate.\nThe manuscript is arranged in the following way: in Section 2, the materials and methods are introduced. In Section 3, the results are given together with the discussion. Finally, the final remarks are presented in Section 4.2 MATERIALS AND METHODS\nThoughtful description of the process and reasoning for obtaining a formula that represents the benefit of performing a pool test of the most optimum size assuming in advance that if a group tests out positive, all the subjects in the group have to be individually tested, in order to track down the positive case or cases, while if a group tests out negative, then no further testing in that specific group is needed. All the computations were performed with the software Wolfram Mathematica.28\n2.1 Model\nConsidering that the sample of each suspected individual tested for the infection of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 with the RT\u2010PCR could yield either a negative or positive result, and that performing a pool testing strategy could yield a negative result only when all the samples included in the pool sample are negative, and that it will yield a positive result when at least one of the individual samples is positive, the possible diagnostic scenarios for the pool test can be expressed by the binomial expression of\n(1)\nwhere x represents the probability of subjects with an individual positive test (prevalence of positives), y represents the probability of subjects with an individual negative test (prevalence of negatives), and n is size of the pool group. Such that n\u2009>\u20091, 0\u2009<\u2009x\u2009<\u20091, and y\u2009=\u20091\u2009\u2212\u2009x. Under these assumptions, we obtain that D\u2009=\u20091. Note that the breakdown of this expression will hold all the possible events. This will be represented by the addends, and the combination present in these will be determined by x and y and its respective exponent, which will indicate the number of subjects with a positive or negative sample, respectively. The distribution of the possibilities will depend on the prevalence of the disease, in this case, being the percentage of positive test results obtained from the recent historical data available. For this reason, the probability of each expressed event occurring, will be determined by the substitution of x and y by the respective prevalences of positive and negative tests. Now, let us separate Equation (1) in two parts\n(2)\nHere, the negative groups for the pool test and its probability will be represented by yn, while the pool tests that yield a positive will correspond to all the other cases where there is at least one individual positive sample in the pool, having, therefore, a 1\u2009\u2212\u2009yn probability of becoming true. To facilitate the use of Equation (3), it will be expressed as a function of x, which relates to the direct prevalence of positive historical testing for each country, so that it can be inputted in the equation. Therefore, considering that every time a pool test yields a negative result, no further testing will be performed to that group, the saved tests of the otherwise individually tested subjects, will be expressed as n\u2009\u2212\u20091, while if the pool test yields a positive result, every subject in the pooled group will have to be tested individually, thus wasting one test. Based on this, the number of saved tests for each group can be expressed as a net gain per group of pool test (NGpt):\n(3)\nDeveloping further, if the NGpt strategy is divided by the subjects included in the group, then the net gain per subject tested (NGst) is obtained:\n(4)\nFinally, to obtain the average minimum number of tests needed to diagnose one person using a pool testing strategy (z), the NGst has to be subtracted from 1 (the total):\n(5)\nTo obtain the optimum group size given the prevalence of positive tests (x) in a determined setting, the minimal global of Equation (5) must be obtained. This minimum value is calculated using x as the input, because x is a continuous variable, while n is a discrete one.\nFigure 1 shows a contour plot of the average minimum number of tests in, z, as a function of x and n. The color code represents the different values of the z function. We can observe different regimes with higher values for large values of x and n.\nFigure 1\nOpen in figure viewerPowerPoint\nContour plot of the average minimum number of tests per subject to diagnose one subject.

It is clear that there is an optimal value of n in which the function z has a global minimum. We have numerically tested that the minimum for finite value of n is only until x\u2009=\u20090.3. For higher values of x, the minimum of z is when n tends to infinity, and therefore the model is no longer useful.\nFigure 2\nOpen in figure viewerPowerPoint\nAverage minimum number of tests as a function of the group size n for different values of x.

Different colors represent the different prevalences, x, and the shape of the curve represents how the model behaves in function of n at the specific prevalences listed on the figure\nLet us remark that, knowing the average minimum number of tests per subject needed to diagnose one subject, then the population covered by one test using a pool testing strategy according to the optimal pool size previously calculated (and addressing the fact that when a group yields a positive result, the whole group has to be individually tested), can be expressed as3 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION\nWith the model proposed above, different scenarios were tested according to different prevalences of positive tests. This was done to address the fact that each country presents a unique distribution of daily performed tests and positive results. According to this, the optimum size and average minimum tests per subject to detect a positive for the diverse chosen prevalence scenarios were calculated. Then, it was further compared to the individual testing strategy and how many more positive results could be detected using pool testing, with the same amount of tests, thus, addressing the efficiency of the strategy over individual testing, as shown on Table 1.\nTable 1. Optimum group size and additional subjects diagnosed for every 100 tests using pool testing strategy compared as to individual testing\nPrevalence of positive tests using historical data (x) Optimum group size(n) Average minimum number of tests per subject to diagnose 1 subject (z) Positive subjects detected for every 100 individual tests performed Positive subjects detected for every 100 tests performed using test and retest strategy Additional positive subjects detected for every 100 tests using pooled samples rather that individual samples\n0.01 11 0.196 1 5.12 4.12\n0.02 8 0.274 2 7.29 5.29\n0.03 6 0.334 3 8.99 5.99\n0.04 6 0.384 4 10.42 6.42\n0.05 5 0.426 5 11.73 6.73\n0.06 5 0.466 6 12.88 6.88\n0.07 4 0.502 7 13.95 6.95\n0.08 4 0.534 8 14.99 6.99\n0.09 4 0.564 9 15.95 6.95\n0.1 4 0.594 10 16.84 6.84\n0.15 3 0.719 15 20.86 5.86\n0.2 3 0.821 20 24.35 4.35\n0.25 3 0.911 25 27.43 2.43\n0.3 3 0.99 30 30.29 0.29\nOn the other hand, given the optimum group sizes calculated for the chosen prevalence scenarios, the population covered by a 100 tests was calculated using the average minimum test per subject to detect a positive, and was compared the 100 subjects that an individual testing strategy would cover, as it is exposed in Table 2.\nTable 2. Population covered using both strategies according to the optimum group size and average minimum test needed to detect a positive result\nPrevalence of positive tests using historical data (x) Average minimum number of tests per subject to diagnose 1 subject (z) Subjects tested in 100 tests using individual testing Subjects tested in 100 tests using pool testing according to optimum group number\n0.01 0.196 100 511.5\n0.02 0.274 100 364.7\n0.03 0.334 100 299.8\n0.04 0.384 100 260.5\n0.05 0.426 100 234.6\n0.06 0.466 100 214.6\n0.07 0.502 100 199.2\n0.08 0.534 100 187.4\n0.09 0.564 100 177.2\n0.1 0.594 100 168.4\n0.15 0.719 100 139.0\n0.2 0.821 100 121.8\n0.25 0.911 100 109.7\n0.3 0.99 100 101.0\nAs exposed in the results, the lower the prevalence of positive tests for a particular country is, the more tests that can be saved and the larger the pool groups will be. From prevalences ranging from 0.03 to 0.07, the testing capacity of a country using a pool testing strategy is increased by a factor of two or by a factor three, rather than using individual testing. This could bring unprecedented advances in better understanding the disease and how it distributes on a particular population. From prevalence ranging from 0.08 to 0.2, the net saving of test kits using pool testing strategy is still significant, saving around 46.6% to 17.9% of the tests if an individual testing strategy were to be performed in the same number of subjects, thus, covering a greater portion of the population. However, as prevalence rises, the efficiency of the strategy flattens. Reaching a prevalence over 0.25, the net saving of tests is still significant. However, separating the samples, creating pool groups, tracking individuals in the groups that yielded a positive result, and retesting all those subjects individually, suppose logistical challenges that every healthcare center must weigh to implement this strategy over the most likely already implemented individual testing strategy. Finally, reaching a prevalence near 0.3, the pool testing strategy becomes similar to the individual testing strategy, thus losing its effectiveness and becoming a logistical problem, rather than optimizing the testing protocols. This is mainly because in the model proposed, whenever a group tests positive, all the individuals of the group should get retested to track the positive subject or subjects in the pooled sample. Therefore, the more positive individuals there are in the population, the highest positive pool tests there will be. Thus, more tests will be lost, and more tests will be used in retesting the positive pool samples. Notice that for large positive groups, further subgrouping and pool testing of those subgroups could be implemented. This could potentially save even more tests; however, it is believed that this approach might suppose a difficult logistical challenge that the progressively collapsing healthcare systems worldwide might not be able to cope for now.\nAs of 19 April 2020, most countries have prevalences of positive tests that range around 0.1 to 0.2 of all the tests daily performed29 so a pool testing strategy is still a plausible strategy to implement on a national level. However, for the analysis, the overall historical prevalence was used as a country scenario, but when subjects are further stratified according to clinical suspicion, a lower prevalence of positive tests are expected in lower clinical suspicion groups, so the pool testing strategy could be best implemented in this stratified subgroup rather than the whole population. As it was previously exposed, lower prevalence of positive tests, show greater efficiency in the test use, however, with larger group sizes. One of the main critiques to the pool testing strategy, is the dilution that occurs when pooling the samples together, and how this dilution might affect the test sensitivity. Previous studies have shown that there is no decrease in sensitivity for RT\u2010PCR in detecting other viruses when using pool samples of 10 and 20 subjects,30 however, as far as the available evidence on SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 show, samples of five subjects do not affect sensibility of RT\u2010PCR for detecting the virus.24\nThe model proposes optimum group numbers that range from 11 to 3 subjects, depending on the individual prevalence. This exquisitely copes with the possibility that larger groups might decrease RT\u2010PCR sensitivity due to the dilution of the pooled sample and it has been proposed that to effectively implement poll testing strategy, the pooled samples should be kept as low as possible.26, 27 Further developing on this, the model predicts optimum groups of four and three subjects for the prevalence of positive tests that range from 0.1 to 0.2, which are the prevalence that most countries are reporting nowadays. Therefore, it adapts to the clinical reality that the frontline workers all over the world are experiencing on a daily basis.\nFinally, as more information becomes available on how big the group sizes can be without compromising the test sensitivity, further stratifying subjects according to clinical suspicion and testing those patients with low clinical suspicion via pool testing strategy should become the goal. This, because the model shows greater optimization of test usage with low prevalence of positive tests, and as it should be expected, patients with lower clinical suspicion, will most likely show lower prevalence of positive tests, thus increasing the efficiency of the strategy. Thus, pool testing individuals for SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 is a valuable strategy that could considerably boost a country's testing capacity, however, further studies are needed to address how large these groups can be, without losing sensitivity on the RT\u2010PCR.4 FINAL REMARKS\nThis article proposed a simple and landed model to estimate the most optimum group number to implement pool testing strategy for SARS\u2010CoV\u20102, according to the specific historical positive tests prevalence for a determined healthcare context. The aim of this model is to be implemented in different levels of healthcare facilities fighting the pandemic, given its flexibility to estimate the optimum group number, according to specific prevalence. These particular prevalences might differ from a healthcare facility to another, from one a city to another and might also differ from the country's overall outbreak status. Therefore, it helps to create a tailored to the context implementation of the pool testing strategy for testing individuals with suspected infection by SARS\u2010CoV\u20102.\nOne of the main limitations of this study is that it assumes that the RT\u2010PCR for detecting SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 has a 100% sensitivity to the viral ARN, when the evidence available shows sensitivity to be around 70%.31 However, astonishing work is currently being done to improve test sensitivity; and addressing this non perfect sensitivity would greatly increase the complexity of the model.\nFinally, it is worth mentioning the social implications that implementing pool testing might have. As the pandemic grows and more people get tested, implementing this testing strategy might not be well received by the general public, since patients most likely will want to know if their particular test yielded a positive or a negative result as soon as possible and will likely not accept their particular sample to be mixed with other samples. Therefore, it becomes crucial to develop a strong public health policy to inform the population, secure equal access, and best implement the strategy for the greater good.ACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThe authors are thankful to Dr Ricardo Segovia, MD (Hospital Regional de Arica Dr. Juan No\u00e9 Crevani), Prof Dr Gonzalo Vald\u00e9s (Universidad de Tarapac\u00e1), and Prof Dr Rafael Gonz\u00e1lez (Universidad Mayor) for useful discussions and their critical reading of the manuscript.

Phylogenetically, it belongs to the family Coronaviridae, order Nidovirales and is a \u03b2\u2010coronavirus of 2B group.4\nRegarding epidemiology, human\u2010to\u2010human transmission of the virus through the sneezes, cough, and respiratory droplets has been confirmed, yet the zoonotic nature has not been confirmed.5-7 Epidemiologic investigation in Wuhan, China identified an initial association with a seafood market where most patients had worked or visited.4 However, as the outbreak progressed, several confirmed cases were reported sporadically all over the world, showing the pandemic nature of the disease named as COVID\u201019. At last, on 30 January 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared this outbreak a public health emergency of international concern.8 According to the situation report 35 (reported by 24 February 2020) of WHO, in China, 77\u2009262 confirmed cases were reported, of which 2595 cases were with deaths. Moreover, outside of China, 2069 confirmed cases were reported in 29 other countries (https://www.who.int/docs/default\u2010source/coronaviruse/situation\u2010reports/20200224\u2010sitrep\u201035\u2010covid\u201019.pdf?sfvrsn=1ac4218d_2).\nTherefore, as the situation was getting worse and worse, the need for designing a suitable peptide vaccine component against the SARS\u2010COV\u20102 was growing. Our work was to find suitable epitopes, which can generate enough immune response against the SARS\u2010COV\u20102 infection. Using immunoinformatics, we could recognize and characterize potential B and T\u2010cell epitopes for the generation of the epitopic vaccine against SARS\u2010COV\u20102.9 Specifically, the spike glycoprotein of SARS\u2010COV\u20102 is considered as the target because it forms a characteristic crown of the virus and protrudes from the viral envelope.10 So, the protein sequence of spike glycoprotein was explored thoroughly using multiple immunoinformatic\u2010based servers and software, to identify various epitopes for an effective vaccine.2 MATERIALS AND METHODS\n2.1 Collection of targeted protein sequence\nThe amino acid sequence of the targeted protein on SARS\u2010COV\u20102 was collected from the National Centre for Biotechnological Information (NCBI) database.11 The protein sequence is very crucial for identifying the potential epitopes of the targeted protein.\n2.2 Identification of B\u2010cell epitopes\nIn this subsection, we used the Immune Epitope Database (IEDB) to identify linear B\u2010cell epitopes using the incorporated BepiPred 2.0 prediction module.12, 13 We provided the FASTA sequence of the targeted protein as an input considering all default parameters.\n2.3 Identification of T\u2010cell epitopes and antigenicity analysis\nT\u2010cell epitopes having the binding affinity towards MHC\u2010I and MHC\u2010II alleles were selected to boost up both cytotoxic T\u2010cell and helper T\u2010cell mediated immune response. We adopted two servers which are ProPred\u2010I and ProPred server to the selection of MHC\u2010I and MHC\u2010II binding epitopes respectively within preidentified B\u2010cell epitopic region.14, 15 The selected epitopes were submitted to the VaxiJen v.2.0 server applying a virus as a target field with the given threshold value of 0.4 for analyzing the antigenic propensity.16\n2.4 Vaccine construction, modeling, and validation\nWith the help of a specific peptide linker, we fused the antigenic epitopes to construct an effectual vaccine component. Later, the vaccine component was modeled in the SPARKS\u2010X server.17 An adjuvant was also added with the vaccine component to accelerate the adaptive immune responses. The vaccine model passed through two different servers ProSA\u2010web and PROCHECK\u2014in a subsequent manner for evaluating the structural accuracy of the model.18, 19\n2.5 Molecular docking analysis\nMolecular docking is the most promising part of the modern drug\u2010discovery method. Here, in this study, we adopted PatchDock (Beta 1.3 Version) docking server to receptor\u2010ligand docking.20 PatchDock server analyzes the molecular docking between the vaccine component and the toll\u2010like receptor (TLR)\u20105. The generated Protein Data Bank (PDB) file of the protein\u2010peptide docking complex was visualized in PyMOL software v.2.3.213 RESULT\n3.1 Collection of targeted protein sequence\nSpike glycoprotein of SARS\u2010COV\u20102, retrieved from the NCBI has the GenBank accession ID: QHR63290.1. This spike glycoprotein has 1282\u2010long amino acid sequences and this sequence was downloaded in a FASTA format to carry out the further process.\n3.2 Identification of B\u2010cell epitopes\nWe obtained a total of 34 sequential linear B\u2010cell epitopes of varying lengths from the IEDB server within spike glycoprotein of SARS\u2010COV\u20102. Those B\u2010cell epitopes were placed into Table 1 based on their positional value, sequence, and length. In Figure 1 the yellow\u2010colored peaks represent the epitopic region, while the green\u2010colored slopes, represent the nonepitopic region.\nTable 1.

This linker peptide was easily fused with the virus coat protein and increased stability as well as folding of the vaccine component.22 The predicted structure of the vaccine component is shown in Figure 2. It has 90.0%, 7.1%, 1.6%, and 1.3% residues in most favored, additionally allowed, generously allowed and disallowed regions respectively within PROCHECK as the validation server to generate Ramachandran plot. Using the ProSA server, the \u201cZ\u201d score was \u22123.82 and most of the residues had negative energy value as shown in Figure 3. Results from both servers indicate the model is in a good quality.23, 24\nFigure 2\nOpen in figure viewerPowerPoint\nTertiary structural model of construct vaccine component\nFigure 3\nOpen in figure viewerPowerPoint\nDifferent molecular characterization of vaccine model.

The ACE value of the docking complex was \u2212259.62, which indicates spontaneous reactivity between the vaccine component and TLR\u20105.25 As proper protein\u2010protein docking regulates the cellular functions, the docking between the vaccine component and TLR\u20105 will activate immune cascades for destroying the viral antigens.26 The selected docking complex is shown in Figures 4 and 5, along with molecular surface interaction as well as some bonding interactions.\nFigure 4\nOpen in figure viewerPowerPoint\nDocking complex exhibiting the surface interaction between vaccine component (cyan color) and toll\u2010like receptor\u20105 (green color)\nFigure 5\nOpen in figure viewerPowerPoint\nDocking complex exhibiting the bonding interaction between vaccine component and toll\u2010like receptor\u201054 DISCUSSION\nThe SARS\u2010COV\u20102, the causative pathogen for respiratory distress syndrome, led more than 10\u2009000 people to infection all over the world, even several to death. After first identified in Wuhan, Hubei province of China, the COVID\u201019 disease spread unchecked which finally became a global threat. Scientists from all over the world are struggling to find a solution to this evil outbreak.\nIn our present study, we attempted to find out various B\u2010cell and T\u2010cell epitopes against SARS\u2010COV\u20102, using the immunoinformatics, as quick identification of B\u2010cell and T\u2010cell epitopes is crucial for designing of vaccine component against this disease. The spike glycoprotein was analyzed for B\u2010cell epitope identification in the IEDB server, and 34 linear B\u2010cell epitopes were identified as a result. Subsequently, the sequence was also analyzed in ProPred\u2010I and ProPred servers for the identification of the T\u2010cell epitope that can combine with MHC\u2010I and MHC\u2010II molecules. Fortunately, we found 29 epitopes against MHC\u2010I and 8 epitopes against MHC\u2010II that can be possibly used for vaccine. Unfortunately, antigenic characterization in VaxiJen v.2.0 discarded 16 MHC\u2010I epitopes out of 29 and 5 out of 8 MHC\u2010II epitopes as these seemed to be nonantigenic in nature. Nevertheless, we converted the antigenic epitopes into a single vaccine component, using (EAAAK)3 peptide linker.\nLater, the vaccine component was modeled in the SPARK\u2010X server and validated in PROCHECK and ProSA. A total of 90% of nonglycine and nonproline residues presented within the most favored region, while the \u201cZ\u201d score of the model was \u22123.82. These results from both servers indicate the model is in good quality. Molecular docking between vaccine component and TLR\u20105 showed significant ACE value, which indicates spontaneous reactivity within the receptor\u2010ligand complex.\nAll the observations of our present work depict the effectiveness of selected epitopes within the spike glycoprotein of SARS\u2010COV\u20102. These epitopes can be used to make an immunogenic multi\u2010epitopic peptide vaccine against SARS\u2010COV\u20102.5 CONCLUSION\nPresent immunoinformatic analysis pointed out 13 MHC\u2010I and 3 MHC\u2010II epitopes within the spike glycoprotein of SARS\u2010COV\u20102. These epitopes are the ideal candidate to formulate a multi\u2010epitopic peptide vaccine, not only because of being selected from the linear B\u2010cell epitopic region but also because of their antigenic property was confirmed. Moreover, the molecular docking of vaccine components with the TLR\u20105 proves the significance and effectiveness of these epitopes as an ideal vaccine candidate against SARS\u2010COV\u20102. However, these immunoinformatic analyses require several in vitro and in vivo validations before formulating the vaccine to resist COVID\u201019.ACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThis study was supported by Hallym University Research Fund and by Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) funded by the Ministry of Education (NRF\u20102017R1A2B4012944).", "25735": "Objective\nWe aim to summarize reliable evidence of evidence\u2010based medicine for the treatment and prevention of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS\u2010CoV\u20102) by analyzing all the published studies on the clinical characteristics of patients with SARS\u2010CoV\u20102.Methods\nPubMed, Cochrane Library, Embase, and other databases were searched. Several studies on the clinical characteristics of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection were collected for meta\u2010analysis.Results\nTen studies were included in Meta\u2010analysis, including a total number of 50466 patients with SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection. Meta\u2010analysis shows that, among these patients, the incidence of fever was 0.891 (95% CI: 0.818, 0.945), the incidence of cough was 0.722 (95% CI: 0.657, 0.782), and the incidence of muscle soreness or fatigue was 0.425 (95% CI: 0.213, 0.652). The incidence of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) was 0.148 (95% CI: 0.046, 0.296), the incidence of abnormal chest computer tomography (CT) was 0.966 (95% CI: 0.921, 0.993), the percentage of severe cases in all infected cases was 0.181 (95% CI: 0.127, 0.243), and the case fatality rate of patients with SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection was 0.043 (95% CI: 0.027, 0.061).Conclusion\nFever and cough are the most common symptoms in patients with SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection, and most of these patients have abnormal chest CT examination. Several people have muscle soreness or fatigue as well as ARDS. Diarrhea, hemoptysis, headache, sore throat, shock, and other symptoms are rare. The case fatality rate of patients with SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection is lower than that of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS). This meta\u2010analysis also has limitations, so the conclusions of this Meta\u2010analysis still need to be verified by more relevant studies with more careful design, more rigorous execution, and larger sample size.1 INTRODUCTION\nSince December 2019, the epidemic of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS\u2010CoV\u20102) infectious pneumonia in Wuhan, China. The Chinese government and researchers have taken rapid measures to control the epidemic.1 On January 30 2020, WHO declared that the epidemic of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 was a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC). At present, the number of patients with SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection is still rising, and its harm to human beings has exceeded the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in China, 2002.2 The clinical characteristics and the case fatality rate after SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection have always been concerned by people, and it is also the focus of medical workers' research at present. However, due to the different design of different clinical studies and insufficient sample size, the conclusions of the published studies were different. To acquire more accurate conclusions on the clinical characteristics and mortality of patients with SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection, we searched the relevant literatures and carried out single\u2010arm meta\u2010analysis.3 Our findings provide important guidance for current clinical work on the prevention and treatment of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection.2 MATERIAL AND METHODS\n2.1 Search strategy\nThree popular medical databases including PubMed, Cochrane Library, and Embase databases were searched for related literature, using the following keywords: \u201c2019\u2010nCoV,\u201d \u201cCoronavirus,\u201d \u201cCOVID\u201019,\u201d \u201cSARS\u2010CoV\u20102,\u201d and \u201cWuhan Coronavirus.\u201d Articles reviewed were dated up to February 24, 2020. In this meta\u2010analysis, there was no language restriction. Only available data from published articles were collected. Data from unpublished papers were not included.\n2.2 The inclusive and exclusive criteria\n2.2.1 Inclusive criteria\nStudies that include randomized controlled trials, nonrandomized controlled trials, case\u2010control studies, cohort studies, cross\u2010sectional studies, and also case reports on the clinical characteristics of patients with SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection. Clinical characteristics of patients with SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection include fever (temperature\u2009\u2265\u200937.3\u00b0C), cough, muscle soreness or fatigue, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), abnormal chest computer tomography (CT) detection, patients in critical condition (severe cases are those who need to be sent to the intensive care unit (ICU) for treatment), as well as death due to SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection.\n2.2.2 Exclusive criteria\nArticles were published repeatedly; studies did not include the research indicators needed for meta\u2010analysis; research data were missing.\n2.3 Data extraction and paper quality evaluation\nFirst of all, we screened the literature according to the literature abstract, excluding the articles that obviously do not meet the inclusive criteria, and then read the full article for rescreening. If any disagreement on the choice of the literature exists, a third evaluator will join to make the decision. All included literature were evaluated using the Newcastle\u2010Ottawa Scale (NOS).4 The highest quality of the literature was 9 stars and the lowest 0 stars.\n2.4 Statistical analysis\nThe statistical software Stata version 12.0 was used to carry out the single\u2010arm meta\u2010analysis. In order to reduce the influence of heterogeneity between the included studies on final conclusion, we used the random effects model for meta\u2010analysis. Original data included in the literature were first transformed by double arcsine method to make them conform to the normal distribution and then analyzed in Stata. The initial conclusion obtained by meta\u2010analysis was then restored using formula (P\u2009=\u2009(sin(tp/2))2) to reach final conclusion. To objectively evaluate the publication bias of the included literature, the Egger test with P\u2009<\u2009.05 as the existence of publication bias was performed, the values larger than which were considered as no publication bias.3 RESULTS\n3.1 Literature inclusion\nA total of 284 articles were retrieved, among which 39 papers were removed due to repeated retrieval, 212 papers were removed after reading abstracts, and 23 were eliminated after reading the full text. At the end, a total of 10 articles5-14 were included in this meta\u2010analysis, including data from 50\u2009466 patients. The specific operation flow is shown in Figure 1.

It causes the third kind of zoonotic coronavirus disease after SARS and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). Wei Ji et al15 found that SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 seemed to be a recombinant virus between bat coronavirus and coronavirus of another unknown origin. Xiao et al16 confirmed that Malayan pangolins were the most likely intermediate host of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102. The research of Benvenuto et al17 found that SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 was only closely related to the coronavirus isolated from the chrysanthemum\u2010headed bat in 2015. Their research suggests that bats may be the reservoir host for SARS\u2010CoV\u20102. According to the research by Zhou et al18 and Wu et al,19 it was found that the sequence homology between SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 and SARS\u2010CoV was 79.5%. The homology between SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 and bat coronavirus at the genetic level was 96%. Therefore, very likely it can be confirmed that SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 comes from bats.\nAccording to the results of meta\u2010analysis, we find that the incidence of fever was 89.1%, the incidence of cough was 72.2%, and the incidence of muscle soreness or fatigue was 42.5%. The incidence of ARDS was 14.8%, the incidence of abnormal CT was 96.6%, the percentage of severe cases in all infected cases was 18.1%, and the case fatality rate of patients with SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection was 4.3%. Weijie Guan et al.8 found that the common patterns on chest CT were ground\u2010glass opacity and bilateral patchy shadowing in patients with SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection. Chaolin Huang et al.5 found that the typical chest CT images of severe cases were bilateral multiple lobular and subsegmental areas of consolidation. In addition, by reading the included literature,5-14 we found that diarrhea, hemoptysis, headache, sore throat, shock, and other symptoms are rare.\nAt present, the Chinese government has announced that the case fatality rate of patients with SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection in China is 3.8%, which is lower than that of another two widely contagious zoonotic coronavirus diseases, SARS and MERS. Infection mortality rates of SARS and MERS are 9.6%20 and 35%,21 respectively. Since the case fatality rate of patients with SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection is low, a large number of patients with SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection will be cured. Sheng et al22 have shown that viral infection could increase the risk of pulmonary fibrosis. Xie et al23 found that 45% of patients showed signs of pulmonary fibrosis within 1 month after being infected with SARS\u2010CoV. Hui24 revealed that 36% and 30% of patients infected with SARS\u2010CoV developed pulmonary fibrosis 3 and 6 months after infection. These studies consistently suggest that pulmonary fibrosis will become one of the serious complications in patients with SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection. How to prevent and reduce the occurrence of pulmonary fibrosis in patients with SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection are urgent problems for medical workers in the treatment of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102.\nZhao et al25 found that angiotensin\u2010converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) was the receptor of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102. In normal lung tissue, ACE2 is mainly expressed by type I and type II alveolar epithelial cells. It was reported that 83% of II type alveolar cells expressed ACE2. Therefore, SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection causes damages to most II type alveolar cells. In addition, the use of mechanical ventilation in the treatment of patients with SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection can also aggravate the injury of alveolar cells. After alveolar cell injury, transforming growth factor\u2010\u03b2 (TGF\u2010 \u03b2) released in tissue promotes lung repair. Virus infection often leads to excessive activation of TGF\u2010\u03b2 pathway, which leads to the occurrence of pulmonary fibrosis.\nBased on the mechanism of pulmonary fibrosis after virus infection, we can formulate corresponding prevention and treatment proposals. The first is the treatment of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection. At present, a variety of drugs have been found to inhibit SARS\u2010CoV\u20102. Holshue et al26 achieved remarkable results in the treatment of patients with SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection with remdesivir. This drug is currently in clinical trials. Second, it is necessary to inhibit the inflammatory reaction and reduce exudation. In this direction, antibiotics not only have traditional antibacterial effects but also have immunomodulatory and anti\u2010inflammatory properties.27 Macrolide antibiotics such as clarithromycin, azithromycin, and erythromycin prevent the production of proinflammatory cytokines and immune mediators.28 The third is to inhibit the fibrogenic effect of TGF\u2010\u03b2. Luo et al29 found that arsenic trioxide could inhibit the signal transduction of TGF\u2010\u03b2 and play a role in antifibrosis. The fourth is the rational use of ventilator to avoid unnecessary lung damages. In addition, pirfenidone and nintedanib as drugs for the treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis can also be used to prevent and treat pulmonary fibrosis in patients with SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection.30\nIn all, a total of 10 articles were covered in the meta\u2010analysis, including 50\u2009466 patients with SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection. By far, it is the first meta\u2010analysis with the largest sample size. The quality of the literature included in this study is high, the analysis is rigorous, and the conclusions drawn by the study are highly credible. However, this meta\u2010analysis also has some limitations: (a) all studies included in this meta\u2010analysis are retrospective studies with large heterogeneity; (b) most patients in our meta\u2010analysis are Chinese, and we aimed to use the conclusions of this study to predict patients in general, including other countries and races; (c) there was publication bias in the meta\u2010analysis of the ARDS group. The analytical conclusion of the ARDS group may be influenced by publication bias; and (d) the study subjects were inpatients who have been diagnosed with SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection. So, the incidence of severe pneumonia or the fatality rate in the total population infected with SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 would be much lower than the results shown in this study.\nTherefore, based on the above\u2010mentioned limitations, the conclusions of this meta\u2010analysis still need to be verified by more relevant studies with more careful design, more rigorous execution, and larger sample size.ACKNOWLEDGMENT\nWe would like to acknowledge TopEdit LLC for the linguistic editing and proofreading during the preparation of this manuscript.CONFLICT OF INTERESTS\nThe authors declare that there are no conflict of interests.AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS\nJX and PS developed the idea for and designed the study and had full access to all data in the study and take responsibility for the integrity of the data and the accuracy of the data analysis.

At the time of writing, 14\u2009441 cases of 2019\u2010nCoV\u2010related pneumonia cases have been reported in China, plus 118 cases from 23 other countries. There are currently 315 deaths linked to this pathogen (source: World Health Organization report, 02 February 2020). Phylogenetic relationships between Bat and Human coronaviridae have been discovered for SARS3 and more recently also for 2019\u2010nCoV,4 suggesting events of inter\u2010species transmissions.5\nNo vaccine for 2019\u2010nCoV has been publicly released, but a World effort has arisen toward the characterization of the molecular determinants and evolutionary features of this novel virus. An initial comparison of 10 genomic sequences from 2019\u2010nCoV specimens has reported a low heterogeneity of this viruses with intersample sequence identity above 99.9%.6 There are currently 54 2019\u2010nCoV complete genome sequences from the Global Initiative for Sharing all Influenza Data (Gisaid7) and from GenBank,8 plus two partial sequences obtained by the Spallanzani hospital in Rome, Italy (also from Gisaid).\nIn this short report, we set out to characterize the heterogeneity of all 2019\u2010nCoV genomes and proteomes available at the moment of the study, comparing them to other representative coronaviridae, specifically SARS, MERS, and BCoV. We will generate phylogenetic trees of the 2019\u2010nCoV cases and apply entropy\u2010based analyses of position\u2010wise variance and categorical principal component analysis (CATPCA) as an alternative method to estimate the sequence distance between all analyzed viruses.2 METHODS\nAll genomic sequences were collected on 02 February 2020 from GenBank8 or Gisaid.7\nMSA was performed using MUSCLE v3.8.31.9\nMSA visualization was generated via Jalview v 2.11.0.10\nPhylogenetic model generation and tree visualization were done using MEGAX v 10.1.7,11 using the Maximum Likelihood method and Tamura\u2010Nei model.12 The tree structure was validated by running the analysis on 100 bootstrapped input datasets.13\nCATPCA was performed on R version 3.6.1 using the package FactoMineR.14 Specifically, an MSA FASTA file from MUSCLE is loaded in R and converted into a categorical matrix, with genomes as rows and nucleotide coordinates as columns. Factors are defined as A, C, G, T, N, or\u2014(gap), as described in results. Then, the FactoMineR multiple correspondence analysis algorithms is run with default parameters and custom R functions are used to plot the component values for each genome.\nPairwise protein identity and coverage were calculated using BLAST protein v2.6.015 with BLOSUM62 matrix and default parameters. Nucleotide sequence identity and coverage were calculated using BLAST nucleotide v2.6.0.15\nPrediction of structural protein disorder was performed using GLOBPLOT2, an implementation of the Russell/Linding algorithm.163 RESULTS\n3.1 Phylogenetic analysis\nWe collected 53 full genomic 2019\u2010nCoV sequences from the Gisaid database (Table S1), plus the GenBank\u2010deposited sequence from the Wuhan seafood market pneumonia virus isolate Wuhan\u2010Hu\u20101 (NC_045512.2) and two partial sequences from Italian isolates (EPI_ISL_406959 and EPI_ISL_406960). To compare 2019\u2010nCoVs with closely related viral species, we obtained six sequences from distinct human SARS genomes from GenBank (the reference NC_004718.3, plus the genomes AY274119.3, GU553363.1, DQ182595.1, AY297028.1, and AY515512.1). We also obtained six BCoV genomic sequences (DQ022305.2, DQ648857.1, JX993987.1, KJ473816.1, MG772934.1, EPI_ISL_402131). Finally, as more distantly related beta\u2010CoVs we analyzed also MERS genomes from GenBank entries JX869059.2 and KT368829.1.\nSimilarly to a previous report with 10 virus specimens,6 we detected very high conservation between the 56 analyzed 2019\u2010nCoV genomes, with sequence identity above 99%. We found a bat CoV genome (Gisaid EPI_ISL_402131) with 96.2% sequence identity (and query coverage above 99%) to the 2019\u2010nCoV reference sequence (NC_045512.2), while the previously reported closest bat CoV (bat\u2010SL\u2010CoVZC45) has a sequence similarity of 88%.6 The reference human SARS genome (NC_004718.3) appears more distant from the reference 2019\u2010nCoV, with sequence identity of 80.26% and query coverage of 98%.\nWe aligned all the 70 coronavirus sequences using MUSCLE9 and inferred the evolutionary relationships between these sequences with a Tamura\u2010Nei Maximum Likelihood estimation12 with 100 bootstraps for model robustness estimation.\nThe results are shown in Figure 1 as a phylogenetic tree representation. All the human 2019\u2010nCoV appear very similar to each other, despite the different locations of sampling. Bat coronaviridae appears to be the closet homologs. Two specific specimens gathered in 2013 and 2015 in China from the bat species Rhinolophus affinis and Rhinolophus sinicus appear to be located between the BCoV and the human 2019\u2010nCoV groups, supporting the notion of a zoonotic transfer from bats to humans.4 Human SARS sequences group with BCoV sequences more distantly related to 2019\u2010nCoV genomes. Finally, MERS genomes are the most genetically distinct amongst the other sequences.\nFigure 1\nOpen in figure viewerPowerPoint\nPhylogenetic tree of all the 2019\u2010nCov sequences available at 02\u2010Feb\u20102020 (branches shown in blue), plus six Bat coronavirus sequences (default black, as they are split in multiple taxa), six human SARS (green) and two MERS (orange). The percentage of bootstraps supporting each branch is reported. Branches corresponding to partitions reproduced in less than 50% bootstrap replicates are collapsed. MERS, Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome; SARS, severe acute respiratory syndrome\nA purely topological representation of a bootstrapped Maximum Likelihood tree (Figure S1) shows that 2019\u2010nCoV sequences are highly similar to each other, with poor support to the existence of distinct subgroups.\nThe global multiple sequence alignment (MSA) is available as Supporting Information File S1.\n3.2 Genomic divergence from other beta\u2010coronaviridae\nGiven the high homogeneity between 2019\u2010nCoV genomes, we developed a novel method to classify genomic sequences, based on CATPCA.14 Briefly, this analysis finds the eigenvectors describing the highest variance within a categorical dataset, like ours. Our dataset derived from the MUSCLE MSA of 70 genomes and generated 32\u2009206 positions: the categories in each coordinate could be A (Adenine), C (Cytosine), G (Guanine; T [Thymine], although being an single strand RNA virus, it would be more appropriate to use U [Uracil]), N (Nucleotide, uncertain location: very rare in this dataset, and accounting for only nine positions, or 0.0004% of all the data).\nOur analysis shows similar results for phylogenetic tree representations. In Figure 2A, we show the catPCA of the first components for all analyzed genomes. The MERS/non\u2010MERS grouping accounts for the largest variance, while SARS and SARS\u2010like BCoVs cluster together. While 2019\u2010nCoV constitute a tightly similar cluster, the two bat virus sequences MG772934.1 and EPI_ISL_402131 appear to be linking the human 2019\u2010nCoV to the Bat coronaviridae.\nFigure 2\nOpen in figure viewerPowerPoint\nCategorical principal component analysis of the projected variance in the entire coronaviridae genome dataset considered in this study (A) and in the 2019\u2010nCoV subset only (B). Human 2019\u2010nCoV are shown as blue circles, other genomes as grey diamonds\nA catPCA analysis on the sole 2019\u2010nCoV sequences highlights some internal variability (Figure 2B), with two likely outliers identified in the genome EPI_ISL_406862 (collected in Germany) and EPI_ISL_406592 (collected in Shenzhen, China).\n3.3 Genomic variance estimation within 2019\u2010nCoV genomes\nAlthough the variability within the 2019\u2010nCoV genomes is very low, we set out to discover possible hotspots of hypervariability within the viral population. We analyzed the approximately 30\u2009000\u2009nt of multiple genome alignments performed on the 54 full 2019\u2010nCoV genomes. Our analysis shows that these viruses have largely the same genomic arrangement as the SARS species.17 A large gene encoding for a polyprotein (ORF1ab) at the 5\u2032 end of the genome is followed by four major structural protein\u2010coding genes: S\u2009=\u2009Spike protein, E\u2009=\u2009Envelope protein, M\u2009=\u2009Membrane protein, and N\u2009=\u2009Nucleocapsid protein. There are also at least six other accessory open reading frames (ORFs) (Figure 3A).\nFigure 3\nOpen in figure viewerPowerPoint\nVariability within 54 2019\u2010nCoV full genomic sequences. A, location of major structural protein\u2010encoding genes (red boxes; S\u2009=\u2009Spike protein, E\u2009=\u2009Envelope protein, M\u2009=\u2009Membrane protein, N\u2009=\u2009Nucleocapsid protein) and accessory protein ORFs (blue boxes) on the meta\u2010genomic sequence derived from the MSA of all genomes. B, Shannon entropy values across genomic locations. The two coordinates with the highest entropy (excluding the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 highly variable UnTranslated regions) are indicated. C, Zoom\u2010in of the MSA describing the two most variable locations in the core genome, in the ORF1ab (left) and in ORF8 (right). MSA, multiple sequence alignment\nFor each position of the multialigned 54 2019\u2010nCoV, we calculated Shannon Entropy as a measure of the position variability.18 Apart from the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 ends, likely nonprotein coding and less homogeneous, we identified two hotspots of hypervariability at positions 8789 and 28151 (Figure 3B,C).\nPosition 8789 witnesses the presence of either T (U) or C, and it falls within the polyprotein gene. It causes a synonymous variation in the nucleotide triplet encoding for Serine 2839 (amino acid coordinates based on the reference genome NC_045512.2), so it is likely not to introduce phenotypical differences between the different strains.\nOn the other hand, position 28151 falls within ORF8 and is characterized by the presence of either a C or a U. This causes a Ser/Leu change in amino acid (aa) 84, which can affect the conformation of the peptide, given that Serine is a polar amino acid, and Leucine is nonpolar. Aa84 appears to be nonconserved also across other coronaviridae (Figure 4A, black arrow).\nFigure 4\nOpen in figure viewerPowerPoint\nA, MSA of the coronavirus proteins encoded by ORF8 in representative sequences for the 2019\u2010nCoV (Wuhan), BCoVs (Bat SARS\u2010like and Bat SARS) and SARS viruses. B, Alignment of ORF8\u2010L and ORF8\u2010S, two isoforms varying at amino acid position 84 (indicated by a red dot). The diagram shows in larger blue the Globplot\u2010predicted intrinsically disordered regions in the two isoforms. C, MSA of the coronavirus Nucleocapside proteins. MSA, multiple sequence alignment\nWe analyzed the alternative isoforms of 2019\u2010nCoV ORF8\u2010aa84 alternative isoforms, dubbed ORF8\u2010L (Leucine) and ORF8\u2010S (Serine). Unfortunately, no crystal structures of close homologs to the ORF8 protein are available for a reliable homology modeling to measure the structural impact of this amino acid substitution. The closest 3D model to 2019\u2010nCoV ORF8 available in Protein Data Bank19 is a short 22 amino acid stretch in the protein entry 6P65, with a nonsignificant E\u2010value of 0.848. We, therefore, employed de novo methods to infer the structural features of ORF8. One important effect we could detect is a significant effect of Serine in ORF8\u2010S in inducing structural disorder in the protein C\u2010terminal portion, which is not predicted to be present in the ORF8\u2010L (Figure 4B), using the Russell/Linding algorithm.16 Moreover, it did not escape our attention that the ORF8\u2010S could theoretically generate a novel phosphorylation target for the mammalian host Serine/Threonine kinases of the host organism. So, we searched for ORF8 homologous substrates in the Mammalia NCBI nr protein database, but could not find matches within the E\u2010value threshold of 1.\n3.4 Protein conservation within 2019\u2010nCoV and between other beta\u2010coronaviridae\nWe performed a cross\u2010species analysis for all proteins encoded by the 2019\u2010nCoV and its relatives. We, therefore, analyzed the protein sequences encoded by all ORFs in these genomes\nWuhan NC_045512.2 (GenBank reference genome for 2019\u2010nCoV)\nBCoV bat\u2010SL\u2010CoVZXC21 MG772934.1 (Bat virus similar to 2019\u2010nCoV)\nBat SARS coronavirus HKU3\u20101 DQ022305.2 (Bat virus more distantly related to 2019\u2010nCoV)\nSARS NC_004718.3 (GenBank reference genome for SARS)\nOur analysis shows a close homology for all proteins with Bat sequence MG772934.1 (>80%), and more distant with the other Bat sequence and SARS reference. Query (2019\u2010nCoV) coverage was always above 99.0%. Generally, we could observe high conservation for structural proteins E, M, and A across the beta\u2010coronavirus family, while accessory proteins (especially ORF8) seem to have much stricter evolutionary constraints (Table 1).\nTable 1. Percentage identity between the human reference nCoV proteins and other coronavirus representatives\nGene Bat MG772934.1 Bat DQ022305.2 SARS NC_004718.3\nORF1ab (polyprotein) 95.15% 85.78% 86.12%\nS (Spike) 80.32% 76.04% 75.96%\nOrf3a 92.00% 72.99% 72.36%\nE (Envelope) 100% 94.74% 94.74%\nM (Membrane) 98.65% 90.99% 90.54%\nORF6 93.44% 67.21% 68.85%\nORF7a 88.43% 88.52% 85.25%\nORF7b 93.02% 79.07% 81.40%\nORF8 94.21% 57.02% 30.16%\nN (Nucleocapsid) 94.27% 89.55% 90.52%\nORF10 73.20% 74.23% 72.45%\nOn average, nCoV shares 91.1% of protein sequences with Bat virus MG772934.1, 79.7% with Bat virus DQ022305.2%, and 77.1% with the SARS proteome.\nFor further visual confirmation, via MSA, of the conservation between SARS and 2019\u2010nCoV, especially in structural proteins, please refer also to Figure 4C and Figures S2 and S3. As previously observed, the N protein in 2019\u2010nCoV differs from the SARS ortholog in the structurally relevant amino acids 380 and 410.44 DISCUSSION\nOur results highlight a high level of conservation within 2019\u2010nCoV genomes sequenced so far, and a clear origin from other beta\u2010CoVs, specifically BCoVs, SARS and MERS. Our analysis confirms previous results highlighting the BCoV as a likely evolutionary link between the SARS viruses and the current epidemic 2019\u2010nCoV.4 We could confirm this result both with standard phylogenetic analysis and a newly developed visualization method for genomic distances, based on CATPCA.\nThe similarity between 2019\u2010nCoV and the closest Bat relative is very high: all proteins in the coronavirus proteome (with the exception of ORF10) have identities of above 85%, with full conservation of the genome length (~30\u2009kb). We could report also the specific amino acids that changed between SARS and nCoV, with potential implications in epitope definition and possible repurposing of anti\u2010SARS drugs and vaccines.\nOur analysis found low variability (>99% sequence identity) within the 56 2019\u2010nCoV genomes available at the time of writing, with only two core positions of high variability, one a silent variant in the ORF1ab locus, and the other as an amino acid polymorphism in ORF8. The mutation in ORF8 resulting in one of its two variants, ORF8\u2010L and ORF8\u2010S, is predicted to be affecting the structural disorder of the protein. Specifically, the amino acidic region aa83\u2010aa89 is more likely to be disordered in the ORF8\u2010S isoform.\nIn conclusion, our analysis confirms low variability within the new epidemic virus 2019\u2010nCoV sequenced specimens, while highlighting at least two nucleotide positions of higher variability within protein\u2010coding regions, and specific amino acid divergences compared to BCoVs and SARS.4 These findings shed a cautiously optimistic light on the possibility of finding effective treatment for this novel coronavirus, starting from already existing anti\u2010beta\u2010coronaviridae compounds,20 which will be dealing with a relatively homogenous viral population.ACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nWe would like to thank the Italian Ministry of University and Research for funding.

More seriously, the epidemic continued to spread from China to Europe, North America, and other Asian countries, despite great efforts and an increasing number of people being cured in China. The World Health Organization (WHO) announced the severe acute respiratory syndrome\u2010related coronavirus 2 (SARS\u2010CoV\u20102) epidemic as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) on 30 January 2020, and raised the risk assessment of COVID\u201019 from \"high\" to \"very high\" at the global level on 28 February 2020.2 The threat of global pandemics is real.3\nFigure 1\nOpen in figure viewerPowerPoint\nThe existing confirmed and suspected number of cases of coronavirus disease 2019 in China. On 17 February 2020, the total number of existing cases reached its peak and declined gradually. As of 2 March 2020, the total number of confirmed cases and deaths reached 80\u2009174 and 2915, respectively\nFigure 2\nOpen in figure viewerPowerPoint\nThe new confirmed cases outside of China started to increase gradually after 21 February. PHEIC, Public Health Emergency of International Concern; WHO, World Health Organization\nFigure 3\nOpen in figure viewerPowerPoint\nThe confirmed cases outside of China. PHEIC, Public Health Emergency of International Concern; WHO, World Health Organization\nYang et al4 reported 52 critically ill adult patients with COVID\u201019 who could not survive the disease on 21 February 2020, most of whom faced organ function damage and needed extracorporeal support. Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University reported 138 hospitalized patients with COVID\u201019; most of these patients received antiviral therapy (oseltamivir, 124 [89.9%]), glucocorticoid therapy (62 [44.9%]), and 36 patients (26.1%) were transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU). Of the 36 cases in the ICU, 15 (41.7%) received noninvasive ventilation and 17 (47.2%) received invasive ventilation (four were switched to extracorporeal membrane oxygenation [ECMO]).5 The China Medical Treatment Expert Group for SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 reported that 55 (5.00%) of 1099 laboratory\u2010confirmed patients were admitted to the ICU and 15 (1.36%) succumbed. Severe pneumonia was independently associated with admission to the ICU, mechanical ventilation, or death.6\nTo reduce the case\u2010fatality rate and complication rate without registered treatment or a vaccine, there is an urgent need for health care workers worldwide to review and propose experience and lessons from critical COVID\u201019 patients in a timely manner. Given the treatments mentioned above, we will discuss antiviral therapy, glucocorticoid therapy, and extracorporeal support, including ECMO and artificial liver system (ALS) available for the treatment of COVID\u201019 based on current published evidence. Furthermore, we list a table to conclude the mechanism, advantages, and limitations for different treatments mentioned in this review (Table 2).2 ANTIVIRAL THERAPY\n2.1 Remdesivir\nRemdesivir (GS\u20105734) has broad\u2010spectrum activities against viruses such as Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and SARS in both cell and animal trials.7-10 In addition, research revealed that remdesivir could inhibit viral infection effectively in a human cell line (human liver cancer Huh\u20107 cells), which is susceptible to SARS\u2010CoV\u20102.11\nThe mechanism of remdesivir against the virus showed that the drug effectively inhibited the Ebola virus RNA\u2010dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) complex.12, 13 The remdesivir could form remdesivir triphosphate (remdesivir\u2010TP) in vivo, which was incorporated into the newly synthesized RNA chain of the virus as the substrate of the virus RdRp, thereby interrupting the transcription of the virus.12 Another study showed that remdesivir\u2010TP could compete with adenosine triphosphate (ATP).14 After entering the cells, a monophosphoramidate prodrug of remdesivir transformed into triphosphate metabolite (NTP) in three steps, and NTP and ATP competed to bind viral RdRp. NTP was incorporated into the RNA synthesis chain, contributing to the termination of viral RNA synthesis and inhibiting RdRp enzyme activity.12\nIn addition, remdesivir was used against a case of 2019 novel coronavirus, reported in N Engl J Med, leading to widespread interest.15 In this case report, a patient with COVID\u201019 was treated by intravenous remdesivir without apparent adverse reactions on the evening of the seventh day of hospitalization. The patient's clinical symptoms improved on the eighth day after hospitalization (the 12th day after onset).\nPhase III clinical trials of remdesivir had been completed for the treatment of Ebola virus infection with complete data on human pharmacokinetics and safety.16 Recently, phase III randomized controlled trials were carried out to evaluate intravenous remdesivir for COVID\u201019 (NCT04252664 and NCT04257656), which will be completed in April 2020 and May 2020, respectively.17, 18 Remdesivir (100\u2009mg except for the first day of 200\u2009mg) for 10 days with placebo in the phase III trials, which were initiated in China, is worthy of concern about adverse reactions at this dose due to differences in ethnicity.\n2.2 Ribavirin\nRibavirin is a broad\u2010spectrum nucleoside antiviral drug that is phosphorylated in virus\u2010infected cells, and its product acts as a competitive inhibitor of virus synthetase, interfering with early viral transcription events and hindering the synthesis of ribonucleoproteins, thereby hindering virus replication and spread.\nIn vitro, four studies observed antiviral effects against SARS,19-22 but the results from Cinatl et al23 and Stroher et al24 showed no evidence of an antiviral effect. Moreover, there was insufficient evidence of clinical effects after administration to SARS\u2010infected patients,25, 26 and its side effects, such as hemolytic anemia,26-29 were found to be relatively strong in clinical applications, which should be given close attention during treatment for COVID\u201019. In addition, in the case of ribavirin, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved its use for the treatment of human respiratory fusion virus,30 particularly certain hemorrhagic fever. The FDA clearly stated that ribavirin was not suitable for the treatment of influenza and had strict indications.\nDuring the COVID\u201019 epidemic, ribavirin was indicated for the general treatment of COVID\u201019 in Chinese treatment guidelines,31 and it is recommended that ribavirin is combined with interferon as antiviral therapy. According to cellular trials in SARS and MERS, reported by Morgenstern et al21 and Falzarano et al,32 the dosage of ribavirin can be reduced when combined with interferon due to their synergistic effect.3 CORONAVIRUS\u2010SPECIFIC TREATMENTS\n3.1 Chloroquine\nOverall, without domestic phase I and II clinical trials, ribavirin did not have statistical data on clinical safety and efficacy against syndrome\u2010related coronavirus 2 specifically. Thus, the clinical treatment of safety and ethical problems is worthy of attention.\nThe ability to interfere with virus infection and replication came from increasing the endosomal pH required for virus/cell fusion and immune\u2010modulating activity along with widespread distribution throughout the whole body (including the lungs) in vivo,11, 33 and Biot et al34 reported that chloroquine and its derivatives inhibit viral replication in vitro.\nAs a potent inhibitor of SARS\u2010CoV in cell culture, Keyaerts et al35 reported that the half\u2010maximal inhibitory concentration of chloroquine for antiviral activity was significantly lower than its cytostatic activity, which approximated that the plasma concentrations of chloroquine reached the level of acute malaria treatment even up to 5\u2009hours after infection against SARS\u2010CoV\u2010infected Vero E6 cells. Chloroquine could also interfere with angiotensin\u2010converting enzyme 2, one of the binding sites for S protein, to inhibit SARS\u2010CoV infection.36 In vitro, the experiment also highlighted that chloroquine blocked COVID\u201019 virus infection at low\u2010micromolar concentrations11 with the possible mechanism of interfering with terminal glycosylation of the cellular receptor, ACE2, to negatively influence virus\u2010receptor binding.37\nHowever, there are several limitations for further clinical application in patients. (a) Most of the current research has been limited to cell culture and the animal models, and potential adverse drug reactions, such as cardiotoxicity and irreversible retinopathy, should not be ignored.38 The contraindications, relative contraindications, and pharmaceutical precautions are listed in Table S1.39 (b) A more clinical experiment must be supported to explicate the antiviral effect in patients infected with COVID\u201019. (c) After chloroquine is taken by oral administration, most of it is metabolized in the liver. Since it is excreted slowly and maintained in plasma with a half\u2010life of 2.5 to 10 days, patients with liver dysfunction may be more likely to experience chloroquine accumulation in vivo. According to the Wuhan Institute of Virology, the lethal dose of chloroquine in adults is 2 to 4\u2009g, and it is acute. The expert consensus on chloroquine phosphate recommended that it was suitable for adults aged 18 to 65 with the dose depending on the weight of the patient (Table 1).38\nTable 1. Usage and dosage recommended by the National Health Commission of China\nWeight, kg Usage and dosage\nDays 1\u20102 Days 3\u20107\n\u226450 500\u2009mg each time, 2 times per day 500\u2009mg each time, 1 time per day\n>50 500\u2009mg each time, 2 times per day 500\u2009mg each time, 2 times per day\n3.2 Corticosteroids\nCorticosteroids have been widely used in the treatment of past coronavirus infections (such as SARS and MERS), and corticosteroids are also one of the methods for treating COVID\u201019.31, 4, 40, 41 However, no evidence was found on the antiviral effect of corticosteroids alone in resisting SARS\u2010CoV in vitro.25 In addition, interim guidance from the WHO on the clinical management of suspected COVID\u201019 advised avoiding the use of corticosteroids unless indicated for another reason, given lack of their effectiveness,42 because corticosteroids may cause harm (avascular necrosis,43 psychosis,44 diabetes,45 and delayed viral clearance46), as reported by some studies. Moreover, an article published by Russell et al47 recently in The Lancet does not recommend the use of corticosteroids in treating COVID\u201019. In addition, the study reported that 16 patients (44%) with arrhythmia among the 36 severe patients diagnosed with COVID\u201019,5 and another study showed that the proportion of acute cardiac injury in COVID\u201019 could reach 12%.40 Moreover, severe patients might have multiple organ dysfunction (MOD), such as shock, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), acute heart injury, acute kidney injury, and even death.40 MOD could be due to the cytokine storm, because the discovery that T cell excessive activation in pathologic examinations of COVID\u201019 with multiple organ failure by the team of Fu\u2010Sheng Wang48 and a similar cytokine storm reported by Huang et al.40 Hence, it was suggested to use appropriate corticosteroids for patients suffering from ARDS.49 Furthermore, pathological studies of COVID\u201019 observed pulmonary edema and hyaline membrane formation, implying that timely use of corticosteroids is necessary for severe patients,48 which was also supported by retrospective pathologic examinations showing edema, and proteinaceous exudate with globules in the lungs of two patients with COVID\u201019.504 SUPPORT THERAPY\n4.1 Artificial liver system\nThe ALS is one of an effective method for treating liver failure,51 and its treatment mechanism is based on liver cell regeneration ability. Through a extracorporeal equipment, ALS removes all kinds of harmful substances, supplements necessary material, improves the internal environment, and temporarily replaces part of liver function, to create good conditions for the regeneration of liver cells or while waiting for an opportunity for liver transplantation.52 Among the three types (nonbiological, biological, and hybrid) of artificial liver support systems, artificial extracorporeal liver support therapy has been widely used in acute liver failure and has been proven to improve survival.53 As mentioned above, cytokine storm was associated with disease severity reported by a study, which illustrated that GCSF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNF\u2010\u03b1 were found to be higher in patients who require ICU admission.40 Moreover, a retrospective study including 99 patients with COVID\u201019 showed that 17 patients suffered ARDS, and among them, 11 patients progressed rapidly and eventually died of multiple organ failure.49 In these death cases, timely treatment of critical cases is of vital significance.49 In China, Lan Juan Li initially treated severe patients with an ALS called Li\u2010ALS to eliminate inflammatory factors.54 Plasma exchange and continuous venovenous hemofiltration are the main components of the function of Li\u2010ALS, which is the treatment for severe patients with H7N9 virus infection when they worsen in a short period and a cytokine storm is detected.55, 56 In addition, potential complications such as hemorrhage, coagulation, hypotension, secondary infection, allergic reaction, disequilibrium syndrome and so on should be fully evaluated and prevented before ALS treatment is applied to any patient.52 Hence, once a cytokine storm was found in COVID\u201019, extracorporeal blood purification techniques, including ALS, can be considered if conditions permit (Table 2).\nTable 2.

It can partially replace myocardial function during the development of sepsis, improve peripheral perfusion and oxygenation, and provide an opportunity for primary disease treatment.59\nHowever, it is not a treatment for the virus, but a means of life support with many limitations. (a) Related accidents and complications may occur, including bleeding, infection, hemolysis, thrombosis, limb ischemia, multiple organ failure, and even life\u2010threatening complications in severe cases.59 Some complications are hard to avoid, and we should pay attention to prevention and early management to prevent the condition of patients with COVID\u201019 from detrimentally worsening. (b) Applying ECMO to each patient is costly due to the high manufacturing cost, high operation cost, and requirement for a specialist multidisciplinary team. (c) There are only approximately 400 ECMO devices in China, according to the People's Daily. Therefore, critically ill patients with no underlying disease would be preferred.5 CONCLUSION\nCoronavirus infection is a major public health problem worldwide and is mainly caused by respiratory infections including influenza and other acute respiratory viral diseases. It is estimated that lower respiratory infections cause more than four million deaths each year, approximately 40% of which are caused by respiratory viruses.60 Both MERS\u2010CoV and SARS\u2010CoV have been known to cause severe illness in people, and now an outbreak of COVID\u201019 has occurred.\nThis review will help understand the advantages and limitations of differential treatments. In this review, we summarize and discuss the controversial treatments that correspond to complications of critical COVID\u201019 patients. Without any specific antiviral treatments for SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 currently, some may be effective, while others are in clinical trials or are being investigated in vitro studies. Remdesivir has shown antiviral activity against MERS and SARS at the cellular level and in animal models, as well as anti\u2010SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 activity in vitro, and it can be used as a potential 2019 novel coronavirus drug. Ribavirin is a broad\u2010spectrum nucleoside antiviral drug; however, the clinical effects are unclear, and side effects should be considered. Regarding chloroquine, there were 15 interventional studies and its derivatives were prospectively registered in the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry; and further observations need to be evaluated regarding antiviral effect and recommended dose in patients infected with COVID\u201019. In addition to antiviral drugs, glucocorticoids should be used carefully and in a timely manner in patients with COVID\u201019. Extracorporeal support (ALS and ECMO) should be considered under strict indications and contraindications; otherwise, the waste of resources and additional complications will be enormous. ECMO may be used more aggressively and many more ECMO devices could be transferred to Hubei Province in the future due to the temporary absence of effective antiviral drugs and the hope of reducing mortality. In conclusion, antiviral therapy and organ function support are most effective in reducing the mortality rate in patients with mild syndrome and patients in critical condition, respectively.CONFLICT OF INTERESTS\nThe authors declare that there is no conflict of interests.", "25719": "1 INTRODUCTION\nA novel Coronavirus, the COVID\u20102019, first appeared in Wuhan, China, last December 2019, spreading in other provinces/regions of China and in many countries other continents.1 The epidemic originated probably from bat after viral mutation in the spike glycoprotein, as recently suggested,2 began human\u2010to\u2010human transmission. The rapid spread of epidemic generated fear leading China authorities to restrict people movement to and from Wuhan in China, where the first start of epidemic was reported. As of 12 February 2020, 45\u2009206 cases have been documented with 44\u2009687 cases in Mainland China, including 1117 deaths and 5123 recovered https://gisanddata.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6. The emergence of such a novel, highly virulent pathogen warrants rapid investigation of its etiology and evolution to control the impact on human health.\nKnowledge about COVID\u20102019 is still incomplete, many questions have raised and many answers are needed first of all regarding its pathogenicity, its ability to change, how many people will get sick from each infected person, the so\u2010called R0 and when infection will be preventable or treatable.3 In the last period where many researchers are intensively studying the mechanism of COVID\u20102019 replication, pathogenicity, and therapeutic strategies, the present study has been realized. The aim was to provide information about how quickly the virus could potentially increase its genetic variability, with important implications for disease progression and drug or vaccine development. At this aim the Open Reading Frame 1ab (ORF1ab) of COVID\u20102019 has been analyzed to evidence the presence of mutation caused by selective pressure on the virus and their influence on viral ability to infect human host promoting epidemic spread.2 MATERIALS and METHODS\n2.1 Sequence dataset\nThe ORF1ab of 15 COVID\u20102019 sequences have been downloaded from GISAID (https://www.gisaid.org/) and GenBank (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/) databanks. A dataset has been built using the five sequences of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) virus and five sequences from Bat SARS\u2010like virus sharing the highest sequence similarity to the COVID\u20102019 sequence (Table 1). The pairwise percentage of similarity has been calculated using Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi); duplicated sequences have been removed from the dataset. The 25 sequences have been aligned using a multiple sequence alignment multiple alignment using fast fourier transform online tool4 and manually edited using Bioedit program v7.0.5.5\nTable 1.

In particular, non structural protein 2 (nsp2) differs from bat Coronavirus for 11 residues while nsp3 for 64 residues of which 44 are conservative changes.\nAdaptive Evolution Server (http://www.datamonkey.org/) was used to find eventual sites under of positive or negative selection pressure. At this purpose the following tests has been used: fast\u2010unconstrained Bayesian approximation (FUBAR).6 These tests allowed to infer the site\u2010specific pervasive selection, the episodic diversifying selection across the region of interest and to identify episodic selection at individual sites.7 Statistically significant positive or negative selection was based on P\u2009<\u2009.05.\n2.3 Structural modelling\nHomology modelling has been attempted with SwissModel8 and HHPred9 servers. Models for ORF1ab nsp2 and nsp3 proteins available at the I\u2010Tasser web site (corresponding to codes QHD43415_2 and QHD43415_3)10 have been considered. PDB Proteins structurally close to the target have been evaluated using the TM\u2010score11 while the RAMPAGE12 online tool has been used to assess the folding quality of the model.\nTo test for the presence of transmembrane helical segments in Coronavirus ORF1ab nsp2 and nsp3, TMHMM,13 MEMSAT,14 and MEMPACK15 online tools have been used. Three\u2010dimensional structures have been analyzed and displayed using PyMOL.163 RESULTS\n3.1 Selective pressure analysis\nRegarding the FUBAR analysis performed on the ORF1ab region, the presence of potential sites under positive selective pressure have been found (P\u2009<\u2009.05), in particular: on the amino acidic position 501 the COVID\u20102019 has a glutamine residue, the Bat SARS\u2010like coronavirus has a threonine residue and the SARS virus has an alanine residue. At position 723 in the COVID\u20102019 there is a serine residue while the Bat SARS\u2010like virus and the SARS virus have a glycine residue. On the aminoacidic position 1010, the COVID\u20102019 has a proline residue, the Bat SARS\u2010like coronavirus has a histidine residue and the SARS virus has an isoleucine residue. Significant (P\u2009<\u2009.05) pervasive negative selection in 2416 sites (55%) has been evidenced and confirmed by FUBAR analysis.\n3.2 Structural modelling\nTo map the structural variability of the ORF1ab region of the virus and its sites under selection pressure, homology modelling has been attempted. Unfortunately, neither SwissModel nor HHPred found suitable templates for the amino acid region containing the sites under selective pressure. For that reason, the corresponding models available on the I\u2010Tasser web site has been used. Moreover, some regions of the nsp2 and nsp3 proteins structurally homologous to other known viral proteins have been identified through HHpred analysis and have been mapped within the ORF1ab nsp2 and nsp3 sequences (Figure 1).\nFigure 1\nOpen in figure viewerPowerPoint\nA, HHpred mapping of the homologous structures onto the ORF1ab sequence shown as a blue line on the top of the panel. Numbering above the line refers to the entire ORF. Red and Blue strips represent the PDB homologous structures and the nsp2 and nsp3 sequences, respectively. PDB codes are reported within the corresponding red stripes. Numbering below the blue line is relative to each single nsp. Orange lines indicate approximately the positions of the transmembrane helices predicted by MEMSAT. Label refers to panel B. B, diagram of the topology of predicted transmembrane helices. Number refer to the corresponding nsp sequences. nsp, non structural protein; ORF, open reading frame\nThe results of the analysis suggest the presence of a segment within the nsp2 and the nsp3 regions that has no evident homologous structures. In an attempt to structurally characterize as far as possible these regions, TMHMM, MEMSAT, and MEMPACK analyses have been utilized and have shown the presence of several potential trans\u2010membrane helices (Figure 1). In particular, our transmembrane helices were predicted by MEMSAT in nsp2 while six helices were predicted by MEMSTA and TMHMM in nsp3 (Figure 1).\nReferring to the amino acids under positive selective pressure found using the FUBAR analysis: the amino acid in position 501 (position 321 of the nsp2 protein), the corresponding site in the Bat SARS\u2010like coronavirus has an apolar amino acid while the SARS and COVID\u20102019 has a polar amino acid. It can be speculated, that due to its side chain length, polarity, and potential to form H\u2010bonds the glutamine amino acid may confer higher stability to the protein. The mutations fall within the protein nsp2 on the region homologous to the endosome\u2010associated protein similar to the avian infectious bronchitis virus (PDB 3ld1) that plays a key\u2010role in the viral pathogenicity. (Figure 2) In the nsp2 structure model available at the I\u2010Tasser site, this position appears to be exposed to the solvent.\nFigure 2\nOpen in figure viewerPowerPoint\nI\u2010Tasser model of the COVID\u20102019 nsp2. Residues under positive selective pressure with a P\u2009<\u2009.05 are shown as sticks and transparent spheres and are marked by the corresponding labels. COVID\u20102019, novel Coronavirus; nsp2, non structural protein\u20102\nAs for the residue in position 723 (543 in the nsp3 protein), the COVID\u20102019 sequence displays a Ser replacing for Gly in Bat SARS\u2010like and SARS coronaviruses. In this case, it may be argued that this substitution could increase local stiffness of the polypeptide chain both for steric effect (at variance with Ser, Gly has no side chain) and for ability of Ser side chain to form H\u2010bonds. Moreover, Ser can act as a nucleophile in determined structural environments, such as those of enzyme active sites. Within the I\u2010Tasser model, this position is predicted to have a low solvent accessibility (Figure 2).\nRegarding the amino acid in position 1010 (corresponding to position 192 of the nsp3 protein), the homologous region of the Bat SARS\u2010like coronavirus and SARS virus have a polar and an apolar amino acid, respectively, while the COVID\u20102019 has proline. In this case, it may be speculated that due to the steric bulge and stiffness of the proline, the molecular structure of the COVID\u20102019 may undergo a local conformation perturbation compared with the proteins of the other two viruses. In Nsp3, the mutation falls near the protein similar to a phosphatase present also in the SARS coronavirus (PDB code 2acf) playing a key\u2010role in the replication process of the virus in infected cells17 (Figure 3). In the I\u2010Tasser model, the position is partially accessible to the solvent. It should be emphasized that all these considerations are speculative and they need to be substantiated by the availability of the experimental crystallographic structure of the corresponding proteins.\nFigure 3\nOpen in figure viewerPowerPoint\nI\u2010Tasser model of the COVID\u20102019 nsp3.

COVID\u20102019, novel Coronavirus; nsp, non structural protein4 DISCUSSION\nThe COVID\u20102019 ongoing epidemic is worrying worldwide for its high contagiosity. From its first appearance in Wuhan, China, about 1 month ago, the virus infected thousands people with new cases number rapidly growing every day. For this acceleration in human\u2010to\u2010human transmission in China but with evident spreading also in other countries, World Health Organization declared the epidemic a global health emergency.18, 19\nMany questions are open and need an answer, of these the most frequent is how much this virus can be dangerous and how much it differs from SARS virus which epidemic scared all the world some years ago. In this study some interesting findings have been evidenced to support and fill gaps in knowledge about the new COVID\u20102019 that is still causing infection all over the world.20, 21\nThe positive selective pressure in this protein could justify some clinical features of this virus compared with SARS and Bat SARS\u2010like CoV.22 First which are the probably most common sites undergoing to an aminoacidic change, providing an insight of some important proteins of the COVID\u20102019 that are involved in the mechanism of viral entry and viral replication. This data can contribute for a better understanding of how this virus acts in its pathogenicity. Furthermore, to identify a potential molecular target is fundamental to follow the molecular evolution of the virus suggesting some interesting sites for potential therapy or vaccine.\nThe structural similarity of the region in which falls the positive selective pressure as so as the stabilizing mutation falling in the endosome\u2010associated\u2010protein\u2010like domain of the nsp2 protein, could explain why this virus is more contagious than SARS. The destabilizing mutation happening near the phosphatase domain of the nsp3 proteins could suggest a potential mechanism differentiating COVID\u20102019 from SARS.\nThe results of this study could fill some gaps about COVID\u20102019 knowledge especially in the actual moment when the epidemic is ongoing and the scientific community is trying to enrich knowledge about this new viral pathogen. During epidemic, all strength has to be done to enforce virus fight. This can be achieved by understanding the main drivers for pathogen appearance, spreading, and supremacy on human defense.", "25723": "1 INTRODUCTION\nOn 30 January 2020, the World Health Organization declared that the outbreak of an infection due to a novel\u2010coronavirus (SARS\u2010CoV\u20102) was a \u201cPublic Health Emergency of International Concern\u201d (https://www.who.int/news\u2010room/detail/30\u201001\u20102020\u2010statement\u2010on\u2010the\u2010second\u2010meeting\u2010of\u2010the\u2010international\u2010health\u2010regulations\u2010(2005)\u2010emergency\u2010committee\u2010regarding\u2010the\u2010outbreak\u2010of\u2010novel\u2010coronavirus\u2010(2019\u2010nCoV)). Emerging as a human pathogen in the Chinese city of Wuhan, SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 (https://www.who.int/docs/default\u2010source/coronaviruse/situation\u2010reports/20200121\u2010sitrep\u20101\u20102019\u2010ncov.pdf?sfvrsn=20a99c10_4) has caused a widespread outbreak of febrile respiratory illness and, as of 13 February 2020, there were 60\u2009349 confirmed cases (including 527 outside mainland China) and a total of 1360 fatalities (https://gisanddata.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6).\nBelonging to the \u03b2\u2010coronavirus genus of the Coronaviridae family, SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 is closely related to SARS\u2010CoV as there is more than 70% nucleotide similarity in their approximately 30\u2009kb long genomes.1 A recent study has supported the view that, like other \u03b2\u2010coronaviruses causing human infections such as SARS\u2010CoV and MERS\u2010CoV, SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 originated from bats, and reported 96% genomic identity with a previously detected SARS\u2010like bat coronavirus.2, 3 However, it remains unclear whether the spillover also involved a different intermediary animal host.\nIn the case of such an epidemic, it is important to make as reliable as possible an estimate of the basic reproductive number (R0, the number of cases generated from a single infected person) and the dynamics of transmission. The aim of this study was to investigate the temporal origin, rate of viral evolution and population dynamics of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 using 52 full genomes of viral strains sampled in different countries on known sampling dates available at the moment when the study was performed.2 MATERIALS AND METHODS\n2.1 Sequence dataset\nThe analysis was based on 52 SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 sequences publicly available at Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID) on 4 February 2020 (https://www.gisaid.org/). The accession IDs, sampling dates and locations are summarized in Table S1.\nThe sequences were aligned using the ClustalW Multiple Alignment programs included in the accessory application of Bioedit software, manually controlled, and cropped to a final length of 29\u2009774\u2009bp using BioEdit v.7.2.6.1 (http://www.mbio.ncsu.edu/bioedit/bioedit.html.\n2.2 Phylodynamic analysis\nThe simplest evolutionary model best fitting the sequence data were selected using software JmodelTest v.2.1.7 software,4 and proved to be the Hasegawa\u2010Kishino\u2010Yano (HKY) model.\nThe virus' phylogeny, evolutionary rates, times of the most recent common ancestor (tMRCA) and demographic growth were coestimated in a Bayesian framework using a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method implemented in v.1.8.4 of the BEAST package.5\nDifferent coalescent priors and molecular clock models (constant population size, exponential growth, and a Bayesian skyline plot [BSP]) were tested using strict and relaxed molecular clock models. Given the large credibility interval (CI) and high level of uncertainty due to very close sampling dates, all the estimates were made using days as the unit of time and a normal prior with substitution rates obtained from our preliminary estimates (mean rate 2.2\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u22126\u2009subs/site/day, with a standard deviation of 1.1\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u22126).\nThe MCMC analysis was run until convergence with sampling every 100\u2009000 generations. Convergence was assessed by estimating the effective sampling size (ESS) after 10% burn\u2010in using Tracer v.1.7 software (http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/tracer/), and accepting ESS values of 300 or more. The uncertainty of the estimates is indicated by 95% highest marginal likelihoods estimated6 by path sampling (PS)/stepping stone (SS) methods.7\nThe final trees were summarized by selecting the tree with the maximum product of posterior probabilities (pp) (maximum clade credibility) after a 10% burn\u2010in using Tree Annotator v.1.8.4 (included in the BEAST package) and were visualized using FigTree v.1.4.2 (http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/figtree/).\nThe basic reproductive number (R0) was calculated on the basis of the exponential growth rate (r) using the equation R0\u2009=\u2009rD\u2009+\u20091, where D is the average duration of infectiousness estimated as described below.8 The doubling time of the epidemic was directly estimated setting the tree before the coalescent exponential growth analysis with doubling time parameterization.\n2.3 Birth\u2010death skyline estimates of the effective reproductive number (Re)\nThe birth\u2010death skyline model implemented in Beast 2.48 was used to infer changes in the effective reproductive number (Re), and other epidemiological parameters such as the death/recovery rate (\u03b4), the transmission rate (\u03bb), the origin of the epidemic, and the sampling proportion (\u03c1).9 Given that the samples were collected during a short period of time, a \u201cbirth\u2010death contemporary\u201d model was used.\nThe analyses were based on the previously selected HKY substitution model and the evolutionary rate was set to the value of 8.0\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u22124\u2009subs/site/year, which corresponds to the mean substitution rate estimated using a relaxed clock under the exponential coalescent model as transformed into units per year.\nFor the birth\u2010death analysis, one and two intervals and a lognormal prior to Re, with a mean (M) of 0.0 and a variance (S) of 1.0 were chosen, which allows the Re values to change between less than 1 (0.193) and more than 5. A normal prior with M\u2009=\u200948.7 and S\u2009=\u200915 (corresponding to a 95% interval from 24.0 to 73.4) was used for the rate of becoming uninfectious. These values are expressed as units per year and reflect the inverse of the time of infectiousness (5.3\u201019 days; mean, 7.5) according to the serial interval estimated by Li et al.10 Sampling probability (\u03c1) was estimated assuming a prior \u03b2 (\u03b1\u2009=\u20091.0 and \u03b2\u2009=\u2009999), corresponding to a minority of the sampled cases (between 10\u22125 and 10\u22123). The origin of the epidemic was estimated using a normal prior with M\u2009=\u20090.1 and S\u2009=\u20090.05\u2009in units per year.\nThe MCMC analyses were run for 30 million generations and sampled every 3000 steps.\nConvergence was assessed on the basis of ESS values (ESS\u2009>\u2009200). Uncertainty in the estimates was indicated by 95% highest posterior density (HPD) intervals.\nThe mean growth rate was calculated on the basis of the birth and recovery rates (r\u2009=\u2009\u03bb\u2009\u2212\u2009\u03b4), and the doubling time was estimated by the equation: doubling time\u2009=\u2009ln(2)/r.113 RESULTS\nThe sequence analyses under a relaxed (uncorrelated lognormal) or strict molecular clock showed that the former performed better as assessed by using BF with PS and SS (strict vs relaxed molecular clock BF(PS)\u2009=\u2009\u22128.66 and BF(SS)\u2009=\u2009\u221210.7 for relaxed clock). Comparison of the different demographic models showed that the BSP model best fitted the data (BSP vs exponential growth BF(PS)\u2009=\u20097.3 and BF(SS)\u2009=\u20098.78 for BSP; BSP vs constant population size BF(PS)=\u20098.3; and BF(SS)\u2009=\u200910.7 for BSP).\nThe estimated mean evolutionary rate was 2.15\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u22126\u2009subs/site/day (95% HPD, 3.22\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u22127\u20104.18\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u22126), corresponding to 7.8\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u22124\u2009subs/site/year (95% HPD, 1.1\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u22124\u201015\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u22124).\nThe estimated mean tMRCA corresponding to the root of the tree dated 73 days before the end of January 2020 (95% HPD, 32.5\u2010142.3), corresponding to 18 November 2019 (95% HPD, 10 September 2019\u201028 December 2019).\nThe Bayesian tree showed three main significant clades. The largest clade (pp\u2009=\u2009.84) encompassed 10 sequences and consisted of two significant subclades (pp\u2009=\u2009.9 and pp\u2009=\u20091). Overall, this cluster included fewer recent isolates than the other two clusters, and dated back to 47.5 days ago (95% HPD, 25.5\u201076.6), corresponding to 13 December 2019. The second (pp\u2009=\u2009.99) and third significant clusters (pp\u2009=\u2009.95) dated back to 29.2 (95% HPD, 0.7\u201047.45) and 21.9 (95% HPD 3.6\u201054.7) days ago, corresponding to 1 to 8 January 2020.\nThe BSP showed a rapid increase in the number of infections in a period between approximately 45 and 30 days before the end of January 2020 (Figure 1A).\nFigure 1\nOpen in figure viewerPowerPoint\nA, Bayesian skyline plot of the SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 outbreak.

HPD, highest posterior density\nThe IDs and available data of the sequences involved in the clades are shown in Table S1.\nThe estimated growth rate under the exponential growth model was 0.218 days\u22121, corresponding to an R0 estimation of 2.6 (CI, 2.1\u20105.1). The direct estimation of the doubling time of the epidemic gave a mean of 3.6 days (varying from 1.0 to 7.7). Figure 1B shows the Bayesian birth\u2010death skyline plot of the Re estimates with 95% HPD and indicates that Re increased from less than 1 (mean, 0.8; 95% HPD, 0.3\u20101.3) to a mean value of 2.4 (95% HPD, 1.5\u20103.5) in December 2019, and has since remained at this value. The estimation allowing a single Re gave a mean value of 1.85 (95% HPD, 1.37\u20102.4).\nTable 1 shows the parameters estimated using the birth\u2010death skyline plot. The epidemic originated an estimated mean of 3.7 months (CI, 3\u20104) before the present (BP), corresponding to October to November 2019, before the root tree (3.6 months BP). The estimated recovery rate (the time to becoming noninfectious) was 7.3 days (CI, 4.7\u201016.5 days), whereas the transmission rate (\u03bb) increased from 40.5 to 112.4 in units per year in December 2019. On the basis of these values, the growth rate in the second period is r\u2009=\u20090.17 (0.16\u20100.19), corresponding to a mean doubling time of 4.1 days (range, 3.9\u20104.3).\nTable 1.

The prompt availability of research data on internet platforms such as the GISAID has allowed us and other research groups to make a phylogenetic reconstruction of the origin of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 and to share these findings with other scientists.\nThe temporal reconstruction of the SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 phylogeny obtained in the present study is in line with previous estimates and suggests that the epidemic originated between October and November 2019, several weeks before the first cases were described. This was confirmed by means of coalescent analysis and the birth\u2010death method of estimating the origin of the epidemic. The estimated evolutionary rate is also in line with that of SARS and MERS viruses,12, 13 and the recent estimates concerning SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 (http://virological.org/t/phylodynamic\u2010analysis\u201067\u2010genomes\u201008\u2010feb\u20102020/356).\nOne of the most important epidemiological parameters when monitoring an epidemic is R0 (ie, the number of secondary cases induced by a single infected individual in a totally susceptible population) because it is fundamental to assess the potential spread of a microorganism. Its value changes during an epidemic being called the effective reproduction number (Re). R0 is usually estimated on the basis of the growth rate of the number of cases. The available epidemiological estimates of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 R0 range from 2.2 to 2.9, although they changed from 1.4 to more than 7 during the first phases of the epidemic.10, 14\nRecently developed evolutionary models have made it possible to estimate epidemiological parameters on the basis of phylogenesis,9, 15 and a coalescent and birth\u2010death methods were used to estimate R0 and the changes in the Re of the SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 epidemic during a short period of time. This has allowed us to make a preliminary estimate that mean R0 from the beginning of the epidemic to the first days of February 2020 was 2.2 (range, 3.6\u20105.8), and the birth\u2010death skyline analysis showed an increase in Re from less than 1 to 2.4 (CI, 1.5\u20103.5) during December 2019. This agrees with the BSP analysis showing an increase in the number of infections in the same period of time. Commonly, the Re decreases during an epidemic because the decrease in the number of susceptible individuals. However, an increase in Re could be due to an increase in the transmissibility of the virus or in the contact rates within the population.16 It is, therefore, possible to hypothesize, on the basis of our data, that the first passage of the virus from animal to human occurred through rather inefficient and still unknown transmission modes causing relatively few cases in the early times (before December). In December, the virus acquired a more efficient mode of human\u2010to\u2010human transmission (ie, through droplets), causing exponential growth also detected by the skyline.\nOn the same basis, the estimated epidemic doubling time was 3.6 days with a CI between 1 and 7 days. We also tried to calculate it on the basis of the transmission (\u03bb) and recovery rate (\u03b4) estimated using the birth\u2010death model, which lead to an estimated mean doubling time of 4.1 days, with the most probable values falling between 3.9 and 4.3 days. Previous studies have suggested that the doubling time during the early phases of the epidemic was approximately 7.4 days.10 The difference in the estimate here obtained, may be due to the increased epidemic growth rate observed during the last days of January, or the initial delay in recognizing and reporting new cases.\nThis preliminary study has some limitations. The R values and doubling times were estimated phylogenetically using all of the whole genomes available in a public database at the time the study was carried out (https://www.gisaid.org/). Given the small number of sequences and the relatively short sampling period, the CIs are wide and limit the precision of the estimates. Moreover, the analysis included isolates collected outside mainland China as it is assumed that they all belong to the same epidemic originating in Wuhan.\nSerial intervals were used to estimate the duration of infectiousness, although we do not yet have any information concerning the possible existence and duration of a latent (preinfectious) period that would contribute to the serial interval.\nMore detailed and accurate analyses can be made when a larger number of genomes and more precise data on the infectious period become available. However, although the R0 calculated on the basis of the direct observation of the number of infected individuals may be affected by omissions or delayed notifications of cases,17 a phylogenetic estimate of the same parameter may be more reliable.\nThis became particularly evident recently (on 12 February 2020) when the change in diagnosis classification led to a sudden increase in the reported cases by Hubei, China (https://myemail.constantcontact.com/COVID\u201019\u2010Updates\u2010\u2010\u2010Feb\u201012.html?soid=1107826135286&aid=Kdg8a0rBTAk).\nIn conclusion, these results allowed us to make a phylogenetic estimate of the R0 of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection that is similar to that obtained using conventional epidemiological methods18 (https://www.who.int/news\u2010room/detail/23\u201001\u20102020\u2010statement\u2010on\u2010the\u2010meeting\u2010of\u2010the\u2010international\u2010health\u2010regulations\u2010(2005)\u2010emergency\u2010committee\u2010regarding\u2010the\u2010outbreak\u2010of\u2010novel\u2010coronavirus\u2010(SARS\u2010CoV\u20102), and a possibly shorter estimated doubling time of the number of subjects involved at least during the early phases of the epidemic. They also support the usefulness of phylodynamic as an important complement to classic approaches to the surveillance and monitoring of an emerging infection, even during the course of an epidemic.ACKNOWLEDGMENT\nWe acknowledge the authors, originating and submitting laboratories of the sequences from GISAID.CONFLICT OF INTERESTS\nThe authors declare that there are no conflict of interests.AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS\nAL, GZ, and MG conceived and designed the study.

The patient had a chief complaint that he had a fever (up to a maximum of 39.3\u00b0C), cough productive of white phlegm, stuffy and runny noses, vertigo, fatigue, chest tightness, and nausea, while he had no chest pain, sore throat or breathing problems. He disclosed that he had returned to Wuwei city on January 18 from Wuhan city by car. The patient with a history of hypertension grade 2 and type 2 diabetes has been smoking since he was 27 years old and reported no alcohol abuse. Nasopharyngeal swab specimens were collected on January 23, 29, and 30 according to the CDC guidelines.5 After putting nasopharynx swab into the nasal cavity, twist it on the nasopharynx mucosa, keep it for 10 to 15\u2009seconds, and then remove it, and finally, insert it into a sterile tube containing viral transport medium. The specimens were examined by RT\u2010PCR. Three gene targets including RdRP, E and N genes were detected. The positive expression (CT value \u2264\u200943) of the three genes, or RdRP and E genes, or RdRP and N genes indicates SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 is positive.6 Other examinations were also performed as well. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of the First Affiliated Hospital of Wanan Medical College, and adhered to the tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki. Written informed consent was obtained from the patient for using clinical records in this study.\nBased on his primary laboratory report, chest radiograph, clinical and epidemiologic information, the patient received the treatment of interferon\u2010alpha and methylprednisolone. However, he was transferred to the First Affiliated Hospital of Wannan Medical College, Wuhu, China on January 23, because of acute exacerbation of clinical symptoms including expiratory dyspnea, poor diet, and lethargy. The laboratory tests were shown in Table 1 (day 0). The results indicated the patient with stable vital signs, significantly decreased lymphocytes and increased c\u2010reactive protein but slightly elevated fibrinogen, neutrophil, lactic dehydrogenase, and fibrinogen. A computed tomography (CT) lung imaging was reported as showing the multiple patchy high\u2010density shadows scattered mainly in the border regions of lungs which were solid changes in which the air bronchogram sign was seen or ground\u2010glass opacifications changes, as well as slightly thickened pleura (Figure S1a). Combination therapy was initiated with lopinavir and ritonavir tablets (800/200\u2009mg daily), methylprednisolone (40\u2009mg daily), recombinant human interferon alfa\u20102b (10 million IU daily), ambroxol hydrochloride (60\u2009mg daily) and moxifloxacin hydrochloride (0.4\u2009g daily), to inhibit the virus replication, relieve asthma, resolve phlegm, and implement the empirical antibiotic treatment. In addition, the high flow humidification oxygen inhalation therapy was used for preventing acute hypoxic respiratory failure. The treatment of blood glucose, blood pressure, and rehydration therapy was performed. On the second day of treatment, the patient's temperature had low\u2010grade intermittent fevers (range from 36.0\u00b0C to 37.2\u00b0C). With the exception of occasional chest tightness and shortness of breath, the other symptoms including cough productive of white phlegm, stuffy and runny noses, vertigo, and fatigue were improved. On day 3 of treatment, methylprednisolone was reduced to 20\u2009mg daily and withdraw on day 5. In addition, the high flow humidification oxygen inhalation therapy was removed until the 8th day of treatment, based on the markedly improved respiratory function.

As of 27th January 2020, the death toll from the coronavirus stood at 80, with more than 2500 confirmed cases in China, as well as in 11 other countries.1\nThe virus, first identified in Wuhan, Hubei, China, causes a contagious, respiratory infection. The incubation period is reportedly 2 to 10 days, and studies are underway to determine whether the transmission is possible from asymptomatic individuals.1 Similar to other coronaviruses, 2019\u2010nCoV reportedly possesses a surface glycoprotein. In more established coronavirus pathogenesis, this protein has been shown to bind host cellular receptors and to mediate membrane fusion.2 More importantly, it has been described as a potential vaccine target in both SARS\u2010coronavirus (SARS\u2010CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS\u2010CoV).3, 4\nThis study aimed to identify significant cytotoxic T cell (CTL) and B cell epitopes within the 2019\u2010nCoV surface glycoprotein using bioinformatic analysis. We also studied the potential interaction of the putative CTL epitopes with their corresponding representative major histocompatibility complex (MCH) class I supertypes most frequently observed in the Chinese population. We investigated hydrogen bonding, salt\u2010bridges, and residue\u2010residue contacts between CTL binding epitopes and the MHC class I molecules by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations.2 METHODS\nAmino acid sequence of the 1273 AA, viral surface glycoprotein was retrieved in FASTA format from NCBI Protein Database (YP_009724390.1). Because of the novel nature of 2019\u2010nCoV, we compared the glycoprotein's alignment with the spike glycoprotein of SARS\u2010Cov (UniProt: P59594) to ensure sequence similarity in EMBOSS Water pairwise sequence aligner.5\nNetCTL 1.2 server (http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/NetCTL) was used to identify CTL epitopes within the glycoprotein sequence.6 NetCTL uses NetMHC server's artificial neural networks (ANNs) to predict MHC binding, NetChop\u20103.0 to predict C\u2010terminal cleavages and a weight matrix to calculate TAP transport efficiency to generate predictions. The scores of the three prediction methods are merged into a single score, which can be translated as sensitivity and specificity for the epitope\u2010MHC\u2010I binding event. We predicted MHC\u2010peptide\u2010binding for the following MHC class I supertypes\u2014A2, A3, B7, B44, and B62. Together, these supertypes account for the majority of human leukocyte antigen A (HLA\u2010A) (76.5%) and HLA\u2010B (67.1%) distribution in the Chinese population.7 Epitopes with a combined score of >0.75 (sensitivity\u2009=\u20090.80, specificity\u2009=\u20090.97) were further confirmed in CTLPred (http://crdd.osdd.net/raghava/ctlpred),8 where a consensus scoring approach was taken with thresholds of 0.51 (ANN) and 0.36 (support vector machines).\nThe three highest\u2010scoring epitopes for each supertype were selected for analyses of binding affinity to their corresponding representative supertypes in NetMHCpan 4.0 server which predicted epitope\u2010MHC\u2010I binding using ANN trained on quantitative binding data and mass spectroscopy\u2010derived MHC eluted ligands (http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/NetMHCpan).9 Default threshold % ranks of 0.5 for strong binders, and 2 for weak binders were used.\nBinding CTL epitopes were selected for homology modeling in PEP\u2010FOLD3, and structures with the lowest coarse\u2010grained energy were selected for protein\u2010protein docking with corresponding HLA chains using ZDOCK 3.0.2.10, 11 Complexes that scored the highest, based on interface atomic contact energy, shape complementarity, and electrostatics were selected for MD simulations in NAMD. Structures were solvated inside a TIP3P water box, and neutralized with Cl\u2212 and/or Na+, as required. Energy minimization was carried out in a series of conjugate gradients to ensure appropriate structure geometry. Equilibration with restrained solute atoms was performed in an NPT ensemble (310\u2009K, 1\u2009bar) with periodic boundary conditions, and constant temperature and pressure dynamics via Langevin dynamics and Nose\u2010Hoover Langevin piston respectively. Finally, free production runs, without positional restraints were carried out for 2\u2009ns. Hydrogen bonds between epitopes and HLA chains were mapped in VMD with a two\u2010way donor\u2010acceptor distance of 3\u2009\u00c5 and an angle of 20\u00b0 as thresholds. Residue\u2010residue contacts between epitopes and HLA chains were visualized in a contact map matrix, and salt bridge\u2010forming residues were identified using the oxygen\u2010nitrogen cut\u2010off distance of 3.2\u2009\u00c5.\nSequential B cell epitopes within the surface glycoprotein were identified in BepiPred 2.0 (http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/BepiPred), and residues scoring above the default threshold of 0.5 were further confirmed in ABCPred, with default threshold of 0.51 and an overlapping filter (http://crdd.osdd.net/raghava/abcpred).12, 13 BepiPred 2.0 uses a random forest algorithm trained on epitope and non\u2010epitope amino acids validated from crystal structures, whereas ABCPred employs ANN using fixed\u2010length patterns trained on 700 B cell epitopes and 700 random non\u2010epitopes. To identify discontinuous B cell epitopes, we used Ellipro using the surface glycoprotein structure modeled in RaptorX, and the top five scoring epitopes were selected as significant.14, 15 The modeled structure was validated by the Ramachandran plot generated in RAMPAGE.16 Antigenicity of all identified epitopes was predicted using VaxiJen 2.0.17 Conservation of the sequential epitopes within spike proteins across bat coronavirus (Bt\u2010CoV, UniProt: A3EX94), SARS\u2010CoV, and MERS\u2010CoV (UniProt: K9N5Q8) were studied by multiple sequence alignment in Clustal Omega and visualized in NCBI Multiple Sequence Alignment Viewer.183 RESULTS\nThe surface glycoprotein of 2019\u2010nCoV was found to have 76.3% identity and 87.3% similarity with the spike glycoprotein of SARS\u2010CoV.\nWe identified five CTL epitopes in the surface glycoprotein, with all five epitopes classified as strong binders to their corresponding MHC class I supertype representative (Table 1). During MDs simulations, we observed the CTL epitopes to bind with the peptide\u2010binding groove of MHC class I molecules, which is typically used for antigen presentation. The relevant residues of the epitopes and HLA chains in contact were mapped in a contact map matrix (Figure 1A). We observed salt bridge\u2010forming residues positioned over the viral epitopes in three of the five complexes, as well as continuous hydrogen bonding between epitopes and HLA chains maintained throughout the simulation in all complexes (Figure 1B,C). Mutations in salt bridge\u2010forming amino acids have been shown to weaken TCR recognition of MHC class I\u2010antigen complexes.19 Also, the continuous formation of a set of hydrogen bonds between the MHC molecules and epitopes indicates an accommodating nature of the HLA chains to bind epitopes within the groove between the two helices.20 Our results are therefore optimistic of ideal antigen presentation to CTLs.\nTable 1.

In this study, we attempted to identify significant CTL and B cell epitopes in the surface glycoprotein of 2019\u2010nCoV.\nCTLs can become activated after they detect infected cells presenting the offending viral antigens as part of surface antigen\u2010MHC\u2010I complexes. Successful presentation depends on the effective harboring of antigens by MHC\u2010I molecules via hydrogen bonds and salt bridge interactions that allow both high affinity with broader specificity.21 After docking and structure refinement, we analyzed interactions between individual CTL epitopes and HLA chains of their corresponding MHC class I supertype representative by MDs simulations. We observed multiple, maintained hydrogen bond interactions, in addition to the presence of salt\u2010bridges in three complexes. Collectively, these interactions indicate a potentially successful presentation of the epitopes by MHC class I molecules, thereby activating CTLs and generating immune responses. We compared the epitopes obtained in our study with epitopes predicted in the spike protein of MERS\u2010CoV and SARS\u2010CoV.22, 23 We found one overlapping CTL epitope between MERS\u2010CoV and 2019\u2010nCoV with one gap and one mismatch (YLQPRTFLL/YKLQPLTFLL), and no comparable epitopes with SARS\u2010CoV. In addition to the activation of CTLs, successful immunogens need to generate a persistent humoral immunity and in our study, we identified three sequential and five discontinuous B cell epitopes in the surface glycoprotein.\nThere are a few limitations of our study. Epitope detection in glycoproteins is often complicated by the presence of covalently attached glycans. Modeling viral glycoproteins with the associated glycans is especially challenging due to the lack of related structures, although attempts have been made in hepatitis C and rabies.24, 25 Second, similar to other RNA virus, coronavirus replication is error\u2010prone, with a reported mutation rate of 4\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u22124 substitutions per site per year in SARS\u2010CoV.26 This necessitates urgency in antiviral vaccine development before the identified epitopes are potentially rendered obsolete.", "25758": "1 INTRODUCTION\nA recent outbreak of severe pneumonia was traced in the city Wuhan, Hubei province, China, causing 2761 deaths and at least 81109 cases (25 February 2020). The causative agent of the disease is a member of the Coronaviridae family, designed as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 isolate Wuhan\u2010Hu\u20101 (SARS\u2010CoV\u20102\u2010WH\u2010HU1: MN908947.3).1 Reports indicated that SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 is closely related to three Chinese bat SARS\u2010like coronaviruses (Bat\u2010SL\u2010CoVs) forming a monophyletic cluster, denominated clade 2, within subgenus Sarbecovirus.1-6\nThe polyprotein 1ab (pp1ab) is the largest protein of coronaviruses that through proteolytic cleavage is divided into 16 mature nonstructural proteins (nsps). The nsps are involved in replication and transcription of the viral genome and are responsible for the cleavage of the polyprotein, thus making them attractive antiviral drug targets.7\nDue to the lack of remarkable differences between pp1ab of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 with those from other sarbecoviruses,3, 5 pp1ab of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 has not been thoroughly analyzed. Despite the high similarity between pp1ab proteins, it could be possible to identify distinguishable regions representing molecular signatures for the specific detection of virus strains or to track its evolutive history. In this short communication, we expound a comparative sequence analysis of pp1ab protein of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102.2 MATERIALS AND METHODS\nThe analysis was performed using the phylogenetic\u2010structural sequence analysis; sequence comparisons were made in a phylogenetic order.8 Thus, pp1ab from SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 isolates are compared first, then the polyprotein of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 is contrasted against those from clade 2 of sarbecoviruses. Finally, the protein is set against those from clade 1 and 3. Protein alignments were performed using the alignment tool MAFFT v7 (default parameters). Pairwise comparisons were performed with the Sequence Demarcation Tool\u2010V1.2 (SDT; default parameters). Simplot analyses were conducted with SimPlot v3.5.1. using a sliding window of 200 moving in steps of 30. Pp1ab of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 was the reference sequence (MN908947.3). The phylogenetic relationship of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 was carried out using algorithms included in MEGA v10.0.4. The alignment of 44 full genomes of members of the genus Betacoronaviruses was performed using the alignment tool MAFFT v7. The evolutionary relationships were inferred with the Neighbor\u2010Joining method. The phylogeny test was carried out by the bootstrap method (5000 replicates).3 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION\nAccording to the phylogenetic\u2010structural sequence analysis, first, we compared pp1ab proteins with 144 isolates of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 from patients around the world (Table S1). The analysis displayed that most pp1ab proteins have not changed; only six amino acid changes were detected (Table S2). We consider an amino acid change if two or more sequences have the same mutation. One of these mutations (L3606F), placed in the position 37 of nsp6 protein (L37F), is shared by ten sequences from viruses isolated in China, USA, France, Hong Kong, Italy, and Singapore (Table S2). Coronavirus nsp6 is a transmembrane protein that is associated with nsp3 and nsp4 proteins to form the organelle\u2010like replicative structures (double\u2010membrane vesicles).9 Prediction of transmembrane helices (TMHs) segments in nsp6 protein showed that L37F does not alter the secondary structure of the adjacent transmembrane domains (Figure S1). In fact, the mutation L37F is predicted to be outside of the membrane as part of an unstructured coil segment (32SLFFFL/FYEN) that connects the first (12\u201031 residues) and the second (41\u201060 residues) TMHs (Figure S1). Strikingly, the position 37 of nsp6 protein is a Val residue that is conserved in all analyzed sarbecoviruses (Data S1), except in SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 (Leu). So the mutation of the aliphatic Leu residue for the aromatic Phe residue in this conserved position probably has functional implications; although Leu and Phe are both hydrophobic residues, the Phe residue could also perform cation\u2010\u03c0 interactions that could affect the protein\u2010protein interactions in the L37F mutant. The structural impact of this mutation can not be determined since experimental data in the Protein Data Bank are not available for homology modeling of nsp6 using a single or multiple templates (eg, SWISS\u2010MODEL server, Phyre2, etc.).\nInterestingly, a virus isolated from a Japanese male (GISAID: EPI_ISL_407084), with no critical pneumonia (patient status described in GISAID database), has eight deleted amino acids at position 32 to 39 aa of pp1ab (nsp1) (Table S2). Since nsp1 is a virulence factor that inhibits host gene expression,10 the implications of this deletion are worth to be addressed. However, since the deletion is present in just one isolated virus, this finding needs to be confirmed by other genome sequences.\nFor the second part of the analysis, we compared pp1ab of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 to those of the clade 2 of sarbecoviruses (bat\u2010SL\u2010CoV\u2010ZC45: MG772933; bat\u2010SL\u2010CoV\u2010ZXC21S: MG772934; bat\u2010SL\u2010CoV\u2010RaTG13: MN996532). The pairwise comparison performed with SDT indicated that the most related protein was the one belonging to bat\u2010SL\u2010CoV\u2010RaTG13 (98.6%). Also, proteins from bat\u2010SL\u2010CoV\u2010ZC45 and bat\u2010SL\u2010CoV\u2010ZXC21S showed a pairwise identity above 95%. To determine if the identity is preserved throughout its length, we compared the pp1ab sequences from these viruses via similarity plot analysis. The analysis showed that pp1ab of bat\u2010SL\u2010CoV\u2010ZC45 and bat\u2010SL\u2010CoV\u2010ZXC21S displayed three dissimilarity regions that surround residues 1000 (87.7%), 4670 (91.4%), and 6590 (91.6%) (Figure S2). The pairwise identity between SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 and bat\u2010SL\u2010CoV\u2010RaTG13 is conserved throughout its length.\nScrutiny on the alignment allowed us to note that regions of residues 4631 and 6565 of bat\u2010SL\u2010CoV\u2010ZC45 and bat\u2010SL\u2010CoV\u2010ZXC21S were more similar to those from viruses of clade 3 rather than SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 or bat\u2010SL\u2010CoV\u2010RaTG13. These findings explain why the ORF1b of bat\u2010SL\u2010CoV\u2010ZC45 and bat\u2010SL\u2010CoV\u2010ZXC21S are clustered with those of sarbecoviruses from Clade 3,1 suggesting a recombination history between these viruses with clade 3 members.\nWhen we analyzed the position 1000 of the pp1ab alignment, we identified rich glutamine (~22%) amino acid signature in pp1ab of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 (AS\u2010SCoV2). This signature is 42 aa in length (DSQQTVGQQDGSEDNQTTTIQTIVEVQPQLEMELTPVVQTIE), placed between the amino acids 983 and 1024 of pp1ab, which correspond to the N\u2010terminal of papain\u2010like protease (165 aa to 206 aa). Specifically, AS\u2010SCoV2 is located in the flexible acidic\u2010domain (AC domain) rich in glutamic acid (Figure 1).11 AC domain is flanked by the ubiquitin\u2010like and the ADP\u2010ribose\u20101\u2033\u2010phosphatase domains.10 The functional implication of the AC domain extension conferred by AS\u2010SCoV2 needs to be studied.\nFigure 1\nOpen in figure viewerPowerPoint\nAlignment of pp1ab proteins from sarbecoviruses.

AS\u2010SCoV2, SARS\u2010CoV\u20102; SARS\u2010CoV\u20102, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2\nThe AS\u2010SCoV2 is partially conserved in the pp1a protein of bat\u2010SL\u2010CoV\u2010ZC45 (identity: 40.5%; indels: 6) and virtually missing in bat\u2010SL\u2010CoV\u2010ZXC21S (identity: 16%; indels: 27), while AS\u2010SCoV2 is very conserved in pp1ab of bat\u2010SL\u2010CoV\u2010RaTG13 (identity: 76%; Indels: 0) (Figure 1). These results suggest that SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 is closely related to bat\u2010SL\u2010CoV\u2010RaTG13 rather than bat\u2010SL\u2010CoV\u2010ZC45 or bat\u2010SL\u2010CoV\u2010ZXC21S. The alignment of the pp1ab from members of the subgenus Sarbecovirus showed that the AS\u2010SCoV2 is exclusive of the novel coronavirus and slightly preserved in bat\u2010SL\u2010CoV from clade 2 (Figure 1). We found the same results when we compared the pp1ab of members of the genus Betacoronavirus (Table S3; Data S1). A search in the nucleotide and protein GenBank databases displayed that AS\u2010SCoV2 is codified only in genomes of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102. Also, no proteins other than pp1ab of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 and bat\u2010SL\u2010CoV\u2010RaTG13, partially, have the signature. Because we determined that the presence of AS\u2010SCoV2 in human coronaviruses is restricted only to SARS\u2010CoV\u20102, we suggest that their respective 126 nucleotide sequence can be used to design alternative specific PCR diagnosis for SARS\u2010CoV\u20102.\nThe genome sequences of two sarbecoviruses isolated from the pangolin (Manis javanica) were recently released in GISAID database, one of them was collected in Guangzhou, China in 2019 (Pangolin\u2010BetaCoV\u2010Guandong\u20102019; EPI_ISL_410721) and the other one was collected in Guangxi, China in 2017 (Pangolin\u2010BetaCoV\u2010Guangxi\u20102017; EPI_ISL_410538). Phylogenetic analysis based on genome sequence showed that both viruses collected from pangolins are clustered in the clade 2 (Figure 2). The pairwise comparison of pp1ab protein showed that the protein of Pangolin\u2010BetaCoV\u2010Guandong\u20102019 is 94% identical to those of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 while the pp1ab of Pangolin\u2010BetaCoV\u2010Guangxi\u20102017 has an identity of 92%. Since both pangolin viruses are grouped in clade 2 and their pp1ab proteins are identical to those of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102, we analyzed the alignment of its pp1ab protein to determine if the AS\u2010SCoV2 is present (Figure 1). The homologous region of AS\u2010SCoV2 pp1ab of Pangolin\u2010BetaCoV\u2010Guandong\u20102019 has 34 aa that showed an identity of 35%, whereas the homologous region of AS\u2010SCoV2 in Pangolin\u2010BetaCoV\u2010Guangxi\u20102017 have 36 aa which are completely different from those of sarbecoviruses (Figure 1). These findings suggest that the pp1ab of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 is more closely related to pp1ab of Bat\u2010SL\u2010CoV\u2010RaTG13 than to pp1ab of coronaviruses isolated from Chinese pangolins. Since the region that encodes the pp1ab protein represents about 71% of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 genome, we suggest that it is less likely that the novel human coronavirus has been arising directly from the viruses isolated from pangolins.\nFigure 2\nOpen in figure viewerPowerPoint\nPhylogenetic analysis of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102. The Phylogenetic relationship was inferred with the Neighbor\u2010Joining method based on the genome alignment. Bootstrap values (5000 iterations) are indicated for each node. Dots represent the clade 1 (green), clade 2 (blue), and clade 3 (red). Star indicates the probable acquisition of ancestral AS\u2010SCoV2. The evolutionary distances were computed using the number of differences method. The scale bar, placed below the tree, indicates the number of base differences per sequence. AS\u2010SCoV2, SARS\u2010CoV\u20102; SARS\u2010CoV\u20102, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2\nFirst reports focused on the genetic characterization of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 suggested that this virus has a recombinant origin.2 Our results indicate that most probably, a recombination event did not happen in the first half of the viral genome (ORF1ab). Under this idea, an alternative explanation for SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 origin is that bat\u2010SL\u2010CoV\u2010RaTG13, collected 6 years ago, is the progenitor of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102, which has evolved since the collection date by genetic drift before infecting humans. Three observations support the hypothesis: 1. The high pairwise identity of pp1ab from SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 and bat\u2010SL\u2010CoV\u2010RaTG13 is preserved throughout its length (Figure S2). 2. The exclusive AS\u2010SCoV2 of the novel coronavirus is conserved in bat\u2010SL\u2010CoV\u2010RaTG13 (Figure 1). 3. The high pairwise identity (96.3%) shared by SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 and bat\u2010SL\u2010CoV\u2010RaTG13 is preserved in its whole genome, only a slight dissimilarity region is displayed in the ORF of spike protein.6\nAlthough the origin of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 does not appear to be caused by recent genetic recombination, at least acquisition of genetic material must have given place to AS\u2010SCoV2. Since members of subgenus Sarbecovirus from clade 1 and clade 3 have at the minimum 25 missing aa in its homologous region of AS\u2010SCoV2 and members of clade 2 have sequence traces of AS\u2010SCoV2, except by BetaCoV\u2010pangolin\u2010Guangxi\u20102017 (Figures 1), we suggest the viral ancestor of clade 2 members probably gained the genetic material (Figure 2). In this scenario, the ancestral AS\u2010SCoV2 have been changed over the time by genetic drift evolving to the actual AS\u2010SCoV2. This probably explains why we could not infer the origin of these signature based on the available sequences from databases, although there is a possibility that the organism that donated this segment has not been discovered yet. Regarding the pp1ab of Pangolin\u2010BetaCoV\u2010Guangxi\u20102017, we suggest that a recombination event in the genomic region of the that encodes the first 3500 amino acids of pp1ab probably happened since the AS\u2010SCoV2 is no present in this virus and the Simplot analysis showed several dissimilarity peaks in this region when the pp1ab of Pangolin\u2010BetaCoV\u2010Guangxi\u20102017 is compared with either of clade 2 members of sarbecoviruses (Figure S3).\nThe AS\u2010SCoV2 located in the acidic\u2010domain of papain\u2010like protein from SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 and bat\u2010SL\u2010CoV\u2010RaTG13 guided us to suggest that the novel human\u2010pathogenic coronavirus probably emerged by genetic drift from bat\u2010SL\u2010CoV\u2010RaTG13. The implication of AS\u2010SCoV2 in papain\u2010like protein structure arrangement and function is something worth to be explored.ACKNOWLEDGMENT\nThis research was funded by CONACYT of Mexico (grant number: APN\u20102015\u201001\u2010741) to Y.C.C.

So far, 42\u2009638 people have been diagnosed as 2019\u2010nCoV pneumonia, which also known as Wuhan pneumonia, among them, 7333 are severe cases, 1016 patients died, and only 3996 patients have been cured in the mainland of China (Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan were excluded).1 All 31 provincial\u2010level regions and the Xinjiang Production Corps have the confirmed cases.1 Hubei province, where believed to be the origin of Wuhan pneumonia outbreak, suffers the most, with 31\u2009728 confirmed cases and 974 death cases.2 The trend of cumulative cases is soaring, including 24 other countries outside of China had confirmed cases. With a remarkable notice that the total number of cases has far exceeded the number during severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) period. The first case of 2019\u2010nCoV pneumonia was linked to wild animal trading in the Huanan seafood market in the city of Wuhan, the capital of Hubei province.3 Zhou et al4 found the initial source of 2019\u2010nCoV probably originated from the Chinese horseshoe bat since the novel coronavirus was 96% identical to a bat coronavirus at a whole genome level. This coronavirus, which has not been identified in humans previously, had been detected from patients in Wuhan5 and it was the first case for human infection with 2019\u2010nCoV from wild animals.6 Recently, Wu et al7 estimated 75\u2009815 individuals would be infected in Wuhan, with an uncertainty range from 37\u2009304 to 130\u2009330 by using the susceptible\u2010exposed\u2010infectious\u2010recovered model. While the variation of the virus is still under surveillance.\nCoronaviruses are a huge family of viruses, of which severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS\u2010nCoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS\u2010nCoV), and so on have already known by humans.8 The 2019\u2010nCoV has an incubation period of 3 to 7 days in general, with a maximum of 14 days.9 The most common symptoms at the onset of illness are fever, cough, and myalgia or fatigue.9, 10 While a few patients might have stuffiness, pharyngalgia, or diarrhea.9 By far, the main sources of infection are 2019\u2010nCoV infected humans, however, the asymptomatic infection might also be a source of infection.9 These patients are not easy to be detected among the population when initially infected but might have headache, fever, dyspnea, fatigue, and so on later.11 This type of coronavirus has been proved could spread from person to person through the respiratory tract and contact transmission.9, 12 Zhang et al13 pointed out the digestive system might also be a potential route of 2019\u2010nCoV infection based on bioinformatics analysis. Wu et al7 found R0, the basic reproduction number is around 2.68 with 2.47 to 2.86 of 95% credible interval, by applied Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods, where transmission characteristics appear to be similar of SARS.14 Mild and occult cases could be the major concerns for disease prevention.15, 16 The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends wearing a medical mask when leaving homes17 and ethanol and the high temperature had been proved could prevent disease occurrence.9 The event has been determined as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern by WHO.18\nHumans are generally susceptible to coronavirus.9 The youngest infected patient is only 1 month after birth.19 Death cases were mostly found in the elderly and who already have chronic conditions.10, 20 The confirmed case is defined as either positive of novel coronavirus nucleic acid by real\u2010time fluorescent reverse transcription\u2010polymerase chain reaction detection of respiratory or blood specimens or highly homologous to any known novel coronaviruses through virus gene sequencing of respiratory or blood specimens. Only when body temperature returns to normal for more than 3 days, respiratory symptoms significantly improved and two consecutive tests negative of the nucleic acid of respiratory pathogens, with at least 1 day on sampling interval, people could be allowed to discharge from hospital9 (Figure 1).\nFigure 1\nOpen in figure viewerPowerPoint\nThe trend of 2019\u2010nCoV pneumonia cases\nFigure 2\nOpen in figure viewerPowerPoint\nThe key nodes in 2019\u2010nCoV pneumonia event\nThe Chinese government has taken emergency measures to support population prevention and clinical treatment after the outbreak and made remarkable progress in responding to disease control comparing with SARS time (Figure 3).8, 21 The National Health Commission has set 2019\u2010nCoV pneumonia as a category B infectious disease with A\u2010class management on 20 January.22 Provincial Bureau of health from Shanghai, Anhui, Zhejiang, and so on have organized medical teams, mainly including medical staff from the respiratory department, infections department and critical care medication, hurried to Wuhan for medical support.23 \u201cHuo Shen Shan\u201d had been established for the centralized treatment of Wuhan pneumonia patients by reference to the model of Xiao Tang Shan hospital in Beijing during the SARS period. Although the cure rate has been rising up, compared with the fast\u2010growing cases and fatality rate from the updated collected data, it is still required to improve (Table 1). Through the efforts of scientists, Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has obtained the full\u2010length genome of 2019\u2010nCoV from clinical specimens and found the sequence of the genome has significant differences from any known coronavirus,24 which is most related to the nucleotide sequence of bat\u2010SL\u2010CoVZC45 with 85% sequence similarity.24, 25 All the found genome sequence of 2019\u2010nCoV has been published as open data for scientific research as disease prevention and control.25 CDC is also conducting the medication screening for Wuhan pneumonia and developing a vaccine for 2019\u2010nCoV. University of Queensland, GeoVax Labs Inc, and other world\u2010class research teams have also been joining in the research of vaccine development.26, 27 The Ministry of Health Disease Control Bureau also takes psycho crisis intervention and assistance for the population in need.

It was found that most early cases were linked to a local fresh seafood market, the Huanan Seafood Market, although some\u2014particularly later cases\u2014were not.2 Initial investigations identified a novel bat coronavirus as a possible culprit, which was subsequently confirmed by detection of viral sequences by multiple teams independently, and by virus isolation from the lower respiratory tracts of patients.3, 5 The novel virus has been named novel coronavirus (nCoV)\u20102019. Genomic sequences of viruses from five cases are shown to be almost identical to one another, with the homology of 79.5% to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)\u2010CoV and 85% to 96% to a bat SARS\u2010like coronavirus (bat\u2010SL\u2010CoVZC45) at the whole genome level.4 The outbreak thus represents a newly emerging viral disease due to species jumping of a virus to humans.\nFigure 1\nOpen in figure viewerPowerPoint\nCT images of patients with novel coronavirus pneumonia.

Her body temperature at presentation was 38.8\u00b0C, CBC showed WBC 4.6\u2009\u00d7\u2009109/L, neutrophilic differential 65.8%, and lymphocytic differential 19.9% (reduced).

CBC, complete blood count; CT, computed tomography; WBC, white blood cells\nInitially, it was thought that the infection showed no or limited human\u2010to\u2010human transmission. However, soon after it became evident that transmission among humans constitutes the main mechanism of infection spread, in community, health care facilities, and at home. The diagnoses were made purely based on clinical and radiographical grounds, lack of response to antibiotic therapy, and exclusion of other common respiratory infections for the season.1-3 With the newly identified genetic sequence information, diagnostic tests based on detection of the viral sequence by reverse\u2010transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT\u2010PCR) or next\u2010generation sequencing platforms soon became available. This allowed for diagnosis confirmation and better estimates of infection activity, which was found to be increasing at alarming speeds. The municipal government issued a public warning and implemented a total shutdown of transportation on 23 January 2020, advising individual isolation. On 30 January 2020, a World Health Organization panel declared this outbreak a public health emergency of international concern. As of 31 January 2020, the confirmed cases reached 9811 nationwide, and 15\u2009238 suspected cases (Figure 2).\nFigure 2\nOpen in figure viewerPowerPoint\nA, Daily update of accumulated suspected (yellow curve) and confirmed (red curve) nCov\u20102019 infections in China as of 31 January 2020. B, Daily update of newly confirmed (blue curve) and suspected cases (from China National Health Commission Bulletin)1 CLINICAL ASPECTS AND DIAGNOSIS\nClinically, patients with novel coronaviral pneumonia are characterized by fever with or without chills, dry cough, chest tightness, and shortness of breath.1-3 Chest computerized tomography (CT) scan shows patchy to diffuse interstitial infiltrates or thickening (Figure 1), some with the characteristic ground\u2010glass\u2010like density. Very severe cases can develop radiographic changes of the so\u2010called \u201cwhite lungs.\u201d Laboratory tests show lowered lymphocytes and white blood cell counts in most patients, among other abnormalities.2 The China National Health Commission communicated guidelines6 for initial diagnosis and disease severity triage into common (mild), severe, and critical categories. Diagnosis is based on epidemic exposure, plus two of the following clinical findings: fever, radiographic features as described above, normal or lowered white blood cells, or reduced lymphocyte count.\nThe common (mild) cases are those with fever, respiratory symptoms, and pneumonia on chest radiography. Severe cases need to meet one of the following criteria: (a) respiratory distress, RR\u2009\u2265\u200930/minutes; (b) resting blood oxygen saturation\u2009\u2264\u200993%; or (c) arterial blood oxygen partial pressure (PaO2)/FiO2\u2009\u2264\u2009300 mm\u2009Hg. Critical cases meet one of the following: (a) respiratory failure needing mechanical oxygenation; (b) shock; or (c) development of other organ failures, requiring intensive care unit care. Around 70% to 80% of patients are mild, and 20% to 30% are severe or critical (Peng ZY, personal communication).\nThe diagnosis needs to be differentiated from influenza, parainfluenza, adenovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, rhinovirus, SARS coronavirus, mycoplasma, chlamydia, and bacterial pneumonia, as well as noninfectious diseases such as vasculitis.2, 62 DIAGNOSIS USING THE RNA\u2010BASED ASSAYS\nCurrently, the diagnosis of suspected cases is confirmed by RNA tests with real\u2010time RT\u2010PCR or next\u2010generation sequencing. It had been shown that viral RNA can be detected from the nasal and pharyngeal swab, bronchoalveolar lavage, and blood plasma using RT\u2010PCR targeting the NP gene of the virus.2, 4, 6 Before the Wuhan city\u2010wide shutdown, specimens for confirmatory tests had to be sent to China CDC, with a long turnaround time. Subsequently, several main tertiary care hospitals in Wuhan were authorized to perform the tests. Therefore, in the earlier stages of the outbreak, a very limited number of patients were tested and confirmed for the diagnosis. Since 25 January tests have become increasingly available for clinically suspected patients, with a history of exposure, fever, and positive findings on chest CT. However, since only a limited number of tests can be offered each day due to limited supplies and lab facilities, only a portion of the targeted population received tests. For example, during the month of January 2020, only 1700 specimens were tested (media report by the hospital on WeChat, 1/29/2020), compared with the vast number of clinic patients during that period (between 22 January and 30 January alone, there were over 7000 visits to one of the designated fever clinic). This created a significant backlog, as many patients had to wait for days to receive a confirmation or exclusion of diagnosis. It also led to problems in real\u2010time reporting, causing artificial fluctuation in daily updates of new cases (Figure 2B). For example, as shown in Table 1, using data collected from the National Health Commission's daily updates,7 on some dates, the change in the number of newly confirmed cases varies drastically. This cannot be explained by realistic changes in the speed of infection spread. Needless to say, the recorded figures of daily confirmed cases are likely underestimated.\nTable 1.

Based on personal communications with colleagues, a significant portion of patients who otherwise fit the diagnosis based on clinical and chest CT findings, including many hospitalized patients, have tested negative for viral RNA. Other common respiratory etiologies, such as influenza, were excluded. These remain \u201csuspected\u201d cases and may be reflective of false negativity in sampling. In some patients, the virus may be present in the lower respiratory secretion but absent in the upper respiratory tracts.\nWith the current tests, it is therefore difficult to achieve a meaningful assessment of what proportion of symptomatic patients are infected.3 SEROLOGICAL ASSAYS ARE NEEDED\nData from the SARS epidemic show that serological responses, including viral\u2010specific immunoglobulin M (IgM) and IgG, can allow for serologic diagnosis.8, 9 Most recently, it was shown that patients with 2019\u2010nCov pneumonia also possessed similar acute serological responses.4 Using the bat SARSr\u2010111 CoV Rp3 nucleocapsid protein (NP) as an antigen, both IgG and IgM antibodies could be detected with enzyme\u2010linked immunoassay (ELISA) in these patients. The dynamic pattern is consistent with an acute viral infection, with the IgG concentration beginning to rise as IgM levels start to drop.4\nAs we know, the production of host antibodies to a specific virus during an acute phase infection is consistent in most patients, except for those with immunodeficiency. The IgM antibody can be detected as early as day 3 in many infections. The requirement for specimen quality is less stringent than for RNA\u2010based assays. Whether viruses themselves are present in respiratory specimens, the presence of a specific antibody can be uniformly detected, avoiding false\u2010negative results due to sampling. Most importantly, with the regular 96\u2010well microplate, and automatic ELISA devices, the test capacity is greatly increased compared to RNA\u2010based molecular tests and can handle a large number of febrile patients such as in the current epidemic, with a quick turnaround time (2\u20103\u2009hours). For example, hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome caused by hantavirus was endemic in Hubei Province, with a high annual incidence in the 1980s and 1990s. The rapid and specific etiologic diagnosis was critical for patient management and epidemic controls. An IgM\u2010capture ELISA was used to quickly screen all febrile patients effectively during those epidemic seasons.10, 11 Similarly, for the novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCVP) situation, an IgM\u2010capture ELISA can offer earlier and more efficient confirmation or exclusion of the nCoV\u20102019 infection in patients with fever, thus adding to the accuracy of epidemiologic monitoring and facilitating proper isolation of patients.\nFrom a technical point of view, although the NP can serve as a sensitive antigen, other 2019\u2010nCoV\u2010specific epitopes or antigens should be explored for use in the serology assay. It has been reported that the N protein of SARS CoV antigenically cross\u2010reacted with antisera of antigenic group\u2010I animal coronaviruses such as human coronavirus 229E, feline infectious peritonitis virus, and porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC404591/). Therefore, the use of the whole N protein as the antigen for serological assay could lead to specificity and sensitivity issues potentially.\nDuring this current outbreak, one of the authors volunteered in one of the designated fever clinics. The scene was astonishing, with over a thousand of anxious patients with illnesses ranging from mild to severe, all lined up and waiting over 4\u2009hours to be seen. The vast majority could be individuals without infection by nCoV\u20102019, yet all the protection they had was facial masks. One cannot imagine how much risk for cross infection can occur in such over\u2010crowded situations. If some rapid viral diagnostic tests were available, the situation would be completely different. Patients could quickly have blood drawn when they first arrive and wait elsewhere to receive the results. Or they could have blood drawn in their own communities (common residential areas called \u201cXiao Qu\u201d in Wuhan, as in most other cities) to avoid a trip to the clinics and high potential for nCoV\u20102019 exposure. Coincident with the 2019\u2010nCoV outbreak is the season for several other common respiratory etiologies, such as influenza and the common cold. After the city\u2010wide shutdown and heightened public warning, there was a surge of clinic patients. Many patients would visit several clinics or the same clinic daily, trying to be selected for RNA tests. A significant number of them had symptoms or lab findings that are not consistent with NCVP, such as elevated lymphocytes and lack of chest CT findings. With a serological test, these patients could avoid the clinic visits.\nCurrently, RNA\u2010based molecular tests require upscale lab facilities with restrictive biosafety levels and technical sophistication, and expensive. The screening patient population is in both large medical centers or smaller community\u2010level hospitals. Serologic tests can be easily implemented in the clinical laboratory of any hospital, thus with a much wider application than molecular tests.\nAnother issue for consideration is reporting of asymptomatically infected cases, or very mild cases of infection who are a large group of patients but not tested for viral RNA (which is impractical), therefore making the true rate of infection in the population unknown. With the development of a specific IgG antibody test, a large\u2010scale sero\u2010epidemiological study can be conducted after the end of the current outbreak, so that we can understand the true scale of human\u2010to\u2010human transmission of the novel coronavirus of 2019.\nA fast\u2010performing serologic assay is acutely needed for the current and future outbreaks.ACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThe authors would like to thank Dr Haibo Xu for graciously providing the computed tomography images and Dr Jingyi Fan for sharing her personal observations.CONFLICT OF INTERESTS\nThe authors declare that there are no conflict of interests.", "25708": "Biological investigation of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 biology has revealed several general characteristics of the virus. SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 is a novel coronavirus, which has a ~30\u2009kb single\u2010stranded positive sense RNA genome with an organization typical of other coronaviruses such as SARS and MERS.1 Although phylogenetic analysis indicate it belongs to the same \u03b2\u2010coronavirus genus as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS\u2010CoV) and middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS\u2010CoV), SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 has a higher genome\u2010sequence similarity to several \u03b2\u2010coronaviruses detected in bats. It shows more than 96% identity to a known bat coronavirus, compared to 79.5% identity to SARS\u2010CoV BJ01.1, 2\nStudies investigating the clinical characteristics, epidemic and treatment have also been carried out. According to clinical investigation of the pneumonia cases in China, SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection causes SARS with major symptoms such as fever, cough, myalgia, or fatigue and minor symptoms such as sputum production, headache, hemoptysis, and diarrhea.3\nAs more data become available, additional case features are also being revealed. More than half of the initial cases had visited the Wuhan Huanan seafood market. It is also apparent that the outcome of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 pneumonia is enormously destructive, despite a mortality rate less than 3% (according to the latest data on February 8th, 2020 in China4) when compared with SARS\u2010CoV (mortality rate 9.6%) and MERS\u2010CoV (mortality rate 9.6% and 34%).5 However, the spread of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection is much broader than SARS or MERS\u2010CoV and involves larger numbers of patients.\nThe symptom onset date of the first identified patient infected by SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 was December 1st, 2019, which is about 14 days before the subsequent reported cases.3 The first estimate of mean incubation time was based on the exposure information of 10 confirmed early SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infected cases in Wuhan, China and was predicted to be 5.2 days (95% confidence interval [CI]: 4.1\u20107.0),6 supporting the case for a longer incubation time compared to SARS\u2010CoV (mean incubation time 4.0 days, 95% CI: 3.6\u20104.4)7 and MERS\u2010CoV in Saudi Arabia/Middle east area (range of incubation times 4.5\u20105.2 days, mean value/95% CI not reported).8 A longer incubation time may lead to a high rate of asymptomatic and subclinical infection among immunocompetent individuals. A popular hypothesis circulating on social media is that the rapid spread of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 is a consequence of a longer incubation time, that is, while it can give the host the chance to develop immunity, it may also facilitate the spread of infection.\nThe reported estimate of the SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 incubation time was based on limited case data. A subsequent unpublished study from 88 cases estimated a mean incubation time of 6.4 days (95% CI, 5.6\u20107.7 days).9 However, the data were taken from an online resource,10 and only a subset of these data (25 patients) had both clearly defined start and stop dates for exposure, together with a date for onset of symptoms. The patients from Wuhan had extended exposure times by December 14th. As an alternative approach, we limited our dataset to the patients whose exposure periods were well\u2010defined. As of February 8th, 2020, this comprised 50 patients (Supporting Information Material). We also collected additional raw data from earlier reports on SARS (153 patients) and MERS (70 patients) outbreaks (Supporting Information Material). We then fitted \u201cWeibull\u201d, \u201clognormal,\u201d and \u201cgamma\u201d functions to the respective datasets. These are shown for SARS\u2010CoV\u20102, SARS, and MERS datasets in Figure 1A\u2010C, respectively. The corresponding mean and 95% CI were: SARS\u2010CoV\u20102, 4.9 (4.4\u20105.5) days; SARS, 4.7 (4.3\u20105.1) days; and MERS 5.8 (5.0\u20106.5) days (Figure 1E). A pairwise comparison between each of the three datasets (Mann\u2013Whitney test) showed no significant differences (Supporting Information Material). The discrepancy between our results and other studies can be understood by examining the individual datasets. These are summarized as boxplots in Figure 1D and have notably varying distributions. For the MERS datasets, for example, we found only five reports published with accessible raw data, but one report had several patients with incubation times ranged from 0 to 21 days. It is unclear whether these data were included in the other datasets. If these data are included in the analysis, it significantly impacts the outcome for estimation of incubation times 7.5 (7.1\u20107.9) days (Figure S1). Thus, any conclusions based on comparisons between SARS\u2010CoV\u20102, SARS, and MERS incubation times are arbitrarily dependent on the selected data sources.\nFigure 1\nOpen in figure viewerPowerPoint\nEstimated incubation times for SARS\u2010CoV\u20102, SARS\u2010CoV, and MERS\u2010CoV.

E, Estimated incubation times for SARS\u2010CoV\u20102, SARS\u2010CoV, and MERS\u2010CoV. See Table S1 for raw data and references\nThe challenge of finding suitable data extends to investigations of other important characteristics of the SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 outbreak:\nReproduction number R0. There has been significant variation in the reported values of R0 according to the dataset used in the analysis.\nClinical symptoms. Diverse clinical symptoms have been described, but this information is only available for a limited number of reported cases.\nTransmission routes. There are still debates on possible routes besides aerosol transmission for human\u2010to\u2010human infection. There is now evidence of viral presence in feces and on the object surface, indicating possibilities of waterborne and contact transmission, which may account for the infection from asymptomatic patients.\nThus, access to well\u2010annotated data related to these topics from clinical patients and subclinical subjects will help our understanding for each of these factors. Our results indicate that the current 14 days isolation period should be continued until more comprehensive data are available. To this end, we make the following suggestions:\n1.\nData should be ideally annotated using standard metadata tags, for example, from the Disease Ontology (disease\u2010ontology.org) to aid data standardization, integration, and analysis.\n2.\nStudy subjects should include not only patients and suspected infected individuals, but also the samples from the \u201cnormal\u201d population.\nClinicians can help support these efforts by carefully collecting and capturing as much relevant patient data where possible. In this way, more complete datasets can be constructed, allowing for more in\u2010depth analyses to better determine optimal intervention strategies and patient treatment.", "25709": "1 INTRODUCTION\nIn late December 2019, clusters of patients with pneumonia of unknown etiology were reported by the local health facilities in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.1 In early January 2020, the causative agent of mysterious pneumonia has been identified as a novel coronavirus by several independent laboratories located in China. The causative virus has been temporarily named as 2019 novel coronavirus (2019\u2010nCoV) by the World Health Organization.2 According to the daily report of the World Health Organization, the epidemic of 2019\u2010nCoV so far caused 45,171 laboratory confirmed cases and 1114 death in China, as well as 441 confirmed cases and 1 death in 24 other countries by 12th February 2020.\nCoronaviruses are distributed broadly among humans and animals and cause respiratory, enteric, hepatic, and neurologic diseases. So far, 2019\u2010nCoV is the seventh member of the family of coronaviruses that infects humans. Preceding the 2019\u2010nCoV epidemic, the 21st century has already seen outbreaks caused by two other highly pathogenic coronaviruses, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS\u2010CoV) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS\u2010CoV). These outbreaks result from zoonotic coronavirus crossing the species barrier and causing high morbidity and mortality in human populations.3, 4 The 2019\u2010nCoV, SARS\u2010CoV, and MERS\u2010CoV show several similarities regarding the clinical presentations, which can vary from asymptomatic infection to severe disease; severe acute respiratory syndrome.5, 6 Therefore, our current knowledge of the biology and pathology of SARS\u2010CoV and MERS\u2010CoV may provide clues for ongoing and future research efforts concerning the investigation of the 2019\u2010nCoV. In this review, we try to apply our current understanding of the pathology and pathogenesis of SARS\u2010CoV and MERS\u2010CoV for the characterization of 2019\u2010nCoV.2 PATHOLOGICAL CHANGES IN SARS\u2010CoV INFECTION\nThe available pathology data for SARS\u2010CoV infections were mainly obtained from autopsies. The predominant visceral macroscopic changes in fatal SARS\u2010CoV cases have been edematous lungs with increased gross weights and multiple areas of congestion, enlargement of lymph nodes in the pulmonary hila and the abdominal cavity, as well as a diminished spleen size and reduced spleen weights.7, 8 Morphological changes were bronchial epithelial denudation, loss of cilia, and squamous metaplasia.7 The histological feature in the early phase of pulmonary SARS\u2010CoV infections is commonly associated with acute diffuse alveolar damage, while later phases of the disease demonstrate a combination of diffuse alveolar damage and acute fibrinous and organizing pneumonia.9 Large numbers of SARS\u2010CoV particles and genomic sequences were detected within circulating lymphocytes, monocytes, and lymphoid tissues, as well as in epithelial cells of the respiratory tract, the intestinal mucosa, the epithelium of renal distal tubules, neurons in the brain, and tissue\u2010resident macrophages residing in different organs.10 Co\u2010localization of SARS\u2010CoV RNA and cellular cytokeratins within the lung was evident by immunofluorescent in situ hybridization, suggesting that pneumocytes become infected.11 Accordingly, electron microscopic examinations also showed SARS\u2010CoV virions and nucleocapsid inclusions in pneumocytes.12 Additionally, SARS\u2010CoV may occasionally be identified in the alveolar macrophages of the lung.123 PATHOGENESIS OF SARS\u2010COV INFECTION\nThe mechanisms underlying more severe pathogenicity of SARS\u2010CoV are so far not fully understood. Extensive lung damage in SARS\u2010CoV\u2010infected patients appears to be associated with high initial virus titers,13 increased monocyte, macrophage, and neutrophil infiltration in the lungs,7 and elevated levels of serum proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines.14 Therefore, the clinical deterioration of SARS\u2010CoV infection may result from a combination of direct virus\u2010induced cytopathic effects and immunopathology induced by a hyper\u2010cytokinemia or a \u201ccytokine\u2010storm.\u201d Studies of the changes in cytokine/chemokine profiles during SARS\u2010CoV infection revealed increased levels of circulating cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 (TNF\u2010\u03b1), CXCL\u201010, interleukin\u20106 (IL\u20106), and IL\u20108, likely contributed to the poor prognosis in SARS\u2010CoV infections.15\nHigh serum levels of proinflammatory cytokines (IL\u20101, IL\u20106, IL\u201012, Interferon \u03b3 [IFN\u2010\u03b3], and transforming growth factor\u2010\u03b2) and chemokines (CCL2, CXCL9, CXCL10, and IL\u20108) were found in patients with SARS with severe disease compared to individuals with uncomplicated SARS.14, 16-18 In addition, the early induction of CXCL10 and IL\u20102, as well as the subsequent hyperproduction of IL\u20106 with a coinciding lack of IL\u201010 production are thought to contribute to the immuno\u2010pathological processes involved in lung injury during SARS\u2010CoV infection.17 Additionally, robust and persistent expression of IFN\u2010\u03b1, \u2010\u03b3 and IFN\u2010stimulated genes (ISGs) accompanied early SARS sequelae.19 It has also been shown that SARS\u2010CoV infections result in a delayed expression of type I IFN.20 The delayed\u2010type I IFN signaling, which was accompanied with robust virus replication, was found to promote the accumulation of pathogenic inflammatory monocyte/macrophages, resulting in elevated lung cytokine/chemokine levels, vascular leakage, and impaired virus\u2010specific T cell responses.214 PATHOLOGICAL CHANGES ASSOCIATED WITH MERS\u2010CoV INFECTIONS\nThe understanding of pathophysiological changes caused by MERS\u2010CoV infections relies on limited numbers of autopsy and biopsy cases. Few studies indicate that the pathological features of MERS\u2010CoV infection include exudative diffuse alveolar damage with hyaline membranes, pulmonary edema, type II pneumocyte hyperplasia, interstitial pneumonia (which was predominantly lymphocytic), and multinucleate syncytial cells.22, 23 Bronchial submucosal gland necrosis was also observed.22 These bronchial lesions comprise the pathologic basis for the respiratory failure and radiologic abnormalities of MERS\u2010CoV infection.24 Target cells of the MERS\u2010CoV infection in the lung include pneumocytes, multinucleated epithelial cells, and bronchial submucosal gland cells.22 All of these cells express a multifunctional cell surface protein, called dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4; also known as CD26), constituting the primary entry receptor of MERS\u2010CoV.25 Ultrastructurally, viral particles were found in the pneumocytes, pulmonary macrophages, macrophages infiltrating the skeletal muscles, and renal proximal tubular epithelial cells.23 Consistent with the ultrastructural findings in the kidney, renal biopsies demonstrated acute tubulointerstitial nephritis and acute tubular sclerosis with proteinaceous cast formation.265 PATHOGENESIS OF MERS\u2010CoV INFECTIONS\nDPP4, the entry receptor of MERS\u2010CoV, is widely expressed on epithelial cells in the kidney, alveoli, small intestine, liver, prostate, and on activated leukocytes,27 suggesting that the range of MERS\u2010CoV tissue tropism is broader than that of any other coronavirus.28 Accordingly, MERS\u2010CoV was found to be able to infect many human immune cells, including dendritic cells,29 macrophages,30 and T cells.31 MERS\u2010CoV infections of DCs and macrophages result in robust and sustained production of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines, such as TNF\u2010\u03b1, IL\u20106, CXCL\u201010, CCL\u20102, CCL\u20103, CCL\u20105, and IL\u20108.29, 30 Proinflammatory and immune\u2010attracting capacities of these cytokines are thought to cause (or at least contribute to) immune cell infiltration into the lower respiratory tract of infected patients and the observed severe inflammation as well as tissue damage.30 MERS\u2010CoV infections of T cells results in apoptosis mediated by a combination of extrinsic and intrinsic apoptosis pathways.31 Through this mechanism, MERS\u2010CoV evades the T cell response in the peripheral blood and lymphoid organs, which may contribute to virus spread and the severe immunopathology.31 Moreover, it has been reported that MERS\u2010CoV can also induce apoptosis of both kidney and lung cells through upregulation of Smad7 and fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2) expression.326 2019\u2010nCoV\nApproximately 1 month after the onset of the outbreak, several virological and clinical aspects of the 2019\u2010nCoV and associated disease are still under investigation. However, the field is rapidly moving forward. Nevertheless, findings from several reports await independent confirmation and have to be regarded with precautions.\nThe genome of 2019\u2010nCov was sequenced very early during the outbreak.5 This enabled rapid development of point\u2010of\u2010care real\u2010time reverse transcription\u2010polymerase chain reaction diagnostic tests specific for 2019\u2010nCoV.33 The genetic sequence analysis revealed that the 2019\u2010nCoV belongs to the \u03b2\u2010coronavirus genus, with a 79.0% nucleotide identity to SARS\u2010CoV and 51.8% identity to MERS\u2010CoV.34 Furthermore, it has been reported that nCoV\u20102019 is 96% identical across the entire genome to a bat coronavirus.35 Inoculation of the 2019\u2010nCoV onto surface layers of human airway epithelial cells in vitro causes cytopathic effects and cessation of the cilium beating of the cells.5 The 2019\u2010nCoV infection was of clustering onset that is more likely to affect older males with comorbidities and can result in severe and even fatal respiratory diseases.36, 37 The major clinical symptoms resulting from 2019\u2010nCoV infection at the prodromal phase include fever, dry cough, myalgia, fatigue, and diarrhea.38 Many patients also developed dyspnea and lymphopenia. Complications of 2019\u2010nCoV infections included acute respiratory distress syndrome, RNAaemia, acute cardiac injury, and secondary (super\u2010)infections.38 All reported cases, including asymptomatic patients, had abnormal findings concerning the chest computed tomography (CT) as indicated by bilateral ground\u2010glass opacity.6, 38 The prototypical findings of chest CT images of seriously ill patients requiring intensive care unit (ICU) admission were bilateral multiple lobular and subsegmental areas of consolidation.38 Initial plasma IL\u20101\u03b2, IL\u20101R\u03b1, IL\u20107, IL\u20108, IL\u20109, IL\u201010, basic FGF, GCSF, GMCSF, IFN\u03b3, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, MIP1B, PDGF, TNF\u2010\u03b1, and vascular endothelial growth factor concentrations were higher in 2019\u2010nCoV\u2010infected patients as compared to healthy controls. Moreover, ICU patients showed higher plasma levels of IL\u20102, IL\u20107, IL\u201010, GSCF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNF\u2010\u03b1 than non\u2010ICU patients.38 These results suggest that immunopathology may also play a relevant role in the development of disease severity.7 SUMMARY AND OUTLOOK\nThe comprehensive lessons learned from the SARS\u2010CoV and MERS\u2010CoV outbreaks provide, despite their inherent tragedy, valuable experiences and insights into how to fight the 2019\u2010nCoV epidemic. Drugs which inhibit viral dissemination and disrupt viral replication may reduce the coronavirus\u2010induced direct cytopathic effects, and treatments which restrain host inflammatory responses (eg, by antibodies or compounds neutralizing cytokines or their cognate receptors, such as anti\u2010IL\u20106, anti\u2010IL\u20106R, or anti\u2010IL\u20101\u03b2), ideally in the respiratory tract only, may reduce virus\u2010triggered immune\u2010pathologies. We infer that a combination of such treatments would be the most suitable therapeutic strategy for more severe human coronavirus infections. However, we must bear in mind that currently, no specific antiviral treatment is available for SARS, MERS, and 2019\u2010nCoV, and therefore further research into the pathogenesis of human coronavirus infection is imperative for identifying appropriate therapeutic targets.ACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nWe thank all the doctors, nurses, disease control workers, and researchers who have fought bravely and ceaseless against the virus on the frontline during the 2019\u2010nCoV epidemic, some of whom lost their lives in doing so.

In Europe, the first few cases have been reported in Germany and France and most recently in Italy and Spain. The death toll from the 2019\u2010nCoV outbreak is now 305 and the number of totals recovered 348. (https://gisanddata.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6). In Italy, two cases have been registered in Rome, in a couple of Chinese tourists hosted in a Hotel placed in the center of the city. The Chinese tourists had arrived in Milan on 23 January 2020 from Wuhan, and thereafter they traveled to Rome. After relevant symptoms of coronavirus diseases, the couple has been admitted to Rome's Spallanzani Hospital, which is specialized in infectious diseases. In Italy, a state of emergency has been declared as a consequence of these two confirmed cases of infection that have been labeled as the first cases of Coronavirus transmission described in Italy.\nIn this report, phylogenetic and evolutionary analysis has been applied to characterize the 2019\u2010nCoV virus identified in Italy and better understand the transmission dynamics of the two cases diagnosed in Rome.2 MATERIALS AND METHODS\nThe dataset used for phylogenetic analysis included (n\u2009=\u200954) genomes sequences from the current 2019\u2010nCoV epidemic plus (n\u2009=\u20092) closely related bat strains (SARS\u2010like CoV) retrieved from NCBI (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/) and GISAID (https://www.gisaid.org/) databases. Sequences were aligned using MAFFT software5 and manually edited by BioEdit program v7.0.5.6\nBy IQ\u2010TREE 1.6.8 software the maximum likelihood (ML) phylogeny was reconstructed under the HKY nucleotide substitution model with 4\u2009gamma categories (HKY+G4) which were inferred in jModelTest (https://github.com/ddarriba/jmodeltest2) as the best fitting model.7\nTo investigate the temporal signal, from the ML tree, we regressed root\u2010to\u2010tip genetic distances against sample collection dates using TempEst v 1.5.1 (http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk).8 Bayesian time\u2010scaled phylogenetic analysis was performed by BEAST 1.10.4 (http://beast.community/index.html), using ML phylogeny as starting tree.9 A stringent model selection analysis by both path sampling (PS) and stepping stone (SS) procedures were performed to estimate the most appropriate molecular clock model for the Bayesian phylogenetic analysis.10 The strict molecular clock model, assuming a single rate across all phylogeny branches, and the more flexible uncorrelated relaxed molecular clock model with a lognormal rate distribution were tested.11 Both SS and PS estimators indicated the uncorrelated relaxed molecular clock (Bayes factor\u2009=\u20094.3) as the best\u2010fitted model to the dataset under analysis. The HKY+G4 codon partitioned 1\u2009+\u20092,3 substitution model and the Bayesian skyline coalescent model of population size and growth was implemented.12 Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) duplicate runs of 100 million states each, sampling every 10\u2009000 steps was computed. The convergence of MCMC chains was checked using Tracer v.1.7.1.12 Proper mixing of the MCMC was checked for ESS values greater than 200 for each estimated parameter using Tracer 1.7. Syst Biol. 2018;67(5):901\u2010904. The maximum clade credibility (MCC) trees were obtained from the tree posterior distribution using TreeAnnotator (http://beast.community/index.html) after 10% burn\u2010in.3 RESULTS\nThe viral genomes analyzed from the dataset, despite being isolated in a short time, already exhibited a substantial degree of heterogeneity with differences in 15% of the sites, 11% of which were parsimony informative. These data are coherent with the presence of sufficient phylogenetic signal for phylogenetic inference, in agreement with the low level of phylogenetic noise shown by likelihood mapping (<7%). The root\u2010to\u2010tip vs divergence plot of the full dataset showed high correlation between sampling time and genetic distance to the root of the ML tree of the available sequences (R2, .60), coherently with substantial temporal signal and the possibility to calibrate a reliable molecular clock, despite availability of relative small number of sequences and short sampling interval time.\nBayesian model selection chose the Bayesian skyline demographic model with an uncorrelated relaxed clock like the one best fitting the data. Molecular clock calibration estimated the evolutionary rate of the 2019\u2010nCoV whole\u2010genome sequences at 6.58\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u22123 substitutions site per year (95% HPD 5.2\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u22123 to 8.1\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u22123).\nIn Figure 1, the MCC tree with Bayesian phylogenetic reconstruction of 2019\u2010nCoV isolates up to day is shown. The probable origin of 2019\u2010nCoV was confirmed to be Wuhan with a state posterior probability (spp) of 0.93 datings back to the time of the most recent common ancestor of the human outbreak reported on 25th November 2019 (95% HPD, 28 September 2019; 21 December 2019). The dissemination of 2019\u2010nCoV, according to with the phylogenetic reconstruction, is confirmed to be from Wuhan, China, to Guangdong, Zhuhai (spp, 0.90), to Nonthaburi, Thailand, with an spp. of 0.90. From China, our reconstruction revealed independent importation events in the USA including Washington, Chicago, Illinois, Arizona, and Los Angeles, in Australia and in Europe including France, Germany, and Italy (spp 0.90). The viral sequence from the two Chinese tourist patients, who received a diagnosis of Coronavirus infection after their arrival in Italy on 23 January 2020 and during their stay in Rome, clustered together and grouped with sequences isolated in Europe intermixing with viral strains from China. The strains from the Chinese tourist dated back to 19 January 2020 (95% HPD: 18 January 2020; \u201c1 January 2020\u201d; Figure 1).\nFigure 1\nOpen in figure viewerPowerPoint\nMaximum clade credibility phylogeny, estimated from complete and near\u2010complete nCoV virus genomes with a molecular clock phylogenetic approach.

Colors represent different locations4 DISCUSSION\nThe early sharing of data about the Coronavirus 2019\u2010nCoV epidemic is fundamental to better understand the transmission dynamics of this virus.13 This short report is focused on the first cases of 2019\u2010nCoV infection diagnosed in two Chinese tourists upon their arrival in Italy. Bayesian phylogenetic reconstruction suggested that Chinese tourists were probably infected before their arrival in Italy, since the viral strains sequences intermixed with Chinese isolates of the epidemic dating back probably to 19 January 2020 before their arrival in Italy. Furthermore, the Chinese tourist's viral strains isolated in Italy clustered with other European strains from France, and Germany intermixing with other Chinese sequences, thus suggesting that strains introduced in Europe up to day are from China. While the outbreak seems to be centered in Wuhan, China, the genomic analysis and the phylogenetic reconstruction suggested that Wuhan, acting as a source for 2019\u2010nCoV, or as stepping stone spot, favored viral dissemination to other areas in and outside the country, which might have been influenced by the increased human mobility. Here we showed evidence of likely imported cases from China in Rome, Italy, confirming that tourist mobility was responsible for virus isolation in Italy. In conclusion, our study shows that genomic data generated in real\u2010time can be employed to assist public health laboratories in monitoring and understanding the diversity of emerging viruses. In the globalization era characterized by high human mobility, this report suggests that the spread of a new epidemic is favored, rapidly reaching other countries even in other continents as we observed during the last days. Immediate quarantine and prompt action for infection control represent the best tools to avoid further spread of infection, as the Italian government provided.", "25754": "Background\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS\u2010CoV\u20102) is an emerging disease with fatal outcomes. In this study, a fundamental knowledge gap question is to be resolved by evaluating the differences in biological and pathogenic aspects of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 and the changes in SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 in comparison with the two prior major COV epidemics, SARS and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronaviruses.Methods\nThe genome composition, nucleotide analysis, codon usage indices, relative synonymous codons usage, and effective number of codons (ENc) were analyzed in the four structural genes; Spike (S), Envelope (E), membrane (M), and Nucleocapsid (N) genes, and two of the most important nonstructural genes comprising RNA\u2010dependent RNA polymerase and main protease (Mpro) of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102, Beta\u2010CoV from pangolins, bat SARS, MERS, and SARS CoVs.Results\nSARS\u2010CoV\u20102 prefers pyrimidine rich codons to purines. Most high\u2010frequency codons were ending with A or T, while the low frequency and rare codons were ending with G or C. SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 structural proteins showed 5 to 20 lower ENc values, compared with SARS, bat SARS, and MERS CoVs. This implies higher codon bias and higher gene expression efficiency of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 structural proteins. SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 encoded the highest number of over\u2010biased and negatively biased codons. Pangolin Beta\u2010CoV showed little differences with SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 ENc values, compared with SARS, bat SARS, and MERS CoV.Conclusion\nExtreme bias and lower ENc values of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102, especially in Spike, Envelope, and Mpro genes, are suggestive for higher gene expression efficiency, compared with SARS, bat SARS, and MERS CoVs.1 INTRODUCTION\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS\u2010CoV\u20102) is a new emerging fatal disease emerged in Wuhan, China in December 2019.1, 2 This is the third CoV epidemic after SARS and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) CoV outbreaks. Initial phylogenetic analysis indicates the formation of a common cluster with bat SARS\u2010like CoV isolated in 2015.3 Structural studies showed the close relation of the receptor\u2010binding domain of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 with SARS CoV.4 Three major CoV epidemics were evolved during the past few decades. The first epidemic was SARS CoV in 2003.5 Evidence was provided that SARS CoV was raised from an animal source including an intermediate host animal, which transmitted the virus from a bat carrier to humans.6 About a decade later, MERS CoV was first identified in the Arabian Peninsula.7 Lastly, in December 2019, the third epidemic emerged in Wuhan, China.\nCoVs are enveloped, positive\u2010stranded RNA viruses possessing a comparatively large genome approaching 30\u2009kb and comprising four structural proteins, namely, spike (S), nucleocapsid (N) envelope (E), and membrane (M).8 The S protein is responsible for virus attachment to the receptor and fusion with cell membrane.9, 10 The N protein interacts with the viral RNA to form the ribonucleoprotein.11 The E protein helps in virions assembly and comprises ion channel actions12; the M protein shares in the assembly of new virus particles.13 CoV genome is organized in 10 open\u2010reading frames (ORFs).14 The 5\u2032 encodes ORF1a and ORF1b, which are translated to give large polyproteins 1a and 1b (polyprotein AB in MERS CoV), which encodes a set of nonstructural protein. The CoV polyprotein is processed by the main protease and papain\u2010like protease to yield the nonstructural proteins.\nAnalysis of genome structure and composition is a part of studies of understanding virus evolution and adaptation to host.15, 16 Some amino acids are encoded by one codon, while others are encoded by several alternative codons knows as synonymous codons.17 Codon bias means a preference for one codon over another during protein translation and affects translation efficiency, which differs from one organism to another.18, 19\nIn this study, the newly emerged fatal SARS\u2010CoV\u20102, the four structural genes, and two most important nonstructural genes were evaluated for their nucleotide composition, preferred codons, relative synonymous codons usage (RSCU), and positively and negatively biased codons. This investigation will cover a knowledge gap in our understanding of mechanisms of viral genome evolution, the underlying codon composition, and codon usage preferences in comparison with the most recent CoV epidemic viral infections. The structural genes comprises the S, E, M, and N genes, while the nonstructural genes include the RNA\u2010dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) and main protease (Mpro) genes.2 MATERIALS AND METHODS\n2.1 Gene data collection and analytical programs\nSARS\u2010CoV\u20102 and Pangolins Beta\u2010CoV complete genomes sequences were downloaded either from the NCBI GenBank or GISAID (https://www.gisaid.org/). The sequences of SARS CoV, bat SARS CoV, MERS CoV were retrieved from the gene databases at NCBI.\nThe CLC Genomics Workbench 12.0 (QIAGEN, Aarhus, Denmark) was used to handle the sequences.20 The patterns of codon usage were assessed using CodonW 1.4.2.21\n2.2 Nucleotide composition and codon usage parameters\nThe nucleotide composition of the four structure genes, S, E, M, and N, were analyzed to reveal the nucleotides (A, T, G, and C) percentages. A/T, G/C percentage, the percentage of G or C nucleotides at the first position of codons (GC1), the percentage of each nucleotide at the third position of codons, the percentage of G or C nucleotides at the third position of codons (GC3) were calculated.\n2.3 Relative synonymous codons usage\nRSCU is calculated by dividing the expected frequencies of synonymous codon against their observed frequencies, according to Equation (1)22:\n(1)\nwhere Xij implies the observed number of codons used and ni stands for the sum of synonymous codons. The raw data for RSCU are provided in the Supporting Information Material.\n2.4 The effective number of codons\nENc values range from 20 to 61. The obtained ENc value can be used to conclude the codon usage bias. An ENc value of <35 indicates strong codon usage bias due to lower number of codons used in protein translation. Higher ENc value indicates low codon usage bias. The raw data for ENc are provided in the Supporting Information Material.3 RESULTS\n3.1 Nucleotide compositions of the non structural proteins of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102, SARS CoV, bat CoV, and MERS CoV\nIn S gene, T nucleotides were the most predominant (32%\u201034%) followed by A (25%\u201029%). SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 showed the lowest GC% (37%) and the highest AT% (63%), compared with bat SARS, MERS, and SARS CoV. In addition, SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 has the lowest percentage of G/C nucleotides at the third position of codons followed by pangolins Beta\u2010CoV, which showed the highest A3s. In all of the examined CoVs, the nucleotide percentages in the S gene were in the following order: T>A>C>G. In NT3s, the T3s and G3s were the most and the least frequent nucleotides, respectively (Table 1).\nTable 1.

SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 showed the lowest GC% (38.2%) and the highest AT% (63%), compared with bat SARS, MERS, and SARS CoV. In addition, SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 has the lowest frequency of G/C nucleotides. In all of the examined dCoVs, the nucleotide percentages in the E gene were in the following order: T>A>C>G. In NT3s, the T3s and G3s were the most and the least frequent nucleotides, respectively.\nIn the N gene, A nucleotides were the most predominant (29.6%\u201031.7%) followed by C (25%\u201029%). There was little or no differences in GC% and AT% between the CoVs with a conserved tendency for higher AT%. The nucleotide percentages in the N gene were in the following order: A>C>G>T for SARS\u2010CoV\u20102, SARS, and bat SARS CoVs, while MERS CoV showed a revised order of A>C>T>G. In NT3s, the T3s and G3s were the most and the least frequent nucleotides, respectively.\nIn the M gene, T nucleotides were the most predominant (29.9%\u201031.9%) followed by A (24.4%\u201025.6%). SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 showed the lowest GC% (42.6%) and the highest AT% (57.4%), compared with bat SARS, MERS, and SARS CoV. In addition, SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 and pangolins Beta\u2010CoV showed slightly lower G/C nucleotides at the third position of codons. In all of the examined CoVs, the nucleotide percentages in the M gene were in the following order: T>A>C>G. In NT3s, similar to other structural genes, the T3s and G3s were the most and the least frequent nucleotides, respectively.\nIn RdRP, T and A nucleotides were the most predominant nucleotides. In addition, SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 showed the highest T3s and the lowest G3s (Table 2). In contrast, pangolins Beta\u2010CoV and MERS CoV showed the lowest A3s and the highest G3s frequencies. Therefore, similar to structural genes, RdRP contained pyrimidine nucleotides more frequent than purines. For Mpro, there is a conserved profile of general preference for T3s and low frequencies for G3s. Both SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 and pangolin Beta\u2010CoV showed the lowest G3s frequencies.\nTable 2.

The tables are colored by a color scheme to denote the levels of codon usage bias. A value of RSCU =1 means that the observed frequency of codon is equivalent to the predictable frequency and indicating the lack of any codon usage bias. The underrepresented or negatively biased codons denote RSCU <0.6 (blue color), the overexpressed or positively biased codons with RSCU >0.6 (red color). The range between 0.6 and 1.6 conforms to the nonbiased codons.\nTable 3. RSCU values of structural genes (S and E) from SARS\u2010CoV\u20102, pangolins Beta\u2010CoV, SARS CoV, Bat CoV, and MERS CoV\nAbbreviations: CoV, coronavirus; MERS, Middle East respiratory syndrome; RSCU, relative synonymous codons usage; SARS, severe acute respiratory syndrome.\nTable 4. RSCU values of structural genes (M and N genes) from SARS\u2010CoV\u20102, pangolins Beta\u2010CoV, SARS CoV, Bat CoV, and MERS CoV\nAbbreviations: CoV, coronavirus; MERS, Middle East respiratory syndrome; RSCU, relative synonymous codons usage; SARS, severe acute respiratory syndrome.\nIn the S gene, the over\u2010biased codons, SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 showed the highest number of over\u2010biased codons (10 codons), including CTT, ATT, GTT, TCT, CCT, CCA, ACT, GCT, AGA, and GGT. All of these codons contained A3s or T3s. In contrast, pangolin Beta\u2010CoV, SARS CoV, bat SARS CoV, and MERS CoV showed 8, 8, 9, and 8 over\u2010biased codons, respectively (Table 3). Therefore, SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 has the largest number of over\u2010biased codons. The over\u2010biased codons were similar to that provided for SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 except for CCA and ACT for pangolin Beta\u2010CoV, CCA, and GGT for SARS CoV, CCA for bat SARS CoV and ATT and CCA for MERS CoV.\nIn the N gene, the over\u2010biased codons, SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 showed the highest number of over\u2010biased codons (six codons), including TTG, CTT, ATT, ACT, GCT, and AGA. In contrast, pangolin Beta\u2010CoV, SARS CoV, bat SARS CoV, and MERS CoV showed 4, 4, 4, and 5 over\u2010biased codons, respectively (Table 4). Therefore, SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 has the largest number of over\u2010biased codons in the N gene. The over\u2010biased codons were similar to that provided for SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 except TTG for pangolin Beta\u2010CoV, TTG, and CTT for SARS TTG and CTT for bat SARS CoV and TTG for MERS CoV. For MERS CoV, the over\u2010biased codons were slightly different and included CTT, ATT, TCT ACT, GCT, TAC, and AGA.\nIn the M gene, the over\u2010biased codons were CTT, ATT, GTA, GCT, CCA, GAC, GAA, TGT, CGT, and GGA for SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 (10 codons), CTT, ATT, TCT, TCA, GCT, CCA, and GGA for pangolin Beta\u2010CoV (seven codons), CTT, ATT, GTA, GCT, CCA, GAC, TGT, and CGT for SARS CoV and bat SARS CoV (eight codons), CTT, ATT, GTA, GCT, CCA, GAC, TGT, GGT, and CGT for MERS CoV (nine codons). GGA and GAA codons were nonbiased codons in all coronaviruses except for the SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 and pangolin Beta\u2010CoV were over\u2010biased. In the E gene, the codon usage could be biased by the short length of the E gene that favors excluding its delivered RSCU values.\nThe frequent negatively biased codons among CoVs include CTG, TCG, AGC, CCG, ACC, ACG, GCG, CGC, and GGG in the S gene, ATA, GTA, TGC, GCG, TGT, AGG and TGC in the N gene and ATA, TGC, and CCC in the M gene.\nThe number of over\u2010biased and negatively biased codons were compared in SARS\u2010CoV\u20102, pangolin Beta\u2010CoV, SARS CoV, Bat CoV, and MERS CoV. SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 almost coding the highest number of over\u2010biased and negatively biased codons among all of the structural proteins. In the S gene, SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 bears 12 and 19 over\u2010biased and negatively biased codons, respectively. The SARS\u2010CoV\u20102/SARS over\u2010biased codons ratio was 1.2, 1.14, and 1.44 for S, N, and M genes, respectively. In addition, The SARS\u2010CoV\u20102/SARS negatively biased codons ratio was 1, 1.2, and 1.44 for S, N, and M genes, respectively. Therefore, the SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 showed the highest number of extreme codon usage patterns of over\u2010 or under\u2010biased codons, followed by SARS CoV. The gap between SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 and SARS CoVs is more tighter than the gap of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 or SARS CoV and the bat SARS CoV, which showed a much lower number of biased codons in comparison with the other viruses. MERS CoV showed a higher number of biased codons only in the N gene, compared with SARS and SARS\u2010CoV\u20102.\nThe structural genes undertook a homogenous profile of codon usage with little differences among the genes. In contrast, NSP as RdRP and Mpro showed larger variations. RdRP showed three over\u2010biased codons and eight common under\u2010biased codons. SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 and pangolin Beta\u2010CoV showed the highest number of under\u2010biased codons (12 codons). Compared to 10 codons in SARS and bat SARS and five codons in MERS CoV (Table S1).\nIn Mpro, the number of over\u2010 and under\u2010biased genes were 11, 10, 8, 8, 6 and 15, 15, 14, 11, and 9 for SARS\u2010CoV\u20102, pangolin Beta\u2010CoV, SARS, bat SARS, and MERS CoVs, respectively. This agrees with the general predicted highest number of biased codons in SARS\u2010CoV\u20102.\n3.3 Effective number of codons\nENc implies the effective number of codons and can be used as a measure of codon usage bias. ENc values range from 20 to 61. As the ENc value increases, the codon usage bias is lower. Low ENc value indicates high codon usage bias.\nSARS\u2010CoV\u20102 showed the lowest ENc value for all nonstructural and structural genes, compared with pangolins Beta\u2010CoV, SARS, and bat SARS CoVs (Figure 1). MERS CoV has the lowest ENc value for N and RdRP. The differences between ENc values between SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 and pangolins Beta\u2010CoV were 0.6, 4.2, 2.9, 0.7, and 0.7 for S, E, M, N, RdRP, and Mpro. These values were the lowest differences compared with the other CoVs.\nFigure 1\nOpen in figure viewerPowerPoint\nEffective number of codons values for structural (S, E, M, N) and nonstructural genes (RNA\u2010dependent RNA polymerase and main protease genes) from SARS\u2010CoV\u20102, pangolins Beta\u2010CoV, SARS CoV, Bat CoV, and MERS CoV.

In addition, A or T nucleotides were the most predominant nucleotides at the 3rd position of codons. This is in agreement with the previous studies of CoVs.25, 31\nRNA viruses had evolved high ENc value (>35), implying low codon bias to adapt a wide range of hosts with various codon usage preferences.29 ENc values above 50, in general, mean low codon usage bias. The codon usage data indicated lower number of ENc values of the SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 compared with SARS, bat SARS, and pangolin CoV. This indicates a higher codon usage bias of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102. Within these CoVs, pangolin CoV had the least ENc differences.\nThere is a negative correlation between the ENc value and codon usage bias. ENc values indicate higher codon usage bias in SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 compared with SARS and MERS CoVs, due to lower ENc values, which is mostly observed in S, E, and M genes and to a lesser extent in N and RdRP genes. In SARS, bat SARS, and MERS CoVs E gene, ENc was >60, while in SARS\u2010CoV\u20102, the ENc value was decreased by an amount of 18 to be no more than 42. Similarly, the M gene ENc value in SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 was decreased by an amount of 3 to 5. Genes with low expression levels have high ENc values and more rare codons.32 The expression of highly biased genes is considered as high.33 The relative expression can be concluded from the ENc value, where small ENc value indicates higher bias and a generally higher level of expression.34 Thus, the small ENc value is suggesting for higher gene expression. The lower observed ENc, especially for Spike and Envelope genes, values for SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 structural genes are indicative for higher gene expression potency.ACKNOWLEDGMENT\nThe authors acknowledge the Deanship of Scientific Research at King Faisal University for the financial support under Research Groups track (Grant No. 1811016).", "25897": "", "25733": "1 INTRODUCTION\nSince the outbreak of the novel coronavirus (2019\u2010nCoV), also known as novel coronary pneumonia (NCP) in January 2020, a number of clinical trials for treatment have been registered in China. Although the time span of study registration was less than 2 weeks (30 January 2020 to 12 February 2020), subtle changes in the classification of registered trials could be seen from the development of the epidemic, including that the proportion of studies targeting critically ill patients had gradually increased in the latter period, and patients' physical and psychological rehabilitation had also received attention. Based on the current registered trials, together with the epidemic situation in China and published literatures of 2019\u2010nCoV, we made a preliminary assessment on the prospects of therapy for 2019\u2010nCoV and the availability of drugs in the short term.2 REVIEW OF CLINICAL STUDIES AND PUBLICATIONS\nWe used \u201cnovel coronavirus\u201d to search in the Chinese Clinical Trial Register and \u201c2019\u2010nCoV\u201d in clinicaltrials.gov. A total of 107 clinical trials had been registered by Chinese researchers, of which 90 were registered in the Chinese Clinical Trial Register and 17 in clinicaltrial.gov by 14 February 2020. Almost all trials were investigator\u2010initiated. Most of the trials involved clinical therapy and a small part of pathogenesis research and 87 trials were related to drug interventions. More than 20 trials were conducted in Wuhan, the most severely affected area (Figure 1). Most of them were short\u2010term clinical trials, with the planned study period of 1 to 11 months, and about a quarter of them were within 6 months.\nFigure 1\nOpen in figure viewerPowerPoint\nThe location distribution for clinical trial of 2019\u2010nCoV. nCoV, novel coronavirus\nWe used \u201cnovel coronavirus AND China\u201d to search on PubMed website by 14 February 2020, and a total of 81 literatures for 2019\u2010nCoV were retrieved after excluding the results like news and comments. Most of the literatures were focusing on the description of epidemiology and clinical characteristics of 2019\u2010nCoV, while studies of diagnosis (imaging, nucleic acid detection) and treatment were limited. In terms of diagnosis, seven literatures were published in Radiology to conduct computed tomography analysis for more than 80 patients to summarize the imaging characteristics of NCP.1 In addition, there were two literatures on nucleic acid detection of 2019\u2010nCoV.2 It should be noted that there was no shortage of institutions for nucleic acid detection and even a few of them had been approved by the government, however, the data to prove the sensitivity and consistency were still lacking. And the New England Journal published the first clinical evidence of tumor patients in the outbreak of 2019\u2010nCoV, supporting that tumor patients may be more susceptible to infection due to the influence of malignant tumor, chemoradiotherapy, surgery, and other factors on immune status.3 In terms of treatment, no successful randomized controlled trial (RCT) had been published, which also reflected the bottleneck of current treatment. In general, finding effective targeted drugs remains an urgent work.\nIn the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) period 17 years ago, our capacity to conduct clinical trial on drugs was still relatively weak in China, and there was also a lack of awareness and registration conditions for clinical trials. We attempted to retrieve the registered trials during SARS period from the first patient infected with SARS\u2010CoV in November 2002 to the complete end of the epidemic in July 2003, but failed. Therefore, only incomplete statistics based on literatures for SARS\u2010CoV could be obtained. A total of 54 literatures of drug studies were retrieved,4 of which 83% were retrospectively analyzed, with few prospective studies. The selection of the study drugs was similar to that of 2019\u2010nCoV, with ribavirin, lopinavir, interferon, and glucocorticoids as the main drugs. Vaccine studies were also launched; however, the follow\u2010up data were not reported.\nCompared with that in the SARS period, the ability and consciousness of carrying out clinical trials in China during the period of 2019\u2010nCoV were significantly improved. Meanwhile, the quality of clinical trials and the level of evidence will provide important evidence\u2010based data for the clinical diagnosis and treatment for 2019\u2010nCoV.3 CLASSIFICATION OF EXPERIMENTAL DRUGS\nThe experimental drugs included Western medicine, including antiviral drugs, antimalarial drugs, and biotherapy (interferon, stem cell therapy, and immune regulation therapy, etc), and traditional Chinese medicine, and studies of glucocorticoids and plasma also accounted for small proportion (Figure 2 and Table 1). The number of trials on traditional Chinese medicine was much higher than that of the treatment of previous diseases, which meant that Western medicine still lacked effectiveness in antivirus therapy. Almost all drugs were old, and most of them had already been brought to the market for other indications, and some drugs were in phase II clinical trials for infectious diseases caused by other viruses.\nFigure 2\nOpen in figure viewerPowerPoint\nThe classification of experimental drugs for 2019\u2010nCoV. nCoV, novel coronavirus\nTable 1.

and https://clinicaltrials.gov/.\nProspective multicenter\u2010controlled studies for traditional Chinese medicine, like Shuanghuanglian and Lianhua Qingwen, have been conducted. At the same time, the trials combining traditional Chinese and Western medicine occupied a high proportion. Considering that 2019\u2010nCoV might cause cytokine release syndrome (CRS), patients in the studies of traditional Chinese medicine could also receive Western medicine which was a very important therapy for them.\nAntiviral drugs still drew the most attention,5, 6 including remdesivir, ASC09, lopinavir/ritonavir, arbidol, as well as the traditional biological agents such as interferon\u2010alpha and thymosin alpha\u20101. At the same time, three studies for glucocorticoids were launched, and two of them recruited patients with severe pneumonia. In addition, the traditional antimalarial drugs\u2014chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine\u2014were also widely studied.\nIt was encouraging that two important drugs registered clinical studies for NCP. As more and more evidence showed that the mechanism of severe pneumonia may be associated with CRS caused by virus infection, tocilizumab, which was the most effective way to inhibit CRS in the chimeric antigen receptor T\u2010cell therapy, has been the focus of recent academic discussion. A multicenter RCT for the efficacy and safety of tocilizumab in the treatment of NCP has been registered on 14 February 2020. Simultaneously, the Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital registered a trial to explore the efficacy of PD\u20101 inhibitor (carrizumab)\u2014a new drug for tumor treatment\u2014for severe NCP with lymphocytopenia, and this was the first immune checkpoint inhibitor used in the study of NCP. The results of the two studies were very worthy of attention.\nThe studies for the effects of plasma from recovered patients are ongoing, which is promising. Besides, vaccines are an effective way to prevent and reduce the harm of viruses,7 and a number of pharmaceutical institutions around the world have started the research for 2019\u2010nCoV messenger RNA vaccine, which could enter clinical phase as early as April 2020.\nIn general, compared with that in SARS period, there are more options for the treatment of 2019\u2010nCOV, including more antiviral drugs, such as remdesivir, ASC09, and arbidol. Although previous studies had shown that chloroquine could inhibit SARS\u2010CoV,8 the conclusion remained at the cellular level study and have not entered the clinical stage. Besides, tocilizumab and carrizumab mentioned above might provide patients with more opportunities for treatment.4 THE AVAILABILITY OF DRUGS IN THE SHORT TERM FROM THE TIME OF CLINICAL TRIAL\nMost of the trials will continue over a period of about 1 year (Table 1), which means that the results of these studies are likely to be of limited help in the current epidemic, with more value for prevention and treatment in the future. However, the epidemic situation is urgent and the number of patients is huge with a certain critically ill proportion. Therefore, the availability of effective experimental drugs in the short\u2010term may be the most concerned. According to the retrieved data, more than 20 studies would be completed within 6 months, and some important drugs like remdesivir, ASC09, lopinavir, ritonavir, chloroquine, and glucocorticoids might be completed within 4 months. The RCT of remdesivir for severe NCP and the mild to moderate NCP carried out by China\u2010Japan Friendship Hospital respectively, were expected to be completed by the end of April or early May 2020 (Table 1).\nIf these trials could be completed on schedule or ahead of schedule with the endpoint achieved, significant impact would be made on the control and prognosis of 2019\u2010nCoV. The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine carried out two open\u2010label, multicenter RCT to evaluate and compare the safety and efficiency of ASC09/ritonavir vs lopinavir/ritonavir and baloxavir marboxil vs favipiravir vs lopinavir\u2010ritonavir for confirmed cases of NCP, respectively (Table 1). And the studies were expected to be completed by 03 June 2020 and 31 May 2020, respectively. Although the epidemic may be coming to an end at that time, the drugs could be approved for treatment in advance with the preliminary effective results of the interim research (optimistic forecast by March 2020). At the same time, researchers have also carried out the trials for traditional Chinese medicine with a short study period, which might also provide preliminary efficacy and safety data and provide important options for clinical treatment.\nBesides, it has been reported that remdesivir, chloroquine phosphate, and farpiravir showed preliminary efficacy in clinical studies,9 which is encouraging for medical staff and patients who are still in the critical stage of the epidemic.5 DIFFERENCES IN OPTIMAL STUDY ENDPOINTS\nThere were significant differences in the primary endpoint selected in the retrieved studies, including improvement in clinical symptoms, negative nucleic acid detection, and survival, with no clear conclusion for which one of them was the most appropriate. The two major concerns of antiviral therapy are certainly: one is prognosis of treatment: for mild to moderate patients, reducing critical illness rate is the primary objective; and for severe or critical illness patients, reducing mortality or improving recovery of pulmonary function matters more, which are indicators of efficacy that can be evaluated in the near future. The other is the rate and time for the virus to turn negative, which is related to patient's speed of recovery and prevention of the virus transmission. Therefore, improvement of clinical symptoms is more important to reduce the incidence of severe illness and mortality, and the detection of virus nucleic acid has a longer term significance for reducing transmission. However, there were several cases reported that patients with turning negative virus nucleic acid detection after treatment became positive again after a period of time. Therefore, the frequency and time interval of detection after turning negative need to be further discussed. If the frequency of detection is increased or the interval is prolonged, combined with the improvement of clinical symptoms, the disease progression could be more accurately estimated, and whether the patient still carries the virus and is infectious could be further determined.\nIn addition, in a public health emergency, the race against the epidemic forces us to consider an earlier effective endpoint of as a surrogate endpoint for mortality to accelerate the process of clinical trials. For example, two studies of remdesivir (NCT04252664, NCT 04257656) used time to clinical recovery (TTCR) and time to clinical improvement (TTCI) as primary endpoint, respectively, instead of virus nucleic acid detection or survival status of severe patients. The former is based on the patient's body temperature, breathing rate, oxygen saturation, and the improvement of clinical symptoms; the latter is based on the time for improvement of the clinical status. And given the relatively low mortality rate of about 2% for NCP at present, the choices of endpoint were based more on recommendations for influenza drug research, in which mortality is not the primary endpoint in most studies. Besides, TTCR or TTCI as a surrogate endpoint required smaller sample sizes than the other dichotomous endpoints (such as disease control rate). And it should be emphasized that the choice should be dependent on the opinions and decisions of the clinical medicine.\nBased on the analysis of the current situation of the epidemic in China, effective quarantine measures have been carried out throughout the country, however, a large number of patients are in urgent need of treatment with a significant proportion of critically ill patients. We support that improvement of clinical symptoms and prognosis of disease should be used as the most important indicators to evaluate the short\u2010term efficacy of experimental drugs. And once supported by interim research data, the drugs should be applied early.\nBesides, the current severe illness rate is estimated to be about 15%. It is unclear whether some of these patients will have long\u2010term recovery problems such as impaired lung function or other organ dysfunction, which should be paid attention to and the study should be initiated to confirm.\nTo carry out a large number of clinical trials so rapidly is also worrying. Due to the urgency, the theoretical bases of some trials were needed to be discussed more comprehensively, and the designs might not be reasonable enough. Whether these factors will increase the risk of the patients is also a matter which should be treated with caution in the research.\nCompared with the SARS epidemic period 17 years ago, China had a stronger ability to conduct new drug clinical trials independently in an emergency event. However, there is still no effective therapy for virus infection. When expecting that these studies can provide effective treatment for NCP in China, we need to carry out these trials carefully to ensure the safety of the patients.CONFLICT OF INTERESTS\nThe authors declare that there are no conflict of interests.", "25706": "Uncertainties over the Wuhan 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019\u2010nCoV), which has killed at least 1,775 people and sickened more than 70,000 as of February 17,1 has interrupted global trade and supply chains, depressing asset prices, and forced multinational businesses to make hard decisions with limited information.\nWuhan has been identified as a principal financial hub for central China. It is a significant transportation and trade center, hosting the headquarters of the nation's major local steel and vehicle makers. The city also serves as home to more than 300 factories of the world's best 500 companies, including Microsoft, German software company SAP, and French car maker Groupe PSA.2 In recent years, its monetary development has been recorded to have surpassed China's national growth, with a GDP growth of 7.8% in 20192 as against the national average of 6.1%.3 After the spreading of the recent viral disease, numerous firms have now evacuated their expat workers from the city and temporarily halted business activities. The strict travel restrictions that have been enforced in Wuhan and different urban communities in Hubei are expected to have ripple effects throughout China and beyond, as far as trade is concerned. Among the industries that would be negatively impacted, retail, tourism, and hospitality sectors are likely to be most affected.4\nWith over 70\u2009000 movie theatres closed down in mainland China,5 and several airlines canceling flights to and from China \u2013 disrupting tourism and other business activities \u2013 the economic impact of the novel coronavirus is already extending beyond the borders of Hubei. This impact is quite obvious in the rattled stock market.6-8 It is quite interesting how the lockdown of a province with a population just a bit less than that of France or the UK has threatened to be a blow to the global economy. This could be said to be amplified by the thorough integration of China, the second\u2010largest economy behind the US, with the rest of the world. During the SARS\u2010CoV outbreak in China from 2002 to 2003, the global economy was estimated to have lost roughly $40 billion.9 Currently, as China has an economy 8 to 9 times larger than it had during the SARS epidemic, and is even more connected to the rest of the world, experts believe that the total impact of the 2019\u2010nCoV on global economy could be quite huge.4 As China now contributes approximately 16.3% of the world's GDP, the country has been the main growth driver worldwide, with the IMF estimating that China alone accounted for 39% of global economic growth in 2019.10 This implies that any slowdown in the nation's economy could likely send waves across the global economy.11 Figure 1 presents the growth of China's GDP and its share of the global GDP from 2003 to 2018.\nFigure 1\nOpen in figure viewerPowerPoint\nGrowtaaah of China's GDP and its shares in global GDP11\nSource: World Bank, OECD\nWhen China reopened its essential businesses on Monday, February 3, 2020, the markets dropped sharply in value due to the extended Lunar New Year holidays. The benchmark Shanghai Composite Index fell 7.7%, shedding about $375 billion in market value in its steepest 1\u2010day decline since August 2015. The Shenzhen Composite also experienced an 8.4% decline in value. Other business sectors, retail, consumer services, and transportation stocks too led the declines.12\nAccording to IHS Markit Automotive, 11 of the Chinese provinces which are on strict lockdown account for more than two\u2010thirds of vehicle production in the country. These provinces equally supply auto\u2010parts to carmakers in the US, Europe, and South Korea. If the manufacturing companies remain idle until February 10, 2020, the experts believe that there could be production loss of about 350\u2009000 units. This figure could skyrocket to over 1.7 million units if the outbreak situation continues until mid\u2010March, equating to about 32.3% decline from precrisis expectations.13 Similarly, S&P believes the nation's auto\u2010parts production could suffer up to a 50% decline. Some carmakers have already expressed concerns over the shortage of car parts. Hyundai has reported the shutdown of its domestic factories after running out of parts from China. The managers of various carmakers in the US and Europe have also expressed concerns over the likely disruptions in business if China does not resume a full supply of parts to them within a week.14 According to industry consultant LMC Automotive, China's auto market will shrink 3% to 5% in 2020 if the coronavirus outbreak continues into the second quarter.15\nAside the automotive industry, tourism across the world has been affected gravely due to the outbreak, as China is recognized by the United Nation Tourism Organization (UNWTO) as a true leader in global tourism, both as a source market and as a leading destination.16 The China Outbound Tourism Research Institute observed that 6.3 million Chinese tourists traveled abroad during the 2019 Lunar New Year holiday, generating travel revenue of around $73 billion, but the figures have reduced drastically in 2020.17 The impact on tourism beyond China is also significant, according to reliable sources. Due to Chinese tours being canceled and a general recession in domestic and international travelers, Vietnam's tourist industry is expected to lose up to $7.7 billion in the first 3 months of this year.15 As Chinese arrivals in Thailand are expected to decline by 80% in the first 4 months of 2020, the governor of the Tourism Authority of Thailand (TAT) estimates that the nation could loss $3.1 billion in revenue.18 Aside Vietnam and Thailand, the tourism industries of Indonesia, Singapore, South Korea, Malaysia, Cambodia, Hong Kong, Japan, Australia, and many more countries across the world are expected to be hit by the outbreak.19\nWhen the loss of commerce, trade, tourism, and major impacts on global supply chains are taken into consideration, the economic impacts of the outbreak will be vast both within China and globally. A market diagnosis completed by Bloomberg economists, concludes that China's first\u2010quarter GDP growth may slip to 4.5% year\u2010on\u2010year. According to an estimated modelling by the same experts, to analyze the expected losses to different countries across the world, the global GDP is likely to decline by roughly 0.42% in first quarter of the year due to the outbreak. This is illustrated in Figure 2. That notwithstanding, the Bloomberg economists believe that it is too early to tell the full impact of the fatal disease since the infection has not attained its peak yet.20\nFigure 2\nOpen in figure viewerPowerPoint\nPercentage point deviation in year\u2010on\u2010year growth from Q1 202020\nSource: Bloomberg Economics\nSome capital economists, however, estimate that, without urgent global actions to curtail the Wuhan 2019\u2010nCoV within the shortest possible time, China is expected to lose up to $62 billion21 in the first quarter of the year, while the world is likely to lose over $280 billion within the same period.15 This conclusion compares closely to the World Banks estimation that even a weaker flu pandemic, such as the 2009 H1N1 viruses, could still wipe 0.5% off global GDP, which amounts to approximately $300 billion.22", "25701": "1 INTRODUCTION\nOn 30 January 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the current outbreak of the novel coronavirus 2019\u2010nCoV, which was first detected in the Chinese city of Wuhan on 31 December 2019, a \u201cpublic health emergency of international concern\u201d\u2014an alarm it reserves for events that pose a risk to multiple countries and which requires a coordinated international response. Previous studies have confirmed that this virus can spread from person to person after identifying clusters of cases among families, as well as transmission from patients to healthcare workers.1, 2 As of 3 February 2020, there have been 20\u2009438 cases of 2019\u2010nCoV confirmed in mainland China, including 2788 serious, 425 deaths, and 632 discharged, as well as 15 in Hong Kong, 8 in Macao, and 10 in Taiwan. More than 150 cases had also been confirmed in at least 18 other countries on four continents. In epidemiological studies, the basic reproductive number (R0) is defined as the possible number of infection cases generated from a single infected person at a particular time point during an outbreak and is often used to describe transmission dynamics over the course of a disease epidemic. On the basis of earlier research, the initial R0 was estimated to be 2.2 (95% confidence interval, 1.4 to 3.9) among the first 425 patients with 2019\u2010nCoV\u2010induced pneumonia,2 consistent with the preliminary estimate of 1.4 to 2.5 presented by the WHO during their International Health Regulations Emergency Committee meeting on the 2019\u2010nCoV outbreak. It is possible that subsequent control measures, such as the strict travel restrictions in Wuhan and China as well as overseas, may change or reduce the R0 value over the course of the virus outbreak. Of note, the coronaviridae family not only includes 2019\u2010nCoV, but also severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS\u2010CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS\u2010CoV), and the common cold viruses in immunocompetent individuals (eg, 229E, OC43, NL63, and HKU1).3 The SARS\u2010CoV pathogen was responsible for the 2002\u20102003 outbreak of SARS in Guangdong Province, China, which resulted in more than 8000 cases and 774 deaths in 37 countries worldwide.4-6 The MERS\u2010CoV pathogen was responsible for the 2012 outbreak of MERS, which resulted in 2494 cases and 858 deaths in 27 countries worldwide.7, 8 Notably, both SARS\u2010CoV and MERS\u2010CoV are zoonotic in origin, with prior studies revealing bats to be the animal host source,9-12 and masked palm civets13-15 and camels16, 17 to be the intermediate animal hosts (between bats and humans) of the two diseases, respectively. Recent research has also reported that the 2019\u2010nCoV virus is 96% identical at the genome level to a previously detected bat coronavirus, which belongs to a SARS\u2010related coronavirus species (ie, SARS\u2010CoV).18 Like SARS\u2010CoV, MERS\u2010CoV, and many other coronaviruses, 2019\u2010nCoV likely originated in bats, but it remains unclear whether an intermediary animal host was involved before the virus jumped to humans. As reported in earlier research, however, although bats could be the original host of 2019\u2010nCoV, the virus may have initially been transmitted to an intermediate animal host sold at the Wuhan Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, thus facilitating the emergence of 2019\u2010nCoV in humans.19\nIn the present study, we investigated the time origin and genetic diversity of 2019\u2010nCoV in humans based on 32 genomes of virus strains sampled from China, Thailand, and the USA with known sampling dates between 24 December 2019 and 23 January 2020. We conducted a comprehensive genetic analysis of four 2019\u2010nCoV genome sequence datasets (ie, \u201cdataset_14,\u201d \u201cdataset_24,\u201d \u201cdataset_30,\u201d and \u201cdataset_32\u201d), and elucidated the transmission dynamics and evolutionary history of the virus outbreak in China, Thailand, and the USA. These analyses should extend our understanding of the origins and dynamics of the 2019\u2010nCoV outbreak in China and elsewhere.2 MATERIALS AND METHODS\n2.1 Collation of 2019\u2010nCoV genome datasets\nAs of 28 January 2020, 33 genomes of 2019\u2010nCoV obtained from humans have been released on GISAID (http://gisaid.org/).20 The BetaCoV/Wuhan/IPBCAMS\u2010WH\u201002/2019 (EPI_ISL_403931) sample shows evidence of sequencing artifacts due to the appearance of clustered spurious single\u2010nucleotide polymorphisms and thus was excluded in this study. The final dataset (\u201cdataset_32\u201d) included 32 genomes of 2019\u2010nCoV from China (n\u2009=\u200925), Thailand (n\u2009=\u20092), and USA (n\u2009=\u20095), with sampling dates between 24 December 2019 and 23 January 2020. Of the 25 samples collected from China, 14 were from Wuhan, Hubei Province, 6 were from Shenzhen, Guangdong Province, 2 were from Zhuhai, Guangdong Province, 2 were from Hangzhou, Zhejiang Province, and 1 was from Taiwan (Table S1). The sampling dates of BetaCoV/Shenzhen/HKU\u2010SZ\u2010005/2020 and BetaCoV/Shenzhen/HKU\u2010SZ\u2010002/2020 were known to the nearest month (January 2020). For this dataset, the 2019\u2010nCoV genomes were aligned using MAFFT v7.22221 and then manually curated using BioEdit v7.2.5.22 In addition, we subsampled three other datasets, that is, \u201cdataset_14\u201d collected between 24 December 2019 and 1 January 2020, comprising 14 genomes from Wuhan, Hubei Province, China; \u201cdataset_24\u201d collected between 24 December 2019 and 18 January 2020, comprising 24 genomes from China and Thailand; and \u201cdataset_30\u201d collected between 24 December 2019 and 23 January 2020, comprising 30 genomes from China, Thailand, and USA.\n2.2 Recombination and phylogenetic analyses\nTo assess the recombination for the full dataset (ie, \u201cdataset_32\u201d), we employed the pairwise homoplasy index (PHI) test to measure the similarity between closely linked sites using SplitsTree v4.15.1.23 The best\u2010fit nucleotide substitution model for \u201cdataset_32\u201d was identified according to the Akaike information criterion (AIC), small\u2010sample corrected AIC (AICc), Bayesian information criterion (BIC), and performance\u2010based decision theory (DT) method with 3 (24 candidate models) or 11 (88 candidate models) substitution schemes in jModelTest v2.1.10.24 To evaluate the phylogenetic signals of the datasets, we performed likelihood\u2010mapping analysis25 using TREE\u2010PUZZLE v5.3,26 with 35\u2009000 to 80\u2009000 randomly chosen quartets for the four datasets. Maximum\u2010likelihood (ML) phylogenies were reconstructed using the Hasegawa\u2010Kishino\u2010Yano (HKY) nucleotide substitution model in PhyML v3.1.27 Bootstrap support values were calculated with 1000 replicates and trees were midpoint rooted. Regression analyses were used to determine the correlations among sampling dates and root\u2010to\u2010tip genetic divergences of the four ML phylogenies using TempEst v1.5.28\n2.3 Reconstruction of time\u2010scaled phylogenies\nTo reconstruct the evolutionary history of 2019\u2010nCoV, Bayesian inference through a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) framework was implemented in BEAST v1.8.4,29 with the BEAGLE library program (v2.1.2)30 used to improve computation. For each dataset, we employed HKY, as well as a constant size coalescent tree prior and strict molecular clock model to estimate the time to a most recent common ancestor (TMRCA). We then used two schemes to set the time scale prior for each dataset, that is, constrained evolutionary rate method with a lognormal prior (mean\u2009=\u20091.0\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u22123 substitutions per site per year; 95% Bayesian credible interval (BCI): 1.854\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u22124\u20104\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u22123 substitutions per site per year) placed on the evolutionary rate parameter based on previous studies31-33 and the tip\u2010dating method, for which the evolutionary rate for each dataset was also estimated. To ensure adequate mixing of model parameters, MCMC chains were run for 100 million steps with sampling every 10\u2009000 steps from the posterior distribution. Convergence was evaluated by calculating the effective sample sizes of the parameters using Tracer v1.7.1.34 All parameters had an effective sample size of more than 200, indicative of sufficient sampling. Trees were summarized as maximum clade credibility (MCC) trees using TreeAnnotator v1.8.4 after discarding the first 10% as burn\u2010in and then visualized in FigTree v1.4.4 (http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/figtree).\n2.4 Transmission network reconstruction\nThe HIV TRAnsmission Cluster Engine (www.hivtrace.org)35 was employed to infer transmission network clusters for the full dataset (ie, \u201cdataset_32\u201d). All pairwise distances were calculated and a putative linkage between each pair of genomes was considered whenever their divergence was less than equal to 0.0001 (0.01%) or less than equal to 0.00001 (0.001%) substitutions/site (TN93 substitution model). Multiple linkages were then combined into putative transmission clusters. Clusters comprised of only two linked nodes were identified as dyads. This approach detects transmission clusters in which the clustering strains are genetically similar, implying a direct or indirect epidemiological connection.3 RESULTS\n3.1 Demographic characteristics of the full dataset\n\u201cDataset_32\u201d included 32 genomes of 2019\u2010nCoV strains sampled from China (Wuhan, n\u2009=\u200914; Shenzhen, n\u2009=\u20096; Zhuhai, n\u2009=\u20092; Hangzhou, n\u2009=\u20092; Taiwan, n\u2009=\u20091), Thailand (n\u2009=\u20092), and USA (n\u2009=\u20095) with sampling dates between 24 December 2019 and 23 January 2020 (Table S1). The samples were primarily from China (78.125%) and Wuhan (43.75%), the Chinese city identified as the region of the original 2019\u2010nCoV outbreak.\n3.2 Tree\u2010like signals and phylogenetic analyses\nFor \u201cdataset_32\u201d, the HKY model provided the best fit across the four different methods (ie, AIC, AICc, BIC, and DT) and two different substitution schemes (ie, 24 and 88 candidate models), and was thus used in subsequent likelihood\u2010mapping and phylogenetic analyses for the four datasets. The PHI test of \u201cdataset_32\u201d did not find statistically significant evidence for recombination (P\u2009=\u20091.0). Likelihood\u2010mapping analysis of \u201cdataset_14\u201d revealed that 100% of the quartets were distributed in the center of the triangle, indicating a strong star\u2010like topology signal reflecting a novel virus, which may be due to exponential epidemic spread (Figure 1A). Likewise, 91.9%, 81.8%, and 74.7% of the quartets from \u201cdataset_24,\u201d \u201cdataset_30,\u201d and \u201cdataset_32,\u201d respectively, were distributed in the center of the triangle, indicating relatively more phylogenetic signals as additional sequences were analyzed over time (Figure 1B\u2010D). ML phylogenetic analysis of the four datasets also showed star\u2010like topologies, in accordance with the likelihood\u2010mapping results (Figure 2). Root\u2010to\u2010tip regression analyses between genetic divergence and sampling date using the best\u2010fitting root showed that \u201cdataset_14\u201d had a relatively strong positive temporal signal (R2\u2009=\u2009.2967; correlation coefficient\u2009=\u2009.5446) (Figure 3A). In contrast, \u201cdataset_24\u201d had a minor negative temporal signal (R2\u2009=\u20094.4428\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u22122; correlation coefficient\u2009=\u2009\u2212.2108) (Figure 3B); whereas, \u201cdataset_30\u201d and \u201cdataset_32\u201d both had minor positive temporal signals (R2\u2009=\u20091.2155\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u22122; correlation coefficient\u2009=\u2009.1102 and R2\u2009=\u20091.1506\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u22122; correlation coefficient\u2009=\u2009.1073) (Figure 3C,D). On the basis of Bayesian time\u2010scaled phylogenetic analysis using the constrained evolutionary rate method with a lognormal prior (mean\u2009=\u20091.0\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u22123 substitutions per site per year; 95% BCI: 1.854\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u22124\u20104\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u22123 substitutions per site per year) placed on the evolutionary rate parameter, we estimated the TMRCA dates for 2019\u2010nCoV from the four datasets, that is, 1 November 2019 (95% BCI: 21 July 2019 and 29 December 2019), 10 November 2019 (95% BCI: 16 July 2019 and 16 January 2020), 21 October 2019 (95% BCI: 20 May 2019 and 19 January 2020), and 15 October 2019 (95% BCI: 2 May 2019 and 17 January 2020) for \u201cdataset_14,\u201d \u201cdataset_24,\u201d \u201cdataset_30,\u201d and \u201cdataset_32,\u201d respectively (Table 1). Furthermore, based on Bayesian time\u2010scaled phylogenetic analysis using the tip\u2010dating method, we also estimated the TMRCA dates and evolutionary rates from \u201cdataset_30\u201d and \u201cdataset_32,\u201d with resulting showing 6 December 2019 (95% BCI: 16 November 2019 and 22 December 2019) and 6 December 2019 (95% BCI: 16 November 2019 and 21 December 2019), respectively; and 1.7926\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u22123 substitutions per site per year (95% BCI: 7.216\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u22124\u20103.0558\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u22123) and 1.8266\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u22123 substitutions per site per year (95% BCI: 7.5813\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u22124\u20103.0883\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u22123), respectively (Table 1). Due to poor convergence in the MCMC chains, we did not obtain the TMRCA date and evolutionary rate from \u201cdataset_14\u201d and \u201cdataset_24.\u201d The estimates of the MCC phylogenetic relationships among the 2019\u2010nCoV genomes from the Bayesian coalescent framework using the constrained evolutionary rate method with a lognormal prior (mean\u2009=\u20091.0\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u22123 substitutions per site per year; 95% BCI: 1.854\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u22124\u20104\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u22123 substitutions per site per year) placed on the evolutionary rate parameter and using the tip\u2010dating method are displayed in Figures 4 and 5, respectively. As shown, three phylogenetic clusters (number of sequences 2\u20106; posterior probability .99\u20101.0) were identified, that is, Guangdong/20SF028/2020 and Guangdong/20SF040/2020 from Zhuhai, Guangdong Province, China, reported from a family cluster infection; USA/CA2/2020 and Taiwan/2/2020 from USA and Taiwan; Guangdong/20SF012/2020, Guangdong/20SF013/2020, Guangdong/20SF025/2020, Shenzhen/HKU\u2010SZ\u2010002/2020, Shenzhen/HKU\u2010SZ\u2010005/2020, and USA/AZ1/2020 from Shenzhen, Guangdong Province, China, and USA, which included five genomes (Guangdong/20SF012/2020, Guangdong/20SF013/2020, Guangdong/20SF025/2020, Shenzhen/HKU\u2010SZ\u2010002/2020, and Shenzhen/HKU\u2010SZ\u2010005/2020) reported from a family cluster infection.\nFigure 1\nOpen in figure viewerPowerPoint\nLikelihood\u2010mapping analyses of 2019\u2010nCOV.

This allowed us to identify a single large transmission cluster that included 30 of 32 (93.75%) genomes, thus suggesting low genetic divergence for \u201cdataset_32\u201d (Figure 6A). We also considered individuals as genetically linked when the genetic distance between 2019\u2010nCoV strains was less than 0.001% substitutions/site. This allowed us to identify three transmission clusters that included 15 of 32 (46.875%) genomes for \u201cdataset_32\u201d (Figure 6B). Clusters ranged in size from two to nine genomes. Two clusters, which contained two (Guangdong/20SF028/2020 and Guangdong/20SF040/2020) and four genomes (Guangdong/20SF012/2020, Guangdong/20SF013/2020, Guangdong/20SF025/2020, and Shenzhen/HKU\u2010SZ\u2010002/2020), respectively, included individuals sampled exclusively from Zhuhai and Shenzhen, respectively. The largest cluster of nine genomes included five sampled from Wuhan (Wuhan\u2010Hu\u20101/2019, Wuhan/IVDC\u2010HB\u201001/2019, Wuhan/WIV04/2019, Wuhan/WIV06/2019, and Wuhan/IPBCAMS\u2010WH\u201004/2019), one sampled from Hangzhou (Zhejiang/WZ\u201002/2020), two sampled from Thailand (Nonthaburi/61/2020 and Nonthaburi/74/2020), and one sampled from USA (USA/IL1/2020).\nFigure 6\nOpen in figure viewerPowerPoint\nTransmission clusters of 2019\u2010nCOV. Structure of inferred 2019\u2010nCOV transmission clusters from full dataset (\u201cdataset_32\u201d) using genetic distances of less than 0.01% and less than 0.001% substitutions/site are illustrated in (A) and (B), respectively. Nodes (circles) represent connected individuals in the overall network, and putative transmission linkages are represented by edges (lines). Nodes are color\u2010coded by sampling locations4 DISCUSSION\nOn the basis of \u201cdataset_32,\u201d which included 32 genomes of 2019\u2010nCoV strains sampled from China (Wuhan, n\u2009=\u200914; Shenzhen, n\u2009=\u20096; Zhuhai, n\u2009=\u20092; Hangzhou, n\u2009=\u20092; Taiwan, n\u2009=\u20091), Thailand (n\u2009=\u20092), and USA (n\u2009=\u20095) with sampling dates between 24 December 2019 and 23 January 2020, and subsampled \u201cdataset_14,\u201d \u201cdataset_24,\u201d and \u201cdataset_30,\u201d which included 14, 24, and 30 2019\u2010nCoV strain genomes, respectively, our likelihood\u2010mapping analysis confirmed additional tree\u2010like signals (from 0% to 8.2%, 18.2%, and 25.4%) over time, thus indicating increasing genetic divergence of 2019\u2010nCoV in human hosts (Figure 1). Of note, the strong star\u2010like signal (100% of quartets were distributed in the center of the triangle) from \u201cdataset_14\u201d at the beginning of the virus outbreak suggests that 2019\u2010nCoV initially exhibited low genetic divergence, with recent and rapid human\u2010to\u2010human transmission. This result is consistent with the ML phylogenetic analyses, which showed polytomy topology from \u201cdataset_14\u201d (Figure 2A). The genetic divergence from \u201cdataset_32\u201d and \u201cdataset_30\u201d was higher than that for \u201cdataset_14,\u201d but still demonstrated minor temporal signals (Figure 3). Using the constrained evolutionary rate method, the mean TMRCA dates for 2019\u2010nCoV based on the four datasets ranged from 15 October to 10 November 2019, when using a lognormal prior (mean\u2009=\u20091.0\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u22123 substitutions per site per year; 95% BCI: 1.854\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u22124\u20104\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u22123 substitutions per site per year) placed on the evolutionary rate parameter (Table 1). This is considered reasonable given the limited genetic divergence and strong star\u2010like signals and is also consistent with our previous study.36 Using the tip\u2010dating method, the mean TMRCA date and evolutionary rate for 2019\u2010nCoV based on the \u201cdataset_30\u201d and \u201cdataset_32\u201d ranged from 16 November to 22 December 2019 and from 1.7926\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u22123 to 1.8266\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u22123 substitutions per site per year, respectively (Table 1). The TMRCA estimated by the tip\u2010dating method was relatively narrower than that determined by the constrained evolutionary rate method. We identified three phylogenetic clusters with posterior probabilities between .99 and 1.0 using Bayesian inference (Figures 4 and 5). We also identified three transmission clusters when the genetic distance between the 2019\u2010nCoV strains was less than 0.001% substitutions/site (Figure 6). Intriguingly, only one cluster (Guangdong/20SF028/2020 and Guangdong/20SF040/2020 from Zhuhai) was identified by both phylogenetic and network\u2010based methods. This is a good example showing the differences between phylogenetic (posterior probability or bootstrap value) and network\u2010based (genetic distance) methods. However, our conclusions should be considered preliminary and explained with caution due to the limited number of 2019\u2010nCOV genome sequences presented in this study.\nThe first genome sequence of 2019\u2010nCoV was made public in early January 2020, with several dozen\u2014taken from various people\u2014now available. The genome sequences of 2019\u2010nCoV have already led to diagnostic tests, as well as efforts to study its dispersal and evolution. As the outbreak continues, we will require multiple genome sequences of samples over the course of the outbreak and from different locations to determine how the virus evolves. We also need to gain a better understanding of the virus's biology, especially compared to findings from previous studies on the SARS and MERS viruses. For instance, 2019\u2010nCoV can kill cultured human cells, entering them via the same molecular receptor as SARS\u2010CoV.18 Therefore, it is essential that we isolate, share, and study virus samples, both in China and elsewhere, to identify animals that exhibit similar infection to humans for drug and vaccine testing, to better understand virus transmission (eg, airborne or close contact), and to develop blood tests for viral antibodies. Currently, 2019\u2010nCoV has primarily caused severe illness and death in older people, particularly those with pre\u2010existing conditions such as diabetes and heart disease. Although this virus does not typically infect or kill young and healthy individuals, a 36\u2010year\u2010old Wuhan man with no known pre\u2010existing health conditions has been the youngest victim reported so far. In situations where a virus jumps from one animal host to another species\u2014which is probably how this coronavirus initially infected humans\u2014most mutations are detrimental to or have no effect on the virus, and selection pressure may improve survival in the new host. Therefore, we predict that one or more mutations may be selected and sustained during the 2019\u2010nCoV outbreak as the virus adapts to human hosts and possibly reduces its virulence, as reported in the previous study.37 However, we are uncertain whether this will influence its transmissibility.\nIn conclusion, our results emphasize the importance of likelihood\u2010mapping, transmission network, and phylogenetic analyses in providing insights into the time origin, genetic diversity, and transmission dynamics of 2019\u2010nCOV. Improving the linkage between patient records and genome sequence data would also allow large\u2010scale studies to be undertaken. Such research could directly influence public health in terms of prevention efforts introduced to reduce virus transmission in real\u2010time.ACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThis study was supported by a grant from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 31470268) to Yi Li.

The new virus, a coronavirus named SARS\u2010CoV\u20102, was reported in December 2019. Since then, it has reached over 110 countries and territories with more than 125\u2009000 reported cases at the time of this report.1 This new coronavirus disease (COVID\u201019) has caused more than 3100 deaths, mainly in continental China and mostly on elderly people, who are affected by fever and serious respiratory diseases like pneumonia.2-4\nSARS\u2010CoV\u20102 has a single\u2010stranded RNA genome and its length is similar to other related coronaviruses, with an extension near 29\u2009890\u2009bp (GenBank NC_045512.2). The most related genomes available in public databases were bat\u2010SL\u2010CoVZC45 (GenBank MG772933) with an 87.99% sequence identity and bat\u2010SL\u2010CoVZXC21 (GenBank MG772934) with an 87.23% sequence identity,5 followed by the human viruses SARS\u2010CoV\u2010Tor2 (GenBank NC_004718) and MERS\u2010CoV (GenBank NC_019843) with a 79.0% and 51.8% of nucleotide identity, respectively.6\nThe genome organization of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 was shown to be similar of the related bats and human coronavirus. The open reading frames (ORFs) from 5\u2032 to 3\u2032 is as follows: 5\u2032 UTR; ORF1ab with 16 nonstructural proteins (nsp) 1 to 16 including RNA polymerase RNA\u2010dependent nsp12, Helicase nsp13 and 3\u2032\u2010to\u20105\u2032 exonuclease nsp14, S surface spike protein, E envelope protein, M membrane protein, and N nucleocapsid protein. There are also at least six predicted ORFs as hypothetical proteins with no associated function.4, 6, 7\nNear 286 complete genomes of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 and related viruses, has been submitted to the GISAID database (www.gisaid.org/CoV2020) collecting genetic information of the outbreak worldwide. The genomic sequences of all SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 viruses isolated from patients share a sequence identity about a 99.9%,7 suggesting a recently zoonotic infection, originated most probably from bats.5, 6, 8\nAs the information appears daily, new insights and concepts are being adopted and implemented. Recently Tang et al9 and GISAD database in the SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 portal defined three subtypes: S, G, and V, according to nucleotide variants that produce amino acid changes. These changes are located in ORF8 L84S; S (spike protein) D614G and nsp3 G251V, in the nucleotide position 28144, 23403, and 3471, respectively, for S, G, and V, according to the reference sequence NC_045512.2.\nChile was the fourth country in South America after Brazil, Ecuador, and Argentina to report COVID\u201019 in the region. In this report, we present the sequence analysis for the first four complete genomes for SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 isolates on Chilean patients. Also, a phylogenetic study was performed with worldwide SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 sequences and the full genomes from Chilean isolates, to identify their genetic similarity.2 MATERIALS AND METHODS\n2.1 Epidemiological information\nThe four cases presented in this report have contracted the infection abroad, either in Southeast Asia or Europe. The first two cases (20\u201018918, 20\u201019303) correspond to a couple in their early thirties, who traveled from Chile to Barcelona, Spain, where they stayed between January 27th and January 30th. On January 31th they traveled to Singapore, between February 4th to February 12th they were in Indonesia, then they visited Malaysia on February 13th, and the Maldives on February 15th. Between February 21st and 24th they stayed in Madrid, from where they traveled back to Chile arriving in Santiago on February 25th. The man showed symptoms first and was diagnosed as the first SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 case in Chile, followed by his spouse 1 day later. That same day, a third case (20\u201019305) was confirmed. A 56\u2010year\u2010old woman who visited London between February 22nd and 23rd, Venice (February 23rd \u201025th), London (February 25th\u201028th), Madrid (February 28th to March 3rd) when she returned to Santiago. On the next day (March 5th) the fourth case (20\u201019731) was reported, a 40\u2010year\u2010old woman, who traveled to Milan between February 25th and 29th, traveling back to Chile.\n2.2 Sample types, RNA extraction, and virus detection\nChilean law by the Supreme Decree 7/2019 mandates notification of communicable diseases and their surveillance. All cases showed mild symptoms, and throat swab specimens were collected. A volume of 140\u2009\u00b5L of each sample was used for viral RNA extraction with QIAamp Viral Mini Kit (Cat. No. 52926; Qiagen) in a QIACube extractor. All suspicious cases were confirmed by real\u2010time reverse transcription\u2010polymerase chain reaction (RT\u2010PCR), using specific probe and primers, synthesized and purified in our facilities, targeting the RNA\u2010dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) region of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102, according to the guidelines suggested by the World Health Organization.10 SuperScript III One\u2010Step RT\u2010PCR Platinum Taq DNA Polymerase (Cat. No. 12574026; Invitrogen) was used for real\u2010time RT\u2010PCR. Running method 55\u00b0C for 10\u2009minutes, followed by 94\u00b0C for 2\u2009minutes, and 45 cycles at 94\u00b0C for 15\u2009seconds and 58\u00b0C for 30\u2009seconds. Ct's under 35 were considered as positive cases.\n2.3 Full viral genome amplification\nFrom total RNA extraction we performed the first amplification round using SuperScript III One\u2010Step RT\u2010PCR Platinum Taq DNA Polymerase (Invitrogen) and six pair of specific primers to obtain six complementary DNA fragments around 5\u2009Kbp each, followed by a second amplification round with 24 specific primers (Table S1) to generate two fragments from each first round products, each subfragment (a total of 12) are around 2.3 to 2.7\u2009Kbp.\n2.4 Library generation and sequencing\nThe 12 DNA fragments from full genome amplification were pooled, and libraries were prepared with the Nextera XT Library Prep Kit (Illumina, San Diego, CA), purified with Agencourt AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA) and quantified by Victor Nivo Fluorometer (PerkinElmer) using Quant\u2010it dsDNA HS Assay kit (Invitrogen). The resulting DNA libraries were sequenced on MiSeq (Illumina) using a 300\u2010cycle reagent kit. About 0.3\u2009GB of data was obtained for each sample.\n2.5 Phylogenetic analysis\nThe sequencing quality was analyzed with software Fastqc v0.11.8 and then, the reads were filtered and trimmed using BBDuk software considering a minimum read length of 36 bases and quality more than equal to 10. SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 assembly was performed with IRMA v0.9.3 using as reference NCBI sequence ID NC_045512.2. Sequence alignment was performed with MAFFT. The phylogenetic tree was built with IQ\u2010TREE v1.6.12 considering a bootstrap of 1000. We consider 218 full complete genome sequences available in the GISAID platform plus the full genome sequences from the first four Chilean cases.3 RESULTS\nThe first four cases in Chilean territory were reported between March 3rd and 5th. All of these persons reported travel to places where the presence of the virus was confirmed and with an increasing number of cases.\nWe identified the SNPs that generates amino acid changes in all four Chilean genomes (Table 1). For the first and second samples (couple) the sequences are identical and the SNPs generates nonsynonymous mutations in ORF1ab\u2010nsp14\u20103\u2032\u2010to\u20105\u2032 exonuclease (V290F), ORF8 (L84S) and N\u2010nucleocapsid phosphoprotein (D103Y).

For the Chilean strains, the first three cases (20\u201018918, 20\u201019303, 20\u201019305) are classified as \u201cS\u201d type, meanwhile, the fourth case (20\u201019731) is a \u201cG\u201d type, according to nucleotide substitutions in the positions 28\u2009144 and 23\u2009403, respectively.\nA maximum\u2010likelihood phylogeny tree was constructed using 218 complete genome sequences plus the four Chilean cases. Our first two samples, the married couple, mapped together (100% nucleotide identity) and with strains from Wuhan, China and Taiwan. The third sample groups in a well\u2010defined clade with Spanish isolates. The fourth Chilean strain, groups in a European clade with samples from Switzerland, Netherlands, and Germany. In this same clade, we can identify one of the Brazilian and Mexican isolates, representing isolates from Latin America. In addition, the complete genomes were colored according to the variant groups, defined by specific mutations (Figure 1).\nFigure 1\nOpen in figure viewerPowerPoint\nPhylogenetic tree with Maximum Composite Likelihood distance, representing 222 complete genomes including the four Chilean isolates. The name of the isolates were colored according to the variants as follows: S (blue), G (red), V (purple), unclassified variants (green), and the main clades were highlighted. Chilean strains are marked over the cladogram in the S and G variant clades4 DISCUSSION\nIn this early stage of the epidemic, sharing data and information is crucial and the efforts of the scientist worldwide are admirable. After a few weeks since the outbreak started in Wuhan province, the full genome sequence of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 was available, and this information paved the way for the development of better detection protocols techniques, antiviral strategies, and phylogeny studies, among others scientific challenges. Here we report the first four cases of COVID\u201019 and the complete genome sequencing for these strains. We developed an RT\u2010PCR based strategy to amplify the whole genome in two steps, followed by the library construction and further NGS using Illumina MiSeq. In less than 5 days since we detected the first case, the whole genomes for the first four cases were assembled. We implemented in early January the complete detection system by real\u2010time RT\u2010PCR for this new virus in the Public Health Institute of Chile, according to international guidelines.\nThe phylogenetic analysis plus the travel information of each patient, allows us to infer about the viral entries to Chilean territory. We detected two different viral variants entries to Chile, the S and G. For S variant, the viral genome distribution of Chilean isolates allows to associate these in two different clades, one related to the Wuhan province in China and Taiwan, and a second clade related with Spanish isolates, coincident with the patient's travel record. COVID\u201019 cases in Spain started to be reported since February 1st with a very low number of cases for about a month, where the reported cases may be underestimated, and after a month the infected people started to raise over a hundred patients.11, 12 In the case of the G variant entry, the infected patient visited Europe and the complete sequence genome for this case, groups with isolates from the Netherlands, Switzerland, and Spain among other European countries (Figure 1). At the date of this report, we have detected more than 30 positive cases, mainly from Chilean travelers returning to the country and local transmission between their closest relatives.\nAt the beginning of the pandemic (until mid\u2010February), when 99% of the cases were focused in continental China, the death toll was about 2%. As the virus is spread by travelers, the number of cases and death occurrence has increased in other territories like South Korea, Iran, and Italy. In this last country the death toll up to date reaches the 6.2%, this number is still far from statistics of other related human coronavirus epidemics, like SARS (9.5%) and MERS (34.4%).13 Until now, there is no enough evidence to relate specific mutation in the viral genome to a higher number of infected patients or even death, the main number of fatalities is still related to the elderly population.\nIn conclusion, our work presents the complete genome analysis for the first cases of COVID\u201019 in Chile, detecting at least two different viral variants entries to Chilean territory. This information contributes to monitoring the spread of the infection and the surveillance for eventual recombination or genome mutations that the diversity of host, countries, weather conditions and other selective pressures that this new coronavirus could face. The globalization, increment of worldwide travelers and the high contagious rate of this virus require severe control measures to control infection dissemination.ACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThe authors are thankful to Mar\u00eda Iba\u00f1ez and Jorge Lobos for their valuable technical assistance.CONFLICT OF INTERESTS\nThe authors declare that there are no conflict of interests.AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS\nCAE participated in conceptualization, study design, interpreting the data analysis, methodology design, visualization, and wrote the whole manuscript.

As many of the patients had visited a fish and wild animal market, the possibility of a recurrence of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) needed to be investigated.2 Finally, could this outbreak of pneumonia be caused by a novel coronavirus that was different from those causing SARS or Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)3? Once this outbreak was recognized as a serious threat, a special team consisting of physicians, scientists, and epidemiologists began to investigate these possibilities. Within 9 days, SARS and MERS had been ruled out and a novel coronavirus had been isolated in Wuhan; this coronavirus is now officially named as the SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses. The breadth and nature of the investigation that identified this novel SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 is elaborately described by Zhu and colleagues in a recent publication in The New England Journal of Medicine.4 Additional details subsequently have been published in several prestigious journals.5-14 This study is quite remarkable and praiseworthy.\nGiven the subsequent spread to other parts of China as well as to other countries, the reasons for this spread should be examined. There are two such reasons that are noteworthy. The first is that the potential threat of these initial cases of pneumonia was not well\u2010appreciated. The second reason is simply the timing of this outbreak; the outbreak began just before the Chinese New Year. By the time the investigation had been completed, the Chinese New Year was underway. The Chinese New Year is one of the most important holidays in China and celebrates the beginning of the new year on the traditional Chinese calendar. The first day of the Chinese New Year was on 25 January 2020. The Chinese New Year is associated with a number of customs; among these is returning home for an annual reunion dinner. Thus, traveling home had already begun by the time Chinese authorities attempted to curtail the spread of the coronavirus by extending the lunar new year holidays and suspending travel.14 This made control measure of the outbreak more difficult. The net effect of the initial delay in the investigation and the holiday travel was, in effect, the \u201cPerfect Storm.\u201d\nThe results of the spread within China of the SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 are considerable and still unfolding. Given the timing of this outbreak, the inability of the Chinese government's measures to control this epidemic and limit most of these cases to Wuhan is understandable. The question then is, \u201cWhat's next for China?\u201d As earlier suggested, there remains considerable work to be done.1 This study includes many issues that can be determined in the short term as well as some that will require long\u2010term solutions. Some of these issues are as follows. The timing of colonization, infection, and shedding need to be determined. For example, are infected persons first colonized? Do infected persons shed virus before they have clinical symptoms? Transmission characteristics need to be determined. Is infectious transmission limited to respiratory droplets or can the virus be transmitted by contact with an infected person? Efficient human\u2010to\u2010human transmission is required for large\u2010scale spread (ie, an epidemic or pandemic) of any emerging virus. Therefore, the basic reproductive ratio during this epidemic needs to be determined; the basic reproductive ratio is defined as the average number of secondary cases that an infected person produces during their entire infectious period in a susceptible and uninfected population.15 The case\u2010fatality rate needs to be accurately determined; the case\u2010fatality rate of the SARS\u2010CoV was around 11%. Some of these questions are already being addressed,16, 17 but further work is needed. Often serology is required in such an epidemic to determine how many persons may have had clinically inapparent infections. Detection and identification methods that are accurate and can be performed in real time at the point of care or in the field need to be developed.1 The exact relationship between the SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 and animals (eg, bats) needs to be determined.4, 18, 19 Although bats are suspected, the question of how the virus has moved from bats to the human host needs to be resolved. Does this transmission involve intermediate animal hosts as occurred with SARS\u2010CoV and MERS\u2010CoV? If the SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 proves to have an animal sources, the continued presence of live animal markets in China must be seriously questioned. In the long term, the development of vaccines and antiviral therapy needs to be a higher priority than it has been since the SARS pandemic in 2002 to 2003; the lack of a SARS vaccine or SARS antiviral therapy suggests that such research has not been a priority. For example, Ampligen (poly I:poly C124) has been shown to inhibit SARS\u2010CoV in a murine lung model, yet has not been further evaluated in humans.20 Similarly, Remdesivir (GS\u20105734) has been shown to inhibit both epidemic and zoonotic coronaviruses.21 It is likely that continued investigation of new antiviral agents with activity against coronaviruses in the absence of ongoing active epidemics would be enhanced by government incentives. Another issue in the long term that needs to be addressed is the potential of novel coronaviruses to spread within medical centers to health care workers as has happened with SARS\u2010CoV and MERS\u2010CoV.22-24 Most medical centers, whether in China or in the United States, are not prepared for such a problem. For example, negative\u2010pressure containment rooms with proper anterooms are either not found or found only in limited numbers in medical centers in the United States.25\nThe recent epidemic in China caused by the SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 is yet another example of emerging zoonotic viral diseases.18 Like previous epidemics/pandemics caused by novel members of the coronavirus family, there are many lessons to be learned. Much work remains to be done before this latest coronavirus is fully understood and these lessons can be learned.AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS\nConcept forming: HL and Y\u2010WT. Writing: CWS. Revising and editing: HL and Y\u2010WT.", "25774": "I read with great interest the paper published ahead\u2010of\u2010print in the Journal of Medical Virology by Liu et al1 on comparisons of the spike sequences between severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS\u2010CoV\u20102) and SARS\u2010CoV, bat SARS\u2010like CoV, and other coronaviruses, supporting the fact that snakes, pangolins, also turtles may act as potential intermediate hosts that transmit SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 to humans. As we do believe that the evolutionary analysis and finding on the possible virus reservoirs are helpful in understanding the diffusion of the novel 2019 coronavirus (SARS\u2010CoV\u20102) causing the coronavirus disease (COVID\u201019), with this letter I want to discuss the implications that descend from the coincidence of the virus binding site with the membrane angiotensin\u2010converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor.2\nAs it was previously stated, for the establishment of SARS coronavirus infections, the endocytosis of virus particles into host cells is needed. Surprisingly, the ACE2 has been identified as a functional receptor,3 as ACE2\u2013Spike interaction is the mechanisms that lead through a process of internalization with ACE2, to the endocytosis4 (Figure 1). This mechanism is shared with all SARS coronavirus family that, now, includes the SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 causing the severe COVID\u201019.\nFigure 1\nOpen in figure viewerPowerPoint\nInternalisation of SARS\u2010CoV into an epithelial cell by using ACE2 as functional receptor.

We do have much more information on ACE1 effects, whereas details about ACE2 is only assumed; cardiovascular therapies are focused on ACE1, although ACE2 is supposed to be a promising target. We know also that ACE2 is abundantly present in the epithelia of the human lungs, which might explain the possible routes of the COVID\u201019 providing evidence to the recently observed severe case of pneumonia in China with a high mortality rate, and in the intestine, suggesting other possible routes of transmission.9\nThus, the questions that I want to point out and discuss with virologists are as follows:\n1.\nHow is common to share biomolecular targets between viruses and active mediators of the cardiovascular system? Is it a \u201ccoincidence\u201d due to the spread over species and ancient phylogeny of renin\u2013angiotensin system? I mean, do viruses use as a binding site a functional receptor that is, usually, involved in the control of vascular tone, arterial blood pressure, and fibrotic response to damage? Is this functional? Or, instead, if this is not common, it is a possible evolution of viruses, eventually, driven by experiments and/or worldwide use of treatment targeting RAAS receptors?\n2.\nThis fact raises questions on safety when using ACEi and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) in patients affected by COVID\u201019, as these therapies, which are widely used for the treatment of high blood pressure and heart failure, having as main target ACE1, can cause the upregulation of ACE2, with the consequence of open access routes to the COVID\u201019. On the contrary, it is not possible to exclude that less\u2010selective ACEi/ARBs might be also helpful by blocking, even partially, ACE2. In this regard, it might be useful to obtain epidemiological data on patients affected by COVID\u201019 that are assuming ACEi/ARB.", "25944": "", "25796": "1 INTRODUCTION\nIn December 2019, a pneumonia outbreak, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS\u2010CoV\u20102), was first identified in Wuhan, China and presented a major threat to public health.1 Nationwide, there were more than 70\u2009000 confirmed cases and 2500 deaths.2 Most patients were elderly, with severe disease.3, 4 For acute respiratory infection, reverse\u2010transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT\u2010PCR) is routinely used to detect causative viruses in respiratory secretions.5 Coronavirus RNA can be detected from the nose and throat swabs, sputum, and other lower respiratory tract secretions, blood, and feces. Such specimens were examined by RT\u2010PCR. Three targets, RdRP, E, and N genes were detected, indicating samples were positive for SARS\u2010CoV\u20102.6 After patient recovery, a chest computed tomography (CT) examination, combined with SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 RNA detection, confirmed diagnosis. However, some recovery patients with negative RNA tests turned RNA positive. The preliminary data is about 14% of discharged patients in Guangdong reported by the Guangdong Center for Disease Control (CDC).\nThis is an important scientific issue. If samples are positive for SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 RNA, patients should be managed according to infection source. Fortunately, there were no close contacts of second\u2010generation cases. We herein report six SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 cases confirmed in our hospital, for the changes of results of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 RNA should attract attention. Most patients were elderly, with a low Geriatric Nutritional Risk Index (GNRI). However, the association of the phenomenon with aging and GNRI has not yet been reported in detail. Further investigations are necessary to confirm and improve these findings. Similarly, discharged patient follow\u2010up should be strengthened.2 CASE REPORT\n2.1 Case 1\nA 65\u2010year\u2010old man had a 7\u2010day cough history on January 20, 2020. The patient's main complaint was cough, but he had no fever, white phlegm, stuffiness, runny nose, vertigo, fatigue, tight chest, or nausea. He returned from Wuhan to Zhuhai on January 12th by train. The patient's wife was a laboratory\u2010confirmed case. On the basis of his primary laboratory report, chest radiographs, clinical and epidemiologic information, the patient was confirmed with coronavirus disease\u20102019 (COVID\u201019), and received combination therapy. This included oseltamivir phosphate capsules (75\u2009mg twice a day, 0\u20103 days), recombinant human interferon alfa\u20102b (6 million IU twice a day, 0\u20107 days), moxifloxacin hydrochloride (0.4\u2009g daily, 0\u201017 days), normal human immunoglobulin (5.0\u2009g daily, 6\u20108 days), lopinavir\u2010ritonavir tablets (0.5\u2009g twice a day, 6\u201021 days), and human serum albumin (20\u2009g daily, 1\u20107 days). On day eight of treatment, human serum albumin was reduced to 10\u2009g daily, and withdrawn on day 10. Laboratory tests are shown (Table 1). The results indicated the patient had stable vital signs, with significantly reduced lymphocytes. The patient's nutritional condition was evaluated by GNRI (Table 1, note). The patient had a low GNRI nutritional status, with a high nutrition\u2010related risk (GNRI\u2009<\u200982, Table 1, Day 0). On day 18 of treatment, his nasopharynx swab was negative for SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 RNA. These results were persistently negative on days 18 and 20. The patient's GNRI nutritional status also improved. Cough symptoms improved, and lung lesions were partially absorbed. The patient was transferred to the transition ward and drug treatment was suspended (also isolation ward). However, when a SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 RNA assay was performed on days 22 and 23, the results were positive.\nTable 1.

This included; arbidol hydrochloride tablets (0.2\u2009g three times a day, 0\u20102 days), moxifloxacin hydrochloride (0.4\u2009g daily, 0\u20105 days), chloroquine (0.5\u2009g twice a day, 2\u201013 days), ceftriaxone sodium injection (1.0\u2009g twice a day, 5\u20107 days), linezolid injection (600\u2009mg twice a day, 5\u20107 days), thymosin alpha\u20101 injection (1.6\u2009mg daily, 6\u20107 days), and lopinavir\u2010ritonavir tablets (0.5\u2009g daily, 14\u201016 days). On day 14 of treatment, chloroquine was reduced to 0.5\u2009g daily, and withdrawn on day 16. The patient had a low GNRI nutritional status, with a high nutrition\u2010related risk (GNRI\u2009<\u200982, Table 2, Day 0). On the second day of treatment, the patient's temperature indicated low\u2010grade intermittent fever (ranging from 36.0\u00b0C to 37.5\u00b0C). On day 16 of treatment, the nasopharynx swab was negative for SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 RNA. These results were persistently negative on days 16, 17, and 18. The GNRI nutritional status improved. The patient was without fever for 7 days, and lung lesions were partially absorbed (Figure S1). The patient was, therefore, transferred to a transition ward, and drug treatment was suspended (also isolation ward). When the SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 RNA assay was rechecked on day 20 and 21, the assay was positive.\nTable 2.

Combination therapy included levofloxacin tablets (0.5\u2009g daily, 0\u20105 days), chloroquine (0.5\u2009g twice a day, 2\u201011 days) and thymosin alpha\u20101 injection (1.6\u2009mg daily, 6\u201010 days). On day 10 of treatment, a nasopharynx swab was negative for SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 RNA. These results were persistently negative from days 11 to 18. Clinical symptoms improved and lung lesions were partially absorbed. However, fecal swabs were persistently positive for SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 RNA. The patient was transferred to a transition ward, and drug treatment was suspended. On day 28, a nasopharynx swab was rechecked and was positive for SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 RNA, but a feces swab was negative.\n2.6 Case 6\nA 36\u2010year\u2010old female patient, was a laboratory\u2010confirmed case in contact with travelers from Wuhan, without apparent clinical symptoms. Combination therapy included chloroquine (0.5\u2009g twice a day, 0\u201011 days), thymosin alpha\u20101 injection (1.6\u2009mg daily, 6\u201010 days) and arbidol hydrochloride tablets (0.2\u2009g three times a day, 12\u201014 days). On day 6 of treatment, clinical symptoms improved and lung lesions were partially absorbed (Figure S4). Nasopharynx swabs were persistently negative for SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 RNA on days 7, 8, 9, 10, and 11. Results for fecal swabs were also persistently negative from day 10. The patient was then transferred to a transition ward, and drug treatment suspended. However, a nasopharynx swab was rechecked on day 15 and was positive for SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 RNA.3 DISCUSSION\nThere are several possible explanations for SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 RNA changes in patients. First, pneumonia is a relatively long\u2010lasting disease, often requiring 2 to 3 months to recover. Older people or people with poor health, may also have a slower recovery from pneumonia.7 However, a large part of the patients\u2019 lung inflammation is in the process of absorption, and has not yet reached clinical recovery. In terms of microorganisms, humans produce antibodies after viral infection, which may prevent subsequent spread. For elderly people, it may take longer to produce such antibodies, suggesting low viral levels may persistent.8 Four of our six patients were elderly and GNRI was calculated to evaluate the nutritional status of these patients. They all had a low GNRI nutritional status (GNRI\u2009<\u200982, Tables 1\u20104, Day 0). During combination therapy, which also included nutritional support, patient GNRI nutritional status improved. GNRI is a universally adopted index evaluating patient nutritional conditions; it is an effective and simple risk index that represents a patients\u2019 nutritional risk, and has been proven as a predictive index for prognoses in hospitalized elderly patients.9 Malnutrition is one reason why elderly patients are high\u2010risk patients. Many such patients lack nourishment, and disease\u2010related malnutrition is associated with higher mortality and morbidity and delays in illness recovery.10 Thus nutritional support may enhance patient tolerance for disease. Similarly, GNRI may be useful in identifying patients with high risk, such as elderly patients with COVID\u201019. Further investigations must confirm and improve these findings. In addition, frailty and sarcopenia indices can be used to evaluate and grade elderly patients with COVID\u201019.\nSecond, negative RNA results cannot rule out new coronavirus infections. Factors causing false negatives must be excluded, including poor sample quality from the nose and throat and other parts, samples collected too early or too late, improperly stored samples, improperly transported and processed samples, technology issues, such as virus mutation, PCR inhibition, etc. Specimen collection issues also impact on the accuracy of RNA detection, potentially leading to false negative results. More research is required to identify specific mechanisms and reasons. To increase positive detection rates, it is recommended that sputum samples be taken frequently and that tracheal intubation is performed on patients with lower respiratory tract secretions. After patient discharge, the body's immune functions are low during the recovery period; there may be a risk of infection from other pathogens.11 Therefore, discharged patients must isolate for a further 2 weeks to ensure safety. According to the 7th edition of prevention and control of pneumonia from novel coronavirus infections, released by China CDC, designated hospitals should contact primary medical institutions where patients live, share case data, and promptly push the discharged patient information to the patient's jurisdiction or the residential committee and primary medical institutions. Discharged patients are recommended to isolate for management and health monitoring for 14 days, with a return to hospital in the second and fourth week after discharge. New and more accurate diagnostic methodologies must be developed to improve strategies for disease prevention and health promotion.4 CONCLUSIONS\nGNRI may be useful in identifying high\u2010risk elderly patients with COVID\u201019. Patients with low GNRI should have real\u2010time nutritional support, but further research will confirm this. Similarly, the follow\u2010up of discharged patients should be strengthened.CONFLICT OF INTERESTS\nThe authors declare that there are no conflict of interests.", "25956": "", "25732": "A pneumonia of unknown pathogen that emerged in China had its first case announced in early December 2019 within Wuhan City, the capital of Hubei Province and one of the busiest and populated Chinese cities.1 The causative agent was identified as a novel coronavirus and named SARS\u2010CoV\u20102. Patients infected by the SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 showed symptoms of fever and dyspnoea, lymphopenia, and ground\u2010glass lung changes in radiology.2, 3 Severe cases developed life\u2010threatening complications, such as respiratory failure, shock, and multiple organs dysfunction.4 We report on an identified unique severe case involving co\u2010infection of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 and HIV.\nOn 28 January 2020, a 61\u2010years\u2010old male from Hankou district of Wuhan reported recurrent fever and dry cough for 2 days went to a local fever clinic, which was setup for screening the SARS\u2010CoV\u20102\u2010infected and suspected subjects. The patient was a heavy smoker of between 20 to 30 cigarettes a day. He had also been diagnosed with type II diabetes 2 year ago and received alogliptin co\u2010administered with metformin. The body temperature was 37.5\u00b0C. The clinic physician ordered blood routine test and chest computed tomography (CT), and was confirmed to have a mild lymphopenia with a lymphocyte count of 1.1\u2009\u00d7\u2009109/L. The chest CT indicated the SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 pneumonia with findings of multiple ground\u2010glass opacities (GGO) in bilateral lungs (Figure 1A). He was kept in isolation at home and separated from his family members. Due to the shortage of the test kits, real\u2010time reverse\u2010transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT\u2010PCR) assay for detection of coronavirus RNA was performed on his throat swabs on 3 February, which confirmed a positive result. From 1 to 4 February, apart from fever and cough, the patient developed shortness of breath. The follow\u2010up Chest CT displayed progressive GGO and consolidation in lungs (Figure 1B). On 4 February, he was referred, quarantined and treated in Wuhan Tongji Sino\u2010French New Town Hospital, a designated medical institution for the novel coronavirus infection.\nFigure 1\nOpen in figure viewerPowerPoint\nRepresentative chest CT images of the patient. CT, computed tomography\nOn admission, physical examination revealed a body temperature of 39\u00b0C, respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute and oxygen saturation of 80%, which reached 91% while the patient was given mask flow oxygen at a rate of 5 liters per minute. On supplemental oxygen, arterial blood gas analysis revealed: pH 7.41, PCO2 37.4 mm Hg, PO2 63.9 mm Hg, and 23.4\u2009mmol/L. Lymphopenia also got worse, with a lymphocyte count of 0.56\u2009\u00d7\u2009109/L and a low CD4+ T\u2010lymphocyte percentage at 4.75%. An antigen/antibody combination test on blood gave HIV\u2010positive result. Oral therapy with an anti\u2010HIV drug, lopinavir/ritonavir 400/100\u2009mg per dose twice daily for 12 days, as was advised by Chinese health authority for the treatment of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection, was started on admission.5 The patient also received moxifloxacin 400\u2009mg once daily for 7 days, \u03b3\u2010globulin 400\u2009mg/kg once daily for 3 days, and methilprednisolone 0.8\u2009mg/kg once daily for 3 days through intravenous route. On 9 February, the patient showed a marked clinical and radiological improvement (Figure 1C). His oxygen saturation measured by pulse maintained above 95% on supplemental oxygen via nasal cannula at 2 liters per minute. Two additional throat swabs were obtained on 15 February and both were tested negative for SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 RT\u2010PCR assay. The patient was in stable condition and discharged on 17 February. He was asked to keep isolated at home for two more weeks.\nWe described a patient with HIV recovered from a coronavirus\u2010related pneumonia.

However, from the details given in the report, there are doubts that this patient is living with HIV, and additional information would be needed to confirm it. In addition, the antiretroviral drug treatment mentioned is not within the standard guidelines for someone infected with HIV.\nInformation on how SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection impacts immunocompromised people, such as those people living with HIV (PLWH), off therapy or on therapy, is of urgent concern to those managing PLWH. In this case report, the authors describe a 61\u2010year\u2010old male, who was a heavy smoker with type II diabetes. He presented with recurrent fever and dry cough and was diagnosed with SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 pneumonia on a chest computed tomography scan. There is no other demographic information given in the case report, but he does not appear to fall into traditional HIV infection risk groups. There is no information on sexual history, drug use, or blood transfusion, which would assist in evaluating his HIV risk.

This is not an adequate regimen for someone diagnosed with HIV.\nWhile they end on an encouraging note about the patient, with a discussion about his improvement and subsequent isolation at home to recover, they do not discuss any additional follow up for his purported HIV infection with no mention of an adequate treatment regimen.\nIn this rapidly changing time, it is essential to monitor and discuss reports on COVID\u201019, and its\u2019 impact on the HIV\u2010infected community.

Since HIV infection is a common disease in Asia, the concurrence between HIV infection and other disease is an interesting problem. The present case by Zhu et al1 might be the first report on coinfection of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 and HIV. Zhu et al1 noted that \u201cHIV infection need to be regarded as vulnerable group\u201d to COVID\u201019. Nevertheless, there is no identified interrelationship between the two viral infections. In fact, despite there are many HIV\u2010infected patient and COVID\u201019 outbreak expands to cover a large area in Asia, there are few observations on infection among HIV\u2010infected patients. In our setting, Thailand, where the COVID\u201019 disease occurred after China, there is no case of infection among HIV\u2010infected patients despite there is an extremely high prevalence of HIV infection in this area. Regarding the case report by Zhu et al,1 the patient did not have antiviral therapy for HIV infection before.

On the other hand, there might be a lower risk than general population.", "25806": "We have read the article by Zhang et al1 published in the recent issue of the Journal of Medical Virology. Zhang et al have made a cross\u2010sectional survey of currently registered clinical trials concerning 2019\u2010novel coronavirus (2019\u2010nCoV), including the published literature. As such, they have given a preliminary assessment on the prospects of therapy for 2019\u2010nCoV. Although we commend the significance of this study and appreciate the authors for their important work, we are concerned about the optimistic conclusions of the study. Several issues and mistakes should be paid attention to.\n(a) In this study, the authors mentioned several times that the ability of carrying out clinical trials in China has improved, but there is no reliable basis for this conclusion. By searching the registration platform and literature database, the authors individually describe the status of clinical studies during the 2019\u2010nCOV and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak, and finally conclude that the awareness and ability to carry out clinical trials in China has improved during the 2019\u2010nCOV outbreak. The authors only performed descriptive statistics on the obtained studies and did not strictly appraise the quality of these studies, including methodological quality (sample size, randomization, allocation concealment, blindness etc.)2 and reporting quality (complete, clear, and transparent reporting).3 Therefore, the findings and analysis of this study were insufficient to conclude an improvement in clinical trials. In fact, a large proportion of these ongoing clinical trials are deficient in study design and/or selection of the clinical question. For example, Chen et al4 recently conducted a survey of 2019\u2010nCoV registered trials and found that the sample sizes of most clinical trials were too small to obtain the expected results.\n(b) This study is likely to have some limitations in searching for registered clinical trials and published literature. Only a single search term was used for each search and these terms were inconsistent across different databases. As an emerging disease, the name of the 2019\u2010nCoV pneumonia is multitudinous, including 2019\u2010nCoV, coronavirus disease\u201019 (COVID\u201019), and SARS\u2010CoV\u20102.5 We suspect the possibility of extensive omission if only one search term is employed.\n(c) The authors' interpretations of the findings were not rigorous and lack objectivity. For example, in the third section, the authors showed strong interests in, and expectations for, the results of the trials using tocilizumab and carrizumab as test drugs, but did not give an objective explanation to their significance. Candidate drugs should be selected on the theoretical basis and the results of previous studies (including in vivo, in vitro, and toxicity tests), and selecting a star drug is not always effective clinically. The reasons we assume the authors are interested in these two drugs may be related to their background in oncology. In another example, authors state in the fifth section that, \u201cwe support that improvement of clinical symptoms and prognosis of disease should be used as the most important indicators to evaluate the short\u2010term efficacy of experimental drugs.\u201d Researchers should instead select objective outcomes to measure effectiveness and safety in clinical trials, and the primary outcomes should be specifically designed according to the different populations (such as mild to moderate and severe patients). The authors supported using \u201cimprovement of clinical symptoms and prognosis of disease\u201d as the most important outcomes due to the urgency of the outbreak. However, the critical discussions leading to this opinion were lacking in the article, an example of which is the impact of the self\u2010limiting nature of the disease on these outcomes.\n(d) There is a minor mistake in the bibliographic citation. The first clinical evidence of tumor patients was published in \u201cLancet Oncology,\u201d6 rather than the \u201cNew England Journal.\u201d\nRegardless, we appreciate Zhang et al for their timely sharing of ongoing clinical studies in China and hope our comments can contribute to a more accurate interpretation of these clinical studies.

Although evidence of coronavirus (CoV) infection has been identified in children with encephalitis,1 and nucleic acid of CoVs can be demonstrated in human brain,2, 3 isolation of infectious virus, or detection of virus by PCR in the context of a compatible clinical illness is only rarely reported the literature.4 Human CoVs (HCoV) can infect CNS cell types in culture5 and can cause encephalitis in newborn mice,6 but despite this apparent biological basis for HCoVs causing CNS disease in humans, no definitive link between HCoVs and human nervous system disease has been made.7\nLi et al8 have proposed that severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)\u2010CoV\u20102 can enter the brain, and this might be the cause of the respiratory failure seen in patients with COVID\u201019. They suggest that patients with COVID\u201019 need ventilation because they \u201ccannot breathe spontaneously.\u201d However, this is likely not the case. Patients with pneumonia typically develop hypoxic, or type 1 respiratory failure, with low CO2 levels and a raised respiratory rate. They can breathe spontaneously but the increased work of breathing in the face of poorly functioning lungs becomes too great to sustain. Artificial ventilation takes away the work of breathing from the patient until the lung has recovered sufficiently for the patient to breathe on their own. During ventilatory support, patients can often still initiate breaths, which are then supported by the ventilator. This is not suggestive of brain dysfunction. Brain failure leading to failure of breathing usually manifests as reduced respiratory rate, with low oxygen and high CO2 due to ventilatory failure (type 2 respiratory failure). This may be accompanied by other signs of brain dysfunction. These are not reported to any great degree in any of the case series of patients from China.9 The only case series of neurological symptoms reported to date mostly nonspecific symptoms that do not necessarily imply CNS disease,10 although there was one report of ataxia and one of seizures, which is intriguing.\nMore convincing evidence of brain dysfunction caused by SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 would include specific focal neurological defects, or type 2 respiratory failure (especially if it occurred with little in the way of lung disease) This should be accompanied by detection of virus in cerebrospinal fluid by PCR or, ideally, viral culture.\nIt remains plausible that SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 can enter the CNS and cause disease in humans. But if so, this is a rare event. Although clinicians should be vigilant for CNS involvement with COVID\u201019, as they should be for any new disease, at present there is no good evidence that CNS disease occurs with SARS\u2010CoV\u20102, nor is it frequent with any human coronavirus.ACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nLT is supported by the Wellcome Trust (Grant number 205228/Z/16/Z) and the NIHR Health Protection Research Unit in Emerging and Zoonotic Infections (HPRU\u2010EZI) at the University of Liverpool in partnership with Public Health England (PHE), in collaboration with Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine and University of Oxford.

Since December 2019, different cases of pneumonia of unknown origin associated with permanence at the Wuhan market in China have been reported.3, 4 A new coronavirus, named 2019\u2010nCoV, belonging to the Orthocoronavirinae subfamily, distinct from MERS\u2010CoV and SARS\u2010CoV, was described.5 To date, a total of 1975 pneumonia cases have been confirmed in China (the State Council Information Office in Beijing, capital of China, 26 January 2020).6, 7 Animal to human transmission is considered the origin of epidemics, as many patients declared to have visited a local fish and wild animal market in Wuhan in November. Quite recently, evidence has been gathered for the animal to the human and interhuman transmission of the virus.7, 8\nAlthough prompt diagnosis and patient isolation are the hallmarks for initial control of this new epidemic, molecular epidemiology, evolutionary models, and phylogenetic analysis can help estimate genetic variability and the evolutionary rate, which in turn have important implications for disease progression as well as for drug and vaccine development. In this short report, we provide a phylogenetic tree of the 2019\u2010nCoV and identify sites of positive or negative selection pressure in distinct regions of the virus.2 MATERIAL AND METHODS\nThe complete genomes of 15 2019\u2010nCoV sequences have been downloaded from GISAID (https://www.gisaid.org/) and GenBank (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/). A dataset has been built using five highly similar sequences for SARS, two sequences for the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), and five highly similar sequences for bat SARS\u2010like coronavirus. The percentage of similarity has been identified using a basic local alignment search tool (https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi); eventually duplicated sequences have been excluded from the datasets. The dataset including 27 sequences has been aligned using multiple sequence alignment online tool9 and manually edited using BioEdit program v7.0.5.10\nMaximum likelihood (ML) methods were employed for the analyses because they allow for testing different phylogenetic hypotheses by calculating the probability of a given model of evolution generating the observed data and by comparing the probabilities of nested models by the likelihood ratio test. The best\u2010fitting nucleotide substitution model was chosen by jModeltest software.11 ML tree was reconstructed using generalized time\u2010reversible plus gamma distribution and invariant sites (+G+I) as an evolutionary model using MEGA\u2010X.12\nThe adaptive evolution server (http://www.datamonkey.org/) was used to find eventual sites of positive or negative selection. For this purpose, the following test has been used: fast unconstrained Bayesian approximation (FUBAR).13 This test allowed us to infer the site\u2010specific pervasive selection, the episodic diversifying selection across the region of interest, and to identify episodic selection at individual sites.14 The statistically significant positive or negative selection was based on P value less than .05.14\nHomology models have been built relying on the website SwissModel.15 Structural templates have been searched and validated using the software available within the SwissModel environment and HHPred.16 Homology models have been validated using the QMEAN tool.17 Three\u2010dimensional structures have been analyzed and displayed using PyMOL.18 To map the structural variability of the N, E, S, and M regions of the virus and their sites under selection pressure, homology modeling has been applied to the sequence of 2019\u2010nCoV.3 RESULTS\nThe ML phylogenetic tree, performed on whole genome sequences, is represented in Figure 1. In the tree, MERS virus sequences formed a distinct clade (clade I) from Bat SARS\u2010like coronavirus, SARS virus, and the 2019\u2010nCoV clustering together in clade II. This clade includes two different clusters: cluster IIa with Bat SARS\u2010like coronavirus and the 2019\u2010nCoV sequences, and cluster IIb with the bat SARS\u2010like coronavirus and the SARS virus sequences. The 2019\u2010nCoV is significantly and closely related only to the specific bat SARS\u2010like coronavirus isolated from Rhinolophus sinicus in 2015 in China (MG772934.1) (Figure 1).\nFigure 1\nOpen in figure viewerPowerPoint\nMaximum likelihood tree of 2019\u2010nCoV. Along the branches, an asterisk (*) indicates a statistical value from bootstrap (>97%)\nRegarding the FUBAR analysis performed on the N Region, significant (P\u2009<\u2009.05) pervasive episodic selection was found in two sites (380th and 410th nucleotide position using the reference sequence; Wuhan seafood market pneumonia virus isolate labeled Wuhan\u2010Hu\u20101 MN908947.3). On the 380th aminoacidic position in the Wuhan coronavirus sequence, there is a glutamine residue instead of an asparagine residue, whereas on the 410th aminoacidic position in Wuhan coronavirus sequence, there is a threonine residue instead of an alanine residue. A significant (P\u2009<\u2009.05) pervasive negative selection in six sites (14%) has been evidenced and confirmed by FUBAR analysis. Concerning the sequences in clade II, on the 409th aminoacidic position in the Wuhan coronavirus sequence, there is glutamine instead of an asparagine residue, whereas, on the 380th aminoacidic position in Wuhan coronavirus sequence, there is a threonine residue instead of an alanine. A significant (P\u2009<\u2009.05) pervasive negative selection in six sites (14%) has been evidenced and confirmed by FUBAR analysis.\nOn the S region, a significant (P\u2009<\u2009.05) pervasive episodic selection was found in two different sites (536th and 644th nucleotide position using the reference sequence; the Wuhan seafood market pneumonia virus isolate labeled Wuhan\u2010Hu\u20101 MN908947.3). For the sequences in clade II, on the 536th aminoacidic position in the Wuhan coronavirus sequence, there is an asparagine residue instead of an aspartic acid residue, whereas, on the 644th aminoacidic position in Wuhan coronavirus sequence, there is a threonine residue instead of an alanine residue. A significant (P\u2009<\u2009.05) pervasive negative selection in 1065 sites (87%) has been evidenced and confirmed by FUBAR analysis, suggesting that the S region could be highly conserved.\nNo sites under positive selection sites have been found in the E and M regions.\nThe N region of the 2019\u2010nCoV homology model has been built using a SARS coronavirus nucleocapsid protein structure (2jw8.1) as the statistical test has shown that this is the most stable and similar model among the other possible structures (Ramachandran favored 90.52%, GMQE 0.17, QMEAN \u22122.43), whereas, for the S region, the 2019\u2010nCoV homology model has been built using a SARS coronavirus spike glycoprotein (6acc.1) for the same reason (Ramachandran favored 87.87%, GMQE 0.83, QMEAN \u22123.14) (Figure 3).\nFigure 2\nOpen in figure viewerPowerPoint\nCartoon model of the structural superposition between the homology model of the 2019\u2010nCoV in blue and the nucleocapsid protein of SARS coronavirus (PDB code 2jw8.1) in orange.

The red circle highlights the presence of a variable region on the 2019\u2010nCoV at the beginning of the protein, whereas the blue square highlights the presence of two beta\u2010sheets on the 2019\u2010nCoV (401:KYR and 440:LND) that are not present on the SARS\u2010CoV structure; SARS, severe acute respiratory syndrome\nThe further structural and molecular analysis of the Nucleocapsid region of the 2019\u2010nCoV (MN908947.3) has highlighted that 2019\u2010nCoV and the bat SARS\u2010like coronavirus (MG772934.) share the same aminoacidic sequence near the 309th position (SKQLQQ,) whereas the SARS reference genome has a different aminoacidic sequence (SRQLQN). The same results have been found in the 380th aminoacidic position (KADET for 2019\u2010nCoV and bat SARS\u2010like coronavirus and KTDEA for the SARS reference genome). In particular, in this case, the 2019\u2010nCoV has a polar amino acid, whereas the SARS has a nonpolar amino acid (Figure 2).\nRegarding the sites under positive selective pressure found on the spike glycoprotein, the results have shown that the 536th aminoacidic position in 2019\u2010nCoV has an asparagine residue, whereas the bat SARS\u2010like coronavirus has a glutamine residue. The SARS virus, instead, has an aspartic acid residue. On the 644th aminoacidic position in 2019\u2010nCoV sequence, there is a threonine residue, whereas the bat SARS\u2010like virus has a serine residue. The SARS virus, however, has an alanine residue.4 DISCUSSION\nThe data reported above show that the new 2019\u2010nCoV significantly clustered with a sequence from the bat SARS\u2010like coronavirus isolated in 2015. Moreover, in the phylogenetic tree, these two sequences are separated from the other bat SARS\u2010like coronavirus sequences, suggesting that this bat SARS\u2010like coronavirus is homologous and genetically more similar to the 2019\u2010nCoV than to the other sequences of Bat SARS\u2010like coronavirus. This supports the hypothesis that the transmission chain began from the bat and reached the human. All other genomic sequences represented in the phylogenetic tree, also including SARS and MERS coronavirus, clustered separately, thus excluding the fact that the virus involved in the actual epidemic could belong to these subgenuses. The structural analysis of two important viral proteins, the nucleocapsid and the spike\u2010like nucleoprotein (protein S), confirmed the significant similarity of the new coronavirus with the bat\u2010like SARS coronavirus and its difference from SARS coronavirus.\nFrom the selective pressure and structural analysis, mutations of surface proteins, as the spike protein S, and of nucleocapsid N protein conferring stability to the viral particle have been shown. The viral spike protein is responsible for virus entry into the cell after by binding to a cell receptor and membrane fusion, two key steps in viral infection and pathogenesis. The N protein is a structural protein involved in virion assembly, playing a pivotal role in virus transcription and assembly efficiency. Mutation of these proteins could determine two important characteristics of the coronavirus isolated during the 2019\u2010nCoV epidemic: a higher ability to infect and enhanced pathogenicity than the bat\u2010like SARS coronavirus but lower pathogenicity than SARS coronavirus. These features can explain the 2019\u2010nCoV zoonotic transmission and its initial lower severity than SARS epidemic. These results do not exclude the fact that further mutation due to positive selective pressure, led by the epidemic evolution, could favor an enhancement of pathogenicity and transmission of this novel virus.\nRecently, Ji et al8 described homologous recombination within the spike glycoprotein of 2019\u2010nCoV favoring cross\u2010species transmission and suggested snake as probable virus reservoir for human infection because its resampling similarity codon usage bias is more similar to Bungarus multicinctus snake compared with other animals and humans. In a previous article, it has been proven that compositional properties, mutation pressure, natural selection, gene expression, and dinucleotides, affect the codon usage bias of Bungarus species.19\nThese data, along with analysis from our study, enforcing bat origin of infection, could clarify the transmission dynamics of the 2019\u2010nCoV, supporting infection control policy during the ongoing epidemic.", "25936": "Purpose\nThe purpose of this study was to detect severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS\u2010CoV\u20102) ribonucleic acid (RNA) in urine and blood specimens, and anal and oropharyngeal swabs from patients with confirmed SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection, and correlated positive results with clinical findings.Methods\nPatients with confirmed SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infections were included in this study. Patients' demographic and clinical data were recorded. Quantitative real\u2010time polymerase chain reaction was used to detect SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 RNA in urine and blood specimens, and anal and oropharyngeal swabs. The study is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (No. NCT04279782, 19 February, 2020).Results\nSARS\u2010CoV\u20102 RNA was present in all four specimen types, though not all specimen types were positive simultaneously. The presence of viral RNA was not necessarily predictive of clinical symptoms, for example, the presence of viral RNA in the urine did not necessarily predict urinary tract symptoms.Conclusions\nSARS\u2010CoV\u20102 can infect multiple systems, including the urinary tract. Testing different specimen types may be useful for monitoring disease changes and progression, and for establishing a prognosis.1 INTRODUCTION\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS\u2010CoV\u20102), which was first identified in Wuhan, China, has spread in almost every country in the world. On 30 January, 2020, World Health Organization (WHO) declared SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection as a global health emergency. There have been 2\u2009074\u2009529 confirmed cases of COVID\u201019 around the world, including 139\u2009378 (6.72%) deaths, reported to WHO on 17 April, 2020.1\nSARS\u2010CoV\u20102 is similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS\u2010CoV), which spread globally from November 2002 to July 2003,2 and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, which was first reported in Saudi Arabia in 2012.3 A prospective study enrolled 41 patients with laboratory\u2010confirmed SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection. All respiratory specimens from them were positive for SARS\u2010CoV\u20102, but blood specimens from only six of them were positive.4 In the first case in the United States, the nasopharyngeal swab, oropharyngeal swab, serum, urine, and stool specimens were examined for SARS\u2010CoV\u20102. The nasopharyngeal swab, oropharyngeal swab, and stool specimens were positive.5 Despite a vast amount of ongoing research, the mechanism of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection and the propensity for organ invasion is not known. The relations between clinical manifestations, organ system involvement, and the presence of viral ribonucleic acid (RNA) in specimens such as blood and urine are not known. Understanding these relations may help to improve the early diagnosis rate and reduce the spread of the disease.\nThus, the purpose of this study was to determine the presence of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 RNA in the urine, blood, anal swab, and oropharyngeal swab specimens of patients with confirmed SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infections, and examine the relations of positive results with clinical manifestations.2 MATERIALS AND METHODS\n2.1 Patients\nPatients with suspected SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infections who were admitted to the isolation unit of the Third Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat\u2010sen University were potentially eligible for inclusion in the study. After admission, oropharyngeal swabs were obtained and sent to the local Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) for detection of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 RNA. A positive result was considered laboratory confirmation of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection, and patients with a laboratory\u2010confirmed diagnosis of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection were included in the study.6 The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the Third Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat\u2010sen University, and all patients provided voluntarily, signed written informed consent for participation in the study. The study is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (No. NCT04279782, 19 February, 2020).\n2.2 SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 RNA detection\nPatient urine, blood, anal swabs, and pharyngeal swab specimens were obtained and stored between 2 and 8\u00b0C until detection of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 RNA. Briefly, SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 RNA was isolated from a 600\u2009\u03bcL sample using a Nucleic Acid Extraction and Purification Kit (SUPI\u20101017; Supbio, Guangzhou, China), according to the manufacturer's protocol. The levels of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 RNA were detected by quantitative real\u2010time polymerase chain reaction (qRT\u2010PCR) using a SLAN\u201096P Real\u2010time PCR Detection System (Hongshi, Shanghai, China). The TaqMan probe method was used with a SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 RNA Detection Kit (SUPI\u20100509; Supbio). The primers and probe were designed to detect the N gene.\n2.3 Data collection\nPatients' demographic and clinical data were recorded. Clinical data and information obtained included epidemiological history, underlying diseases, signs and symptoms, blood cell counts and biochemical test results, chest computed tomography (CT) results, and the levels of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 RNA of the four specimens.3 RESULTS\n3.1 Baseline characteristics\nOf 74 patients admitted to the isolation unit with suspected SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infections from 22 January, 2020 to 29 February, 2020, 13 were confirmed diagnosed with SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infections by the CDC using qualitative nucleic acid detection, and nine patients were enrolled in this study (rest four patients were transferred to another hospital without collecting their specimens). The average age of the nine patients was 38.9\u2009\u00b1\u200911.8 years, and there were five females and four males. Eight of the patients had a clear epidemiological history, including contact with a patient with a documented infection within the past 14 days, or living in a region with a high infection rate. The other patient did not have a clear epidemiological history. Only one patient had comorbidities of hypertension and hyperthyroidism. The most common symptoms were fever (100% of patients) and cough (67% of patients). Other symptoms included sore throat (33%), fatigue (22%), and diarrhea (11%). No patients complained of dyspnea or urinary tract symptoms. Baseline characteristics of the nine patients infected with SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 are shown in Table 1.\nTable 1.

The results showed that the white blood cell counts were normal in all nine patients, but the lymphocytes decreased in four patients. All patients had a partial arterial oxygen pressure of more than 80\u2009mm Hg, and no patients had any indications of hypoxia. Aspartate aminotransferase and creatine kinase levels slightly increased in one patient (Patient 9) (37\u2009U/L and 186\u2009U/L, respectively). Tests of liver and renal function, myocardial enzymes, and prothrombin time of the other eight patients were normal. C\u2010reactive protein increased in six patients, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate increased in five patients. Procalcitonin level was normal in all patients. Influenza A and B antigen, mycoplasma antigen, and respiratory syncytial virus antigen were negative in all patients. In all patients, chest CT showed ground\u2010glass changes but no evidence of lesion consolidation.\n3.3 Quantitative real\u2010time polymerase chain reaction analysis\nThe results of qRT\u2010PCR analysis for the detection of the SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 N gene in urine, blood, anal swabs, and oropharyngeal swabs specimens are shown in Table 2, which indicated that viral RNA was detectable in all four specimen types. Of the nine patients, seven were positive for oropharyngeal swab specimens, two were positive for anal swabs specimens, two were positive for blood specimens, and one was positive for urine specimens. All the four specimens were negative in Patient 1 on day 15 after symptom onset. Oropharyngeal swab specimen was positive and the rest three specimens were negative in Patient 2 on day 17 after symptom onset. Oropharyngeal swab specimen was positive and the rest three specimens were negative in Patient 3 on day 8 after symptom onset. Blood and oropharyngeal swab specimens were positive and the rest two specimens were negative in Patient 4 on day 3 after symptom onset. All four specimens were negative in Patient 5 on day 10 after symptom onset. Oropharyngeal swab specimen was positive and the rest three specimens were negative in Patient 6 on day 8 after symptom onset. Urine and oropharyngeal swab specimens were positive and the rest two specimens were negative in Patient 7 on day 7 after symptom onset. Blood, oropharyngeal swab, and anal swab specimens were positive and urine specimen was negative in Patient 8 on day 3 after symptom onset. Oropharyngeal swab and anal swab specimens were positive and the rest two specimens were negative in Patient 9 on day 3 after symptom onset.\nTable 2.

Seven patients were also treated with arbidol, and one patient was administered interferon alfa inhalation. Four patients required supplemental oxygen support. At the time this report was prepared, five patients had recovered and were discharged, and four patients were still hospitalized with improvements in their conditions.4 DISCUSSION\nThe pathogenic mechanism of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection is still unclear. Current evidence indicates that it can invade multiple organ systems, including the respiratory system, digestive system, and hematological system.4, 5, 7 Whether it can invade the urinary system has not been determined. A study reported the presence of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 in 1070 specimens of bonchoalveolar lavage fluid, sputum, nasal and pharyngeal swabs, fibrobronchoscope brush biopsy, feces, and blood from 205 patients. However, none of the 72 urine specimens tested positive.8 The current study is the first in which SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 RNA was identified in the urine of an infected patient, though the patient did not have any urinary tract symptoms.\nInterestingly, not all patients with positive anal swab specimens had diarrhea, and not all patients with positive urine specimens had urinary tract symptoms. Thus, it appears that SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 can invade the urinary system, hematological system, and digestive system; however, symptoms related to infection of these body systems may not be present. In patients with mild infections, the disease may be self\u2010limiting.\nThe study has some limitations. First, only nine patients were enrolled in the study. Second, four types of specimens were detected for SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 RNA once in the course without dynamic examinations.\nSARS\u2010CoV\u20102 can infect multiple systems, including the urinary tract. Testing different specimen types may be useful for monitoring disease changes and progression, and for establishing a prognosis. Testing different types of specimens may be useful even without corresponding clinical symptoms.ACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThe authors thank all the medical staff of the isolation unit of Third Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat\u2010sen University.

Cases detected elsewhere have either been infected in the Middle East or been part of a chain of transmission originating in the Middle East. The disease is due to infection with the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS\u2010CoV), previously known as novel coronavirus 2012 or HCoV\u2010EMC.1, 2 Human infection is thought to follow exposure to infected camels or human\u2010to\u2010human transmission primarily in healthcare settings. As of March 2018, the World Health Organization (WHO) had been notified of 2143 laboratory\u2010confirmed cases of infection with MERS\u2010CoV globally, including 750 deaths.3\nApart from epidemiologic clustering and virus\u2010specific diagnostic testing, there is little clinically that distinguishes MERS\u2010CoV infection from other severe viral respiratory infections such as severe acute respiratory syndrome or influenza. Nucleic acid testing (NAT) is the preferred method for detecting MERS\u2010CoV. Suitable specimens for testing include lower respiratory tract samples (LRT), nasopharyngeal swabs, oropharyngeal swabs, nasal washes, and nasal aspirates. The LRT samples have been shown to contain the highest viral loads, possibly due to virus tropism for LRT cells.4, 5 Confirmation using real\u2010time reverse\u2010transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT\u2010PCR) assays require a positive result for at least two different specific targets on the MERS\u2010CoV genome using a validated assay, or a positive rRT\u2010PCR result for one specific target on the MERS\u2010CoV genome plus MERS\u2010CoV sequence confirmation from a separate viral genomic target.6 Nucleic acid sequencing of an amplicon has also been recommended when there are discordant results on different assays,6, 7 confirming the specificity of the target.\nIt is important that laboratories develop technical capability to accurately and promptly identify MERS\u2010CoV to implement appropriate infection control and isolation procedures to reduce the potential for transmission, and aid a rapid epidemiological investigation. External quality assessment programs are an essential tool for monitoring the diagnostic proficiency of laboratories and providing results that allow implementation of improved testing, thereby strengthening global capability in reducing spread. The WHO initiated a single round Proficiency Testing Program (PTP) for the detection of MERS\u2010CoV by PCR, which was conducted in the first half of 2015 by the Royal College of Pathologists of Australasia Quality Assurance Programs (RCPAQAP).2 METHODS\n2.1 Participation\nThe WHO identified 133 laboratories from 98 countries in all six WHO regions as potential participants. One hundred and two laboratories confirmed their interest and 99 subsequently confirmed their ability to receive the panel. A total of 96 laboratories located in 79 different countries returned results and participated in the PTP (Table 1). The additional verification step was introduced to ensure laboratories had all the documentation and permits in place that were required to import the material into their country.\nTable 1.

This was made up of nine specimens (A to I) of inactivated (gamma irradiation; 50\u2009kGy) MERS\u2010CoV, human coronavirus OC43, human coronavirus 229E, and a negative control (specimen I), as well as two synthetic specimens (J and K) containing in vitro RNA transcripts. RCPAQAP have used similar transcripts in previous PT panels, and have shown that they are safe, stable, and reliable.8 The design of these transcripts was based on the complete genome sequence of human betacoronavirus 2c EMC/2012 (GenBank accession number: JX869059.2). The following five regions of the MERS\u2010CoV genome were included in the two synthetic specimens: a 385\u2010nucleotide region upstream of the E protein gene (upE) covering nucleotides 27\u2009312 to 27\u2009696; 500 nucleotides of the open reading frame 1a (ORF1a) starting at nucleotide 10\u2009923; a 502\u2010nucleotide region of the open reading frame 1b (ORF1b) starting at nucleotide 18\u2009054, as well as two regions; one from the RNA\u2010dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) starting at nucleotide 14\u2009994 and another from the nucleocapsid (N) protein gene starting at nucleotide 29\u2009523, with a length of 392 and 491 nucleotides, respectively. The five RNA transcripts were designed to yield positive results in RT\u2010PCR assays that were originally published by Corman et al,6, 7 which formed the basis of the \u201cWHO interim guidance\u2014laboratory testing for Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus.\u201d8 Specimen J contained all five RNA transcripts, whilst specimen K contained a single transcript covering upE. This was designed to challenge participants with a sample (K) that would yield an equivocal result, as confirmatory testing to initial screening would return negative.\nAll specimens provided were lyophilized and tested for homogeneity and stability. Homogeneity was confirmed, and no significant sample degradation was detected after storage for 7 days at 37\u00b0C and subsequent 21 days at \u221280\u00b0C. The MERS\u2010CoV strain used was provided by Public Health England, and all coronaviruses included in the panel were prepared at the Victorian Infectious Diseases Reference Laboratory (VIDRL) in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. Following gamma irradiation of the viruses, inactivation was confirmed and viral RNA was quantified using real\u2010time PCR.8 The relative measure of the concentration of virus\u2010specific target was determined by generating standard curves using a set of MERS\u2010CoV\u2010specific and HCoV\u2010specific primers to quantify the genome equivalents (GE) copies per millilitre of each specimen.6, 7 Three external referee laboratories confirmed sample characteristics.\n2.3 Assessment criteria\nParticipants were requested to test all specimens of the PT panel and\n1.\nrule out or confirm the presence of MERS\u2010CoV;\n2.\nrule out or confirm the presence of a HCoV other than MERS\u2010CoV;\n3.\nidentify the HCoV, if present.\nParticipating laboratories were assessed on their capacity to correctly analyze specimens A to I using their existing PCR detection protocols and reagents. This was performed qualitatively, with correct responses assigned on the basis of reporting the expected result eg MERS\u2010CoV ruled out, other HCoV confirmed present and identified as human coronavirus 229E. Performance was assessed separately for the detection of MERS\u2010CoV and the detection and identification of other HCoVs.\nResults submitted for synthetic specimens J and K were not scored, as participants were likely to obtain varying results depending on the gene region and PCR marker used by the testing laboratory. In particular, participants performing MERS\u2010CoV\u2010specific testing according to the assay developed by the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (US CDC) would expect a negative result for specimen J, as this assay targets a region of the N gene that is different to the region that was used to design the in vitro RNA transcript included in specimen J.10 These specimens were included as they could provide interesting information in regard to how participating laboratories handle equivocal test results.3 RESULTS\n3.1 Capability to detect MERS\u2010CoV and other HCoVs by PCR\nOverall, 76 of 96 (79.2%) laboratories correctly reported the presence or absence of MERS\u2010CoV in all nine scored specimens (Figure 1). An additional 10 (10.4%) laboratories correctly reported the presence or absence of MERS\u2010CoV in 8 of 9 scored specimens, whilst 10 (10.4%) had at least two discordant results (Table 2). The absence of MERS\u2010CoV in the negative control sample (specimen I) was correctly reported by 88 of 96 (91.7%) participants (Table 3). Five participants reported false\u2010positive results, and three laboratories did not report a result for this specimen (I) for unknown reasons.\nFigure 1\nOpen in figure viewerPowerPoint\nParticipant performance in the nine scored specimens for Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus\nTable 2.

To account for this variability, performance was assessed separately for the detection of MERS\u2010CoV and the detection and identification of other HCoVs. There were 69 of 96 (71.9%) laboratories that returned results regarding other HCoVs, with 27 (28.1%) correctly confirming or ruling out the presence of other HCoVs in all nine specimens (Table 2) and 29 (30.2%) correctly identifying the two other HCoVs included in specimen B (HCoV\u2010OC43), specimen C (HCoV\u2010229E), and specimen H (MERS\u2010CoV & HCoV\u2010229E). A summary of the performance of laboratories for all specimens is presented in Table 3.\n3.2 Limit of detection for MERS\u2010CoV\u2010specific PCR\nThe PT panel included a 10\u2010fold dilution series (specimens D, E, F, and G), covering MERS\u2010CoV RNA concentrations ranging from 4.3\u2009\u00d7\u2009103 to 4.3\u2009\u00d7\u2009100 GE/\u00b5L. There were 94 of 96 participants (97.9%) reporting a correct positive result for specimens with RNA concentrations ranging from 4.3\u2009\u00d7\u2009103 to 4.3\u2009\u00d7\u2009101 GE/\u00b5L and 92 of 96 participants (95.8%) reporting a correct positive result for all four specimens, including the specimen with the lowest viral load (Table 3).\n3.3 Synthetic specimens\nEighty\u2010one of ninety\u2010six (84.4%) laboratories confirmed the presence of MERS\u2010CoV in specimen J, which contained all five in\u2010vitro RNA transcripts. For this specimen, seven (7.3%) laboratories ruled out the presence of MERS\u2010CoV and eight (8.3%) participants did not specify. Specimen K contained one in\u2010vitro RNA transcript, for which 49 of 96 (51.0%) laboratories reported the presence of MERS\u2010CoV. Twenty\u2010eight (29.2%) and 19 (19.8%) participants ruled out or did not specify the presence of MERS\u2010CoV, respectively (Table 3).\n3.4 Methods used for the detection of MERS\u2010CoV\nAll 96 participating laboratories tested the specimens of the PT panel for the presence or absence of MERS\u2010CoV. The gene targets used by participants to confirm or rule out the presence of MERS\u2010CoV in each of the 11 specimens were upE, ORF1a, ORF1b, N, and RdRp (Table 4).\nTable 4.

Examination of the set of gene targets that were used showed most participants either followed the WHO interim guidance\u2014laboratory testing for Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus protocol,8 or the assay developed by US CDC.10 Both protocols recommend an initial screening assay against the gene target upE, with subsequent confirmation by one more PCR assays for the gene targets ORF1a/ORF1b/N (WHO) or N2/N3/RdRp (US CDC). In accordance with these two recommendations, 93.9% of participants performed at least two PCR assays per specimen to confirm or rule out the presence of MERS\u2010CoV (Figure 2). TaqMan\u2010based real\u2010time PCR was the most commonly used PCR method with an average of 95.1% and 93.9% of participants using this method in the initial screening assay and the confirmatory second assay, respectively. Participants performing three or more PCR assays included conventional gel\u2010based PCR assays, as well as nested and heminested assays in their testing regimen. The most commonly used PCR platforms include ABI real\u2010time PCR systems (42 participants), Roche LightCycler (21 participants), Bio\u2010Rad real\u2010time PCR systems (11 participants), and the Qiagen rotor\u2010gene (nine participants) and Stratagene systems (five participants). The majority of participating laboratories relied on manual RNA extraction using the Qiagen QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (36 participants), followed by automated systems from BioMerieux (NUCLISENS EASYMAG) and Roche (Magna Pure System) used by 15 and five participating laboratories, respectively. A range of manual RNA extraction systems from Qiagen, Macherey\u2010Nagel, and Roche were used by seven, five, and four participants, respectively.\nFigure 2\nOpen in figure viewerPowerPoint\nAverage number of polymerase chain reaction assays performed per specimen, per laboratory4 DISCUSSION\nThe PTP provides insight into the diagnostic methodology and performance of laboratories in detecting MERS\u2010CoV worldwide. The high level of concordance between the 96 participating laboratories suggests a high global capacity to detect MERS\u2010CoV. Despite this, a small number of laboratories performed poorly and the results of this PTP identify opportunities for future improvement. Incorrect results could be attributed to three main causes: (i) cross contamination, (ii) low sensitivity of the NAT (predominantly PCR), or (iii) transcription error. A number of laboratories reported a MERS\u2010CoV false positive result for the human coronavirus samples (specimens B and C) and the negative sample (specimen I). These results were all reported with high Ct values, suggesting cross contamination of samples. There were four participants reporting false negative results for specimen G, which contained the lowest concentration of MERS\u2010CoV. These participants consistently reported unusually high Ct values for specimens across the panel, indicating that these laboratories had relatively low sensitivity in their PCR assay and may not have been able to detect MERS\u2010CoV at lower concentrations. This finding is similar to that of two previous external quality assessments, which reported some laboratories to have reduced assay sensitivity when assessed on a 10\u2010fold MERS\u2010CoV dilution panel.11, 12 These studies also demonstrated a high overall capacity for laboratories to detect MERS\u2010CoV in China,11 and worldwide.12 Similarly, a study performed during the 2015 Korean outbreak reported a 100% MERS\u2010CoV detection score amongst 47 participants.13 However, the panel in this study only consisted of three specimens, limiting their assessment of assay sensitivity. Both the Korean and Chinese external quality assessments differed from this PTP in that they did not include other human coronaviruses for the assessment of assay specificity. Access to and participation in future quality assurance (QA) programs will provide the opportunity for improvement at a technical level. Offering an ongoing PTP for the detection of MERS\u2010CoV and other human coronaviruses by PCR will ensure that this capacity will remain appropriate and provide continuing opportunities for improvement.\nResults for the detection and identification of other human coronaviruses were less conclusive, with just 28.1% and 30.2% of laboratories scoring correctly in all samples, respectively. However these results were unsurprising, as a large proportion of participants reported they had no or limited capability to test for human coronaviruses other than MERS\u2010CoV before the beginning of the PTP. The capacity to test for related organisms is important in distinguishing pathogens such as MERS\u2010CoV from genetically related, but less virulent organisms such as other human coronaviruses.\nThe two synthetic specimens containing MERS\u2010CoV complementary DNA were included in the PTP as they provided noninfectious, easily accessed, and scalable quantities of target analyte. Although these specimens were not scored, they were informative as for how participating laboratories handled equivocal test results. Specimen J contained five in vitro transcribed RNA transcripts, a design intended to give positive results for all NAT markers included in PCR protocols recommended by the WHO. Specimen K contained a single transcript covering upE, a design that challenged participants with a sample that would yield an equivocal result. Participants would only get a positive result in an initial screening assay against upE, while confirmatory tests of this initial screen would be negative. The protocol recommended by the WHO advises further specimens to be collected in the absence of a confirmatory result. The US CDC protocol recommends reporting of an equivocal result and contacting the CDC for consultation. In the context of this PTP, the expected result for specimen K would have been \u201cnot specified\u201d and a comment as for equivocal results and/or the necessity to collect and test a second sample. Interestingly, more than half of the participating laboratories reported the presence of MERS\u2010CoV in specimen K despite the fact that confirmatory NAT assays against targets other than upE were negative. Additionally, a small number of laboratories were found to be only performing an average of one PCR assay per sample. These results highlight the need for laboratories to follow a NAT regimen with at least two independent assays. Laboratories need to have detailed guidelines for MERS\u2010CoV PCR test interpretation as well as reporting instructions. By addressing these issues, it is anticipated that the global laboratory capacity for MERS\u2010CoV detection will be enhanced.\nEngaging international laboratories, especially those in countries with limited exposure to routine QA proved to be one of the major challenges in organizing and executing this PTP. Language barriers, limited resources, skepticism toward an unknown organization, as well as the need for laboratories to continue their routine testing alongside PTP sample testing most likely contributed to difficulties with engagement. Jurisdictional difficulties with specimen handling were also an administrative challenge. Despite the material not being infectious, several laboratories required a range of documentation such as import permits. Obtaining these documents was often time\u2010consuming, and in more than one instance required 8 weeks or longer before specimens could be received. The responses to these challenges need to include early engagement with laboratories, as much local interaction as possible with regional WHO support, and effective communication with customs and courier officials to avoid delays at the dispatch stage of the PTP. The strong support from the WHO regional offices was key to successfully running the PTP in 96 laboratories from 79 countries. Contracting three different courier services ensured efficient distribution of the PTP globally, with 85% of laboratories receiving the panel within 5 days of dispatch.\nIn conclusion, participating laboratories had a high overall capacity to detect MERS\u2010CoV. The PTP identified improvement opportunities at a technical level, including (i) the need for performance of confirmatory NAT assays, (ii) avoidance of cross contamination of samples, and (iii) care with clear identification of the particular coronavirus target and result. Laboratories need access to QA programs, and continued encouragement for engaging in these QA activities, which are in addition to, but important for their diagnostic functions. Facilitating involvement of laboratories in appropriate QA programs is essential to continuing accurate detection of pathogens. Accurate diagnosis is critical where a pathogen is infrequently seen, and detection may have significant community, public health, and social implications. Continuing involvement in well\u2010regulated QA programs, attention to technical details, and staff development can avoid significant laboratory error and unnecessary public health concern.ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nWe would like to thank all laboratories for participating in this study.

The virus is currently spreading fast in mainland China. By 25 January 2020, a total of 1975 cases have been confirmed nationwide with another 2684 cases suspected.5\nThe 2019\u2010nCoV is considered a relative of the deadly severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronaviruses, both of which are characterized by flu\u2010like symptoms, including fever, cough, and anhelation and can possibily transmit from animals to humans.6, 7 The SARS was traced to animals, including what was initially thought to be palm civets8 but was later identified as bats.9 The 2019\u2010nCoV was associated with contact with a local seafood market that illegally sold animals, including poultry, bats, marmots, and snakes in Wuhan. Two very recent studies have suggested bats10 or snakes11 to be the potential natural reservoir of 2019\u2010nCoV. However, based on the latest statement by WHO on 23 January 2020, the source of 2019\u2010nCoV is still unknown.12 The 2019\u2010nCoV appears to cause symptoms similar to SARS based on clinical data from the initial 41 cases13 and seems to be capable of spreading from humans to humans and between cities,14 according to two latest studies13, 14 published in Lancet on 24 January 2020.\nAlthough WHO suggested that the current event did not constitute a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC), they also indicated that the situation was urgent and needed further examination.12 At present, in context of a lack of definite and effective treatment, the most direct and effective way is to take protective measures, including improving personal hygiene, wearing a medical mask, having enough rest, maintaining ventilation, and avoiding crowd, to prevent the disease. Updating the understanding of the disease caused by the 2019\u2010nCoV infection is currently urgently needed. Thus, we conducted the current study with the aim to help health workers and the public recognize and quickly, effectively, and calmly deal with the disease.2 METHODS\n2.1 Data sources and searches\nA comprehensive search of Chinese and worldwide official websites and announcements1, 5, 15-24 was performed between 1 December 2019 and 9:30 am, 26 January 2020 (Beijing time). The relevant data of distribution of infection on each reported day including 31 December 2019,1 10 January 2020,15 20 January 2020,16 21 January 2020,17 22 January 2020,18, 19 23 January 2020,20, 21 24 January 2020,22, 23 and 25 January 20205, 24 were obtained.\n2.2 Statistical analysis\nRetrieved data were recorded into Microsoft\u00ae Excel for Mac (version 16.30) and analyzed. Continuous variables, including age, days to death, and so on, were expressed as median and range deviation. The Mann\u2010Whitney U test was utilized to compare significant differences among continuous data. The SPSS version 22.0 (SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL) was used for statistic analysis. P values less than .05 were considered statiscally significant. The EDraw Max version 9.3(EDraw Max lnc, Shenzhen, China) was used for cartography. Data from 20 January 2020,16 22 January 2020,18, 19 and 25 January 20205, 24 were utilized drawing the Chinese map16, 19, 24 and world map5, 16, 18, respectively.3 RESULTS\nThe distribution of 2019\u2010nCov infection in China and worldwide is shown in Table 1 and Figure 1.

Ten days later, on 20 January 2020,16 the number of infected cases increased to 217, of which 198 were in Wuhan, 14 in Guangdong, and 5 in Beijing. In addition, four cases were confirmed outside China (Thailand/Japan/South Korea, 2/1/1).16 The number of confirmed cases increased rapidly from 20 January 2020 to 440 with 9 deaths up to 21 January 202017; 571 with 17 deaths up to 22 January 2020;18 830 with 25 deaths up to 23 January 2020;20 and 1287 with 41 deaths up to 24 January 2020.22\nFrom the latest report as of 25 January 2020,5, 24 a total of 1975 patients fromm 30 provinces (autonomous regions and municipalities) were confirmed of 2019\u2010nCoV infection in mainland China with a total 56 deaths. The latest mortality was approximately 2.84% with a total of 2684 additional suspected cases.5 Three other involved Chinese regions reported 10 cases of confirmed infection (Hong Kong/Taiwan/Macau, 5/3/2).5 Besides, 23 cases were confirmed outside China (Thailand/Singapore/Malaysia/France/United States/Japan/South Korea/Vietnam/Nepal/Australia, 4/3/3/3/2/2/2/2/1/1) as of 25 January 2020.5\nPreviously, the China National Health Commission reported the details of the first 17 deaths up to 22 January 2020.18 As shown in Table 2, the deaths included 13 males and 4 females. The median age at death was 75 (range 48\u201089) years. Before admission, 11 cases were complicated with other diseases and 5 had past surgery history. Fever (64.7%) and cough (52.9%) were the most common first symptoms in deaths. The median number of days from first symptom to death was 14.0 (range 6\u201041), and it tended to be shorter among people aged 70 years or more (11.5 [range 6\u201019] days) than those aged less than 70 years (20 [range 10\u201041] days; P\u2009=\u2009.033).\nTable 2.

Another possible reason for the fast spreading would be the Spring Festival travel rush, in which thousands of millions of people were on the move heading home and the virus would definitely spread quickly, especially with those coming out from Wuhan.\nOur study also demonstrated that the 2019\u2010nCoV had caused a total 1975 infections and 56 deaths in 26 days since the first official announcement.1 The current mortality of the 2019\u2010nCoV is approximately 2.84%, which is lower than that of 9.6% of the SARS\u2010CoV that spread globally to 30 countries/regions, infected 8098 people, and killed 774 patients from November 2002 to July 2003,25 and lower than that of 34.4% of the MERS\u2010CoV, which spread globally to 27 countries/regions, infected 2494 people and killed 858 patients from September 2012 to September 2019.26 However, in the first 3 months from November 2002 to February 2003,27 Guangdong, China, had only witnessed a diagnosis of the atypical pneumonia initially considered chlamydia pneumoniae (later confirmed to be caused by SARS) in 305 cases with 5 deaths. Taken together, these facts show that although the current mortality is lower than that of the SARS\u2010CoV and the MERS\u2010CoV, it seems that the 2019\u2010nCoV is very contagious. The public should be cautious about the development of the disease.\nOur study also showed that the first occurred deaths were mainly among elderly people. Although most of them had comorbidities or a history of surgery before admission, the potential association of underlying medical conditions and 2019\u2010nCoV\u2010associated death was not clear. By far, the median number of days of first symptom to death was 14, which was comparable to that of 14 days (median) of MERS.28 For SARS, it was reported that the average duration of first symptoms to hospital admission was 3.8 days, and admission to death was 17.4 days for casualties.29 Our study also found that people 70 years or older had shorter median days (11.5 days) from the first symptom to death than those with ages below 70 years (20 days), demonstrating that elderly people might have faster disease progression than younger people. Similar results were found in SARS in that the mean duration from admission to death was 5.7 days for people aged 80 to 93 years, 9.4 days for those aged 60 to 79 years, and above 12.0 days for those under 60 years of age.29 It was also reported that older age (>60 years) was a risk factor that correlated with mortality in MERS.28 From the above, although a definite comparison could not be drawn, the public should pay attention to elderly people who might be more vulnerable to the 2019\u2010nCoV.\nCurrently there is a lack of definite and effective treatment. The health workers and public should be cautious in preventing and controlling the disease. The United States Center for Disease Control and Prevention released an updated and interim guidance30 and provided a patient under investigation (PUI) form,31 which was available for suspected cases. Patients falling under the following criteria should be considered a PUI in association with the 2019\u2010nCoV: first, those who had fever combined with symptoms of lower respiratory illness (eg, cough, breathing difficulties), and had Wuhan traveling history in the last 2 weeks before symptom onset or close contact with an ill person who was also under investigation for 2019\u2010nCoV. Second, those who had fever or had symptoms of lower respiratory illness (eg, cough, breathing difficulties), and close contact with an ill lab\u2010confirmed 2019\u2010nCoV patient.\nIn addition, the WHO also provided an interim guidance for infection prevention and control when a novel coronavirus was suspected32 and further improved the guidance by indicating that patients with mild symptoms and without chronic conditions or symptomatic patients no longer requiring hospitalization might be cared for in home environment.33 Another aspect worth noting is that health workers should minimize the possibility of exposure when collecting and transporting lab specimens of suspected infected patients.32, 34 A goggle was necessary when health workers were questioning patients at fever clinics or performing operations for suspected patients since the virus might infect the eye conjunctiva through droplets. It would be interesting to test if robotics might be used in questioning or treating the infected or suspected patients, which will definitely decrease the possibility of exposure of health workers.\nAlthough the etiology is still unclear, some scholars suggest that 2019\u2010nCoV and SARS/SARS\u2010like coronaviruses may share a common ancestor resembling the bat coronavirus HKU9\u20101.10 The 2019\u2010nCoV may interact with human ACE2 molecules via its S\u2010protein for human\u2010to\u2010human transmission.10 However, future studies are warranted to uncover the source of the virus and potential mechanisms for human\u2010to\u2010human transmission.5 CONCLUSION\nThe 2019\u2010nCoV infection is spreading fast with an increasing number of infected patients nationwide. The future development of the disease is not clear but the public should be cautious in dealing with the virus since it may be very contagious. The first occurred deaths were majorly elderly people who might have faster disease progression. The public should pay more attention to protecting elderly people who have contracted the virus.CONFLICT OF INTERESTS\nThe authors declare that there are no conflict of interests.", "25685": "1 INTRODUCTION\nDuring the end of 2019 and the beginning of 2020, multiple human cases of novel coronavirus infection were reported in relation to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market (South China Seafood City Food Market) in Wuhan, China. At 9 O'clock, 7 January 2020, the virus was identified as a novel coronavirus and officially named by the WHO as 2019\u2010nCoV, the new coronavirus in 2019.1 On 22 January 2020, a total of 314 confirmed case have been reported, and 6 patients were reported to have died.2 On 13, 16, and 21 January, respectively, Thailand, Japan, and Korea confirmed the detection of a human infection with 2019\u2010nCoV from China.2 In recent years, novel coronaviruses emerge periodically in different areas around the world. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS\u2010CoV) occurred in 2002, which reportedly infected 8422 people and caused 916 deaths worldwide during the epidemic. Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS\u2010CoV) was first identified in 2012, bringing a total of 1401 MERS\u2010CoV infections, and 543 (~39%) of which died.3, 5 All the infection cases and recent epidemics show that coronaviruses impose a continuous threat to human beings and the economy as they emerge unexpectedly, spread easily, and lead to catastrophic consequences.\nCoronaviruses are enveloped, nonsegmented, positive\u2010sense single\u2010stranded RNA virus genomes in the size ranging from 26 to 32\u2009kilobases, the largest known viral RNA genome. The virion has a nucleocapsid composed of genomic RNA and phosphorylated nucleocapsid (N) protein, which is buried inside phospholipid bilayers and covered by two different types of spike proteins: the spike glycoprotein trimmer (S) that can be found in all CoVs, and the hemagglutinin\u2010esterase (HE) that exists in some CoVs. The membrane (M) protein (a type III transmembrane glycoprotein) and the envelope (E) protein are located among the S proteins in the virus envelope. CoVs were given their name based on the characteristic crown\u2010like appearance. The structure of CoV virion is shown in Figure 1.\nFigure 1\nOpen in figure viewerPowerPoint\nCoronavirus particle. Coronaviruses are enveloped, nonsegmented, positive\u2010sense single\u2010stranded RNA virus genomes in the size ranging from 26 to 32 kilobases. The virion has a nucleocapsid composed of genomic RNA and phosphorylated nucleocapsid (N) protein, which is buried inside phospholipid bilayers and covered by the spike glycoprotein trimmer (S). The membrane (M) protein (a type III transmembrane glycoprotein) and the envelope (E) protein are located among the S proteins in the virus envelope\nThe coronavirus subfamily is genotypically and serologically divided into four genera, the \u03b1, \u03b2, \u0263, and \u03b4 coronaviruses. The \u03b2\u2010coronavirus can be further classified into four viral lineages, namely lineage A\u2010D. There are nearly 30 recognized CoVs that infect humans, mammals, fowl, and other animals. Human CoV infections are caused by \u03b1\u2010 and \u03b2\u2010CoVs. CoVs are common human pathogens, and 30% to 60% of the Chinese population is positive for anti\u2010CoV antibodies. The viral infections are generally associated with upper respiratory tract infections, of which the signs and symptoms commonly include fever, headache, and cough; some patients may have lower respiratory tract infections. In contrast, SARS\u2010CoV and MERS\u2010CoV infections may remain asymptomatic in the early stage until severe pneumonia, dyspnea, renal insufficiency, and even death (Figure 2).\nFigure 2\nOpen in figure viewerPowerPoint\nThe innate immune response and adaptive immune responses of Coronaviruses (CoV) infection during an infection. A, CoV infects macrophages, and then macrophages present CoV antigens to T cells. This process leads to T cell activation and differentiation, including the production of cytokines associated with the different T cell subsets (ie, Th17), followed by a massive release of cytokines for immune response amplification. The continued production of these mediators due to viral persistence has a negative effect on NK, and CD8 T cell activation. However, CD8 T cells produce very effective mediators to clear CoV. B, Attachment of CoV to DPP4R on the host cell through S protein leads to the appearance of genomic RNA in the cytoplasm. An immune response to dsRNA can be partially generated during CoV replication. TLR\u20103 sensitized by dsRNA and cascades of signaling pathways (IRFs and NF\u2010\u03baB activation, respectively) are activated to produce type I IFNs and proinflammatory cytokines. The production of type I IFNs is important to enhance the release of antiviral proteins for the protection of uninfected cells. Sometimes, accessory proteins of CoV can interfere with TLR\u20103 signaling and bind the dsRNA of CoV during replication to prevent TLR\u20103 activation and evade the immune response. TLR\u20104 might recognize S protein and lead to the activation of proinflammatory cytokines through the MyD88\u2010dependent signaling pathway. Virus\u2010cell interactions lead to the strong production of immune mediators. The secretion of large quantities of chemokines and cytokines (IL\u20101, IL\u20106, IL\u20108, IL\u201021, TNF\u2010\u03b2, and MCP\u20101) is promoted in infected cells in response to CoV infection. These chemokines and cytokines, in turn, recruit lymphocytes and leukocytes to the site of infection. Red lines refer to inhibitory effects. Green lines refer to activating effects\nHistopathological observations of pulmonary lesions in SARS cases not only show nonspecific inflammatory responses such as edema and inflammatory cell infiltration but also exhibit severe exfoliation of alveolar epithelial cells, alveolar septal widening, damage to alveolar septa, and alveolar space infiltration in a distinctly organized manner. Pathologically, inflammation includes degeneration (necrosis), infiltration, and hyperplasia. Thus, SARS\u2010CoV infection can cause pathological changes, degeneration, infiltration, and hyperplasia. Damage to the pulmonary interstitial arteriolar walls indicates that inflammatory response plays an important role throughout the course of disease in spites of the pathogenic effect of CoVs.\nAlthough the pathologies of SARS and MERS are not yet fully understood, viral and host factors play a key role in SARS\u2010CoV and MERS\u2010CoV infections. During virus infection, host factors trigger an immune response against the virus. However, it should be noted that immunopathogenesis is associated with an immune response out of control, which may result in pulmonary tissue damage, functional impairment, and reduced lung capacity. Chemotactic factors are essential to the immune responses against the virus infections, given their regulatory effect on dilations and positions of leukocytes in the host lungs. Therefore, spectral changes in chemotactic factors may lead to severely maladjusted immune responses. Immune insufficiency or misdirection may increase viral replication and cause tissue damages. In contrast, overactive immune responses may induce immunopathological conditions. In this review article, we provide an analysis of the role of cytokines secreted upon CoV infections and their potentially detrimental contribution to the damages of the respiratory tract and other tissues.2 INNATE IMMUNE RESPONSE\n2.1 Pathogen\u2010recognition receptors\nThe host innate immune system detects viral infections by using pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) to recognize pathogen\u2010associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). At present, the known PRRs mainly include toll\u2010like receptor (TLR), RIG\u2010I\u2010like receptor (RLR), NOD\u2010like receptor (NLR), C\u2010type lectin\u2010like receptors (CLmin), and free\u2010molecule receptors in the cytoplasm, such as cGAS, IFI16, STING, DAI, and so on.\n2.2 Toll\u2010like receptors\nPAMPs recognized by Toll\u2010like receptors (TLRs) include lipids, lipoproteins, proteins, and nucleic acids of the bacterial, viral, parasite, and fungal origins.6 The recognition of PAMPs by TLRs also occurs in cell membranes, endosomes, lysosomes, and endocytolysosomes and other locations in cells.6 Different TLRs can induce different biological responses via subsequent activation of varied adapter proteins, such as MyD88, TIRAP, TRIP, and TRAM, but these adapter proteins all share the Toll/Interleukin\u20101 receptor (TIR) structure.7 MyD88 is the first identified TIR family member, which acts as an adapter protein by almost all TLRs except TLR3. It mainly activates the transcription factors NF\u2010kB and mitogen\u2010activated protein kinases (MAPKs) pathways to induce inflammatory factors' expression.6 Unlike MyD88, TRIF is an adapter protein of TLR3 and TLR4, which activates the transcription factors IRF3 and NF\u2010kB to induce the expression of type I interferon and immune\u2010inflammatory factors. The function of TRAM and TIRAP is to recruit TRIF molecules to the TLR4 receptor and MyD88 to the TLR2 and TLR4 receptors. Therefore, the TLR signaling pathways are classified as the MyD88\u2010dependent pathway, which functions to activate immune\u2010inflammatory factors, and the TRIF\u2010dependent pathway, which functions to activate the type I interferons and inflammatory factors.6 After a TLR is activated by the corresponding PAMP, MyD88 recruits the busy\u20101 receptor\u2010related kinases IRAK4, IRAKI, IRAK2, and IRAK\u2010M. IRAK4 plays an important role in activating NF\u2010kB and MAPKs downstream of MyD88. IRAK interacts with TRAF6, which causes its K\u201063 ubiquitination, and facilitates NEMO ubiquitination to activate NF\u2010kB. TRIF\u2010dependent pathways activate IRF3 and NF\u2010kB.8, 9 In addition to activating NF\u2010kB, TRIF\u2010dependent pathways, they also activate IRF3 and interferon\u2010\u03b2.10, 11\n2.3 RIG\u2010I\u2010like receptors\nRIG\u2010I\u2010like receptors (RLRs), including the H family members RIG\u2010I (DDX58), MDA5 (IFIH), and LGP2, primarily recognize nucleic acids of RNA viruses.12, 13 They have a DExD/H\u2010box RNA helicase structure and a C\u2010terminal termination structure (CTD), while RIG\u2010I and MDA5 have an N\u2010terminal caspase recruitment structure (CARD), to interact with the downstream adapter MAVS. The C\u2010terminal RNA helicase and CTD structure are considered to recognize RNA, and its conformational change requires ATP to make the CARD structure interact with MAVS.14\nRIG\u2010I is activated by a variety of RNA viruses' infections, including Influenza A virus (IAV), Newcastle disease virus (NDV), Sendai virus (SeV), and Vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), Measles virus (MV), and Hepatitis C virus (HCV).15, 16 The common features of the viral RNAs are short double\u2010stranded with a triphosphate structure, and complementary ends and/or poly\u2010U/UC\u2010rich structure. The viral nucleocapsid proteins containing triphosphine RNA at the 5\u2032\u2010end can be recognized by RIG\u2010I.17 The double\u2010stranded RNA with double\u2010basic acid at the 5\u2032\u2010end can be recognized by RIG\u2010I.18 When the viral 5\u2032\u2010terminal triphosphate end is recognized by the CTD structure, the ATP\u2010dependent conformational change brings the CTD structure to form a complex with the double\u2010stranded RNA, and the CARD structure is then released from its self\u2010inhibition and interacts with MAVS.19\nMDA5 recognizes RNAs of picornaviruses, including poliovirus (PV) and Encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV). MDAS\u2010recognized RNA is characterized by long double\u2010stranded RNA more than 1 kbp. Crystal structure analysis shows that the helicase and CTD structure of MDA5 are also surrounded by double\u2010stranded RNA, the same as RIG\u2010I. However, the CTD structure of MDA5 does not have a hat structure,20 and the hat structure is necessary to have a triphosphate RNA interaction at the 5\u2032\u2010end. The CTD structure of MDA5 directly interacts with the double\u2010stranded RNA, so that the 5\u2032\u2010end RNA can be freely released.21\n2.4 Nucleotide\u2010binding and oligomerization domain\u2010like receptors\nNucleotide\u2010binding and oligomerization domain (NOD)\u2010like receptors (NLRs) are a class of pattern recognition receptors,22 which recognize components of pathogens and contain a conserved NOD structure.23 NLR receptor family members are divided into three subclasses according to their functions. The first NLR subclass forms complexes with a variety of proteins and these complexes are defined as inflammasome that contains at least eight NLR proteins, including NLRP1, NLRP3, NLRP6, NLRC4, NLRC5W, and AY2.24-26 The second subclass is essential to reproduction and embryo regeneration.27 The third subclass is comprised of regulatory NLRs. These NLRs are positive or negative conditioned inflammatory signaling cascade pathways.\n2.5 C\u2010type lectin\u2010like receptor\nC\u2010type lectin\u2010like receptor (CLRs) are a large family of soluble, transmembrane pattern recognition receptors with more than 1000 members, which are widely expressed in myeloid cells. Due to its motif structure in the intracellular region with multiple signaling pathways, the CLR receptor has a wide range of functions, including cell adhesion, induction of endocytosis, phage, tissue repair, platelet activation, and natural immune responses. There are two main ways of CLR receptor activation in the cells. The first type is direct activation, such as macrophage\u2010induced Mincle and CLEC4E receptors, and Dectin\u20102 (CLEC6A) receptors. The second type is to activate the receptor by activating HAM\u2010like motifs in the intracellular tail of the receptor, such as Dectin\u20101 (CLEC7A) and DNGR\u20101 (CLEC9A).28, 29 Both mechanisms involve the recruitment of acidified spleen tyrosine kinases, which in turn promotes CARD9, B\u2010cell lymphoid tissue 10 (BcL10), and Maltl complex formation. At the same time, apoptosis\u2010related granule\u2010like proteins, including ASC, is acidified by SyK and JNK,30 and PKCS is also a key essential element in the pathway.31 The signaling pathways activate downstream molecules, including NF\u2010kB and MAPKs, and trigger a variety of cellular responses, including cell phagocytosis, maturation of DC cells, and chemotaxis of cells.31\n2.6 Cytoplasmic DNA receptor\nExogenous microbial DNAs are recognized by host DNA receptors. In addition to TLR9 in the TLR family, Cytoplasmic DNA receptor (CDR) can recognizes DNA CpG islands.32 More than 10 CDRs distributed in the cytoplasm have been identified, including AIM2\u2010like receptors (ALRs), DNA\u2010dependent activator of IFN\u2010regulatory factor (DAI), interference stimulator of interferon gene (STING), leucine\u2010rich repeat flightless\u2010interacting protein 1 (LRRFIP1), DExD/H\u2010box RNA helicase (DDX), Meiotic recombinant protein 11 Homolog A (MRE11), RNA polymerase III (Pol III), DNA dependent protein kinase (DNA\u2010PK), DNA repair\u2010related proteins Rad50, cyclic GMP\u2010AMP synthase (cGAS), and Sry\u2010related HMG box 2 (Sox2).4, 32, 33 DAI recognizes Z\u2010type DNA and B\u2010type DNA, which does not depend on sequence specificity, but on the length of DNA.34, 35 AIM2 is mainly involved in the recognition of double\u2010stranded DNA. Exogenous microbial DNAs are also recognized by host DNA receptors. IFI16 and cGAS are reported to be novel DNA receptors that mediate cytosolic DNA recognition and induce type I interferon.36\n2.7 Type I interferons\nWhen a virus invades the host, PRRs initially recognize the viral nucleic acid, collect the specific signal adapter protein, activate IRF3 and IRF7 before being translocated to the nucleus and promote the synthesis of type I interferons (IFNs). Type I IFNs subsequently activate the downstream JAK\u2010STAT signal pathway, promote the expression of IFN\u2010stimulated genes (ISGs).37, 38\nAs the host's major antiviral molecules, IFNs limit virus spread, and play an immunomodulatory role to promote macrophage phagocytosis of antigens, as well as NK cells restriction of infected target cells and T/B cells. Thus, blocking the production of IFNs has a direct effect on the survival of the virus in the host.39, 40 So far, PRRs are divided into three types according to their forms of existence41: the membrane type includes TLR2, TLR4, mannose receptor (MR), scavenger receptor (SR); the secretory type comprises mannose\u2010binding lectin (MBL) and C\u2010reactive protein (CRP); the cytoplasmic type consists of TLR3, TLR7/8, and NLRs. Among them, the IFN production\u2010related PRRs mainly include TLRs, RLRs, and NLRs. The signaling pathways induce downstream IFNs production.42 Upon infecting plasma\u2010like dendritic cells (pDCs), the viral nucleic acids are recognized by TLR7/TLR9 to induce the production of inflammatory cytokines and type I IFNs mediated by NF\u2010\u03baB and IRF7.43, 44 VSV infection induces miR\u2010146a expression in macrophages through the RIG\u2010I/NF\u2010\u03baB\u2010dependent pathway45 and the disorder of the JAK\u2010STAT signaling pathway directly affects the spread of virus.46\nAlthough SARS\u2010CoV and other coronaviruses are sensitive to IFN\u2010a/b, these viruses remain highly pathogenic. Reportedly, the N protein of SARS\u2010CoV acts as an antagonist of immune escape protein and host interferon response.47-49 It is reported that EV71 infection downregulates JAK1, p\u2010JAK1, and p\u2010TYK2, inhibits p\u2010STAT1/2, and blocks the JAK\u2010STAT signaling pathway mediated by type I IFNs, thereby hindering the function of IFNs and promoting EV71 replication and proliferation in host cells.50 Ebola virus (EBOV) promotes cytokine signal inhibitory factor\u20101 (SOCS1) and blocks the JAK\u2010STAT signal pathway by directly binding to phosphorylated JAK, resulting in the inhibition of JAK activation.51 In addition, influenza A virus can inhibit the IFN\u2010I downstream pathway by inducing the expression of SOCS3.52\n2.8 Dendritic cells\nDendritic cells (DCs) play a key role in innate immune and adaptive immune responses. As the strongest antigen\u2010presenting cells in the organism, they effectively stimulate the activation of T\u2010lymphocytes and B\u2010lymphocytes, thus combining innate and adaptive immunity. Immature DCs have strong migration ability, and mature DCs can effectively activate T cells in the central link of start\u2010up, regulation, and maintenance of immune responses. Thus, once the maturation process of DCs is blocked, it directly affects the initiation of subsequent adaptive immune responses.53-55 DC precursor cells differentiate into DCs by adding such inducers as GM\u2010CSF, IL\u20104, and TNF\u2010\u03b1.56 However, DC precursor cells cannot differentiate into DCs if transfected with HIV\u20101 Nef protein in the presence of the inducers, indicating that Nef blocks the differentiation of DC precursor cells into mature DCs. Both the core protein and NS3 protein of HCV inhibit the expression of CD1a, CD1b, and DC\u2010SIGN molecules on human peripheral blood mononuclear precursor cells (PBMCs), which play an important role in the development of peripheral blood mononuclear precursor cells to DCs.57 In addition, HIV\u20101 attenuates the major histocompatibility antigen I (MHC I) on the surface of DCs, thereby reducing the ability of DCs to present the viral antigens. HIV\u20101 infection enhances the expression of DC\u2010specific intercellular adhesion molecule\u20103\u2010grabbing nonintegrity (DC\u2010SIGN), thus inhibiting CC chemokine receptor 7 (CCR7) and MHC\u2010II, which are important receptors of DC homing.58, 59 These results indicate that virus infection interferes with the differentiation and function of DCs, hinders the subsequent adaptive immune response mediated by DCs, and makes the virus evade the adaptive immune response of the host successfully.\n2.9 Defensins\nDefensins are a family of endogenous antibiotic peptide molecules, which widely exist in human, animals, and plants, and are important for the host's innate defense system. Defensins have broad\u2010spectrum antimicrobial activities. In vitro inhibition experiments show that defensins have killing effects on bacteria, fungi, mycoplasma, chlamydia, spirochetes, tumor cells, and viruses.60, 61\nDefensins of human and rabbit neutrophils are mainly found in the eosinophilic granules of neutrophils. They are small molecular cationic polypeptides composed of 29 to 34 amino acid residues, with a relative molecular weight of 3500 to 4000 dolt and three intramolecular disulfide bonds. They are main components of the neutrophils independent of oxygen sterilization.62, 63 Human \u03b1\u2010defensin HNP\u20101 inactivates herpes simplex virus type I and type II (HSV\u20101 and HSV\u20102), cytomegalovirus (CMV), VSV, and IAV.64, 65 Purified defensins of guinea pigs, rabbits, and rats have weak anti\u2010HIV\u20101 activity.66, 67\nHowever, some studies showed that purified human neutrophil defensin (HNP1\u20103) and rabbit neutrophil defensins (RNP1\u20135) could neither inhibit nor kill SARS\u2010CoV.68, 693 ADAPTIVE IMMUNE RESPONSES\n3.1 Immune response of T cells\nMERS\u2010CoV and SARS\u2010CoV are \u03b2\u2010coronaviruses that can cause fatal lower respiratory tract infections and extrapulmonary manifestations.70-72 T cells, CD4+ T cells, and CD8+ T cells particularly play a significant antiviral role by balancing the combat against pathogens and the risk of developing autoimmunity or overwhelming inflammation.73 CD4+ T cells promote the production of virus\u2010specific antibodies by activating T\u2010dependent B cells. However, CD8+ T cells are cytotoxic and can kill viral infected cells. CD8+ T cells account for about 80% of total infiltrative inflammatory cells in the pulmonary interstitium in SARS\u2010CoV\u2010infected patients and play a vital role in clearing CoVs in infected cells and inducing immune injury.74 In addition, by comparing T\u2010cell\u2010deficient BALB/c mice (transduced by ad5\u2010hdp4) with controls and B\u2010cell\u2010deficient mice, some researchers determined that T cells could survive in the infected lungs and destroy the infected cells.75 It emphasizes the important role of T cells rather than B cells in the control of pathogenesis of MERS\u2010CoV infection. A cross\u2010reactive T cell response leads to a decrease in MERS\u2010CoV.76 However, CD4+ T cells are more susceptible to MERS\u2010CoV infection. The depletion of CD8+ T cells do not affect and delay viral replication at the time of infection with SARS\u2010CoV.77, 78 Depletion of CD4+ T cells is associated with reduced pulmonary recruitment of lymphocytes and neutralizing antibody and cytokine production, resulting in a strong immune\u2010mediated interstitial pneumonitis and delayed clearance of SARS\u2010CoV from lungs.79 Additionally, T helper cells produce proinflammatory cytokines via the NF\u2010kB signaling pathway.80 IL\u201017 cytokines recruit monocytes and neutrophils to the site of infection with inflammation and activate other downstream cytokine and chemokine cascades, such as IL\u20101, LL\u20106, IL\u20108, IL\u201021, TNF\u2010\u03b2, and MCP\u20101.81, 82\nOn the other hand, MERS\u2010CoV induces T cell apoptosis by activating the intrinsic and extrinsic apoptosis pathways. A novel BH3\u2010like region located in the C\u2010terminal cytosolic domain of SARS\u2010CoV protein mediates its binding to Bcl\u2010xL and induced T\u2010cell apoptosis.83 During the later stage of infection, depletion of T cells having antiviral effects may prolong the infection and promote viral survival.84\nThe reappearance of SARS\u2010CoV is still a noteworthy problem. SARS\u2010CoV\u2010specific T cells have been screened in SARS convalescent patients. All the detected memory T cell responses are directed at SARS\u2010CoV structural proteins. Two CD8+T cell responses to SARS\u2010CoV membrane (M) and Nucleocapsid (N) protein are characterized by measuring their HLA restriction and minimal T cell epitope regions. Further, these reactions are found to last up to 11 years after infection. Absence of cross\u2010reactivity of these CD8+T cell responses against the MERS\u2010CoV is also demonstrated.78\nResults of the current research show that the T cell response to S protein and other structural proteins (including the M and N proteins) is long\u2010lasting and persistent. This provides evidence for the design of the SARS vaccine composed of viral structural proteins, which can induce dominant, effective, and long\u2010term memory cell responses against the virus.\n3.2 Humoral immune responses\nB cell subsets with phenotypes characteristic of naive, non\u2010isotype\u2010switched, memory cells and antibody\u2010secreting cells accumulate in CoVs.85 The antigen stimulation of MERS\u2010CoV infection was clarified by using the specific 9\u2010mer peptide \u201cCYSSLILDY\u201d, which located at position 437 to 445 within the region of the S glycoprotein.85 The sequence has the highest B cell antigenicity plot and has the ability to form the greatest number of interactions with MHCI alleles in a computerized simulation.86 Reports show that humoral immunity is essential to control the persistent phase of CoV infection. More antibodies isolated from patients who have survived MERS\u2010CoV infection have been described, including MCA1, CDC\u2010C2, CSC\u2010C5, CDC\u2010A2, CDC\u2010A10, MERS\u2010GD27, and MERS\u2010GD33.87-89\nThe complement system plays a vital role in the host immune response to CoV infection. Primitively identified as a host\u2010sensitive and nonspecific complement to adaptive immune pathways, the complement system provides a way for the innate immune system to detect and respond to foreign antigens.90 Given its potential to damage the host tissues, the complement system is tightly controlled by inhibiting proteins in the serum. Virus encoded proteins help them evade the detection of the complement system, suggesting that complements are vital to the antiviral response. C3a and C5a have potent proinflammatory properties and can trigger inflammatory cell recruitment and neutrophil activation. C3a and C5a blockade acts as a treatment for acute lung injury, and anti\u2010C5a antibody shows to protect mice from infection with MERS\u2010CoV.91 SARA\u2010CoV infection activates the complement pathway and complement signaling contributes to disease.92\n3.3 Antibody responses to coronaviruses' infections\nThe antibody response in vivo is a dynamic and complex mixture of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), which work together to target different antigenic domains on the envelope glycoprotein of the virus. It is important to determine whether the antibodies are powerful in the adaptive immune responses to MERS\u2010CoV infection. Research from all over the world have described more than 20 kinds of monoclonal antibodies, most of which are human or humanized antibodies. The virus uses its spike proteins as an adhesion factor to facilitate host entry through a special receptor called dipeptidyl peptidase\u20104 (DPP4). This receptor is considered a key factor in the signal transmission and activation of acquired and innate immune responses in infected patients. Thus, compared with the time\u2010consuming vaccine preparation, the design of monoclonal antibodies against these proteins has a better protective effect.\nHuman monoclonal antibody (m336) isolated from the phage display library interacts with the receptor\u2010binding region of MES coronavirus spike protein and displays strong neutralization activity to MES\u2010CoV in vitro.93 Human monoclonal antibody m336 shows high neutralization activity to MERS\u2010CoV in vitro. m336 reduces the RNA titer of lung by 40\u2009000 to 90\u2009000 folds.94 After infection with MERS\u2010CoV, monkeys were treated with high\u2010titer hyperimmune plasma or monoclonal antibody m336. Both groups had relieved symptoms of clinical diseases, but the reduction of respiratory viral load was only found in the hyperimmune plasma group. Although both super immune plasma and m336 therapy show to mitigate the disease of the common marmoset, neither has the ability to prevent the disease completely.95 Yet, HMab m336 is found to significantly reduce the viral RNA titers and viral\u2010associated pathological changes in rabbit lung tissue.94 Mice inoculated with S nanoparticles produced high\u2010level neutralizing antibodies against homologous viruses, and these antibodies have no cross\u2010protection with heteroviruses.96 After being stimulated by SARS\u2010CoV, immunized ferrets produced more rapid and stronger neutralizing antibody reaction than the control animals; however, the strong inflammatory reaction is observed in liver tissue. All this suggests that the expression of SARS\u2010CoV S protein is associated with enhanced hepatitis.97 On the other hand, the time course of SARS\u2010CoV viremia and antibody response has been studied.98 SARS\u2010CoV viremia is not detected in the blood samples of convalescent patients. In the peak period of viremia, 75% of the blood samples of patients diagnosed as SARS in the first 1 to 2 weeks before detection can detect virus RNA. The prolongation of IgG production may indicate the significance of IgG in both humoral immune response to acute SARS\u2010CoV infection and clearance of the remaining virus sources during recovery. This is an important subject that needs further study.4 CONCLUSIONS\nSince the emergence of SARS\u2010CoV in 2002 and its spread throughout 32 countries and areas, the world has experienced the outbreak of MERS\u2010CoV and now, the 2019\u2010nCoV. All these viruses belong to the subfamily Coronavirinae in the family Coronaviridae. Since CoVs emerge periodically and unpredictably, spread rapidly, and induce serious infectious diseases, they become a continuous threat to human health. This is especially true when there are no approved vaccines or drugs for the treatment of CoV infections and there exists a range of animal reservoirs for CoVs and recombinant CoVs. In recent years, profound understandings of the innate immune response to viruses have been made. This type of immune response inhibits virus replication, promotes virus clearance, induces tissue repair, and triggers a prolonged adaptive immune response against the viruses. In most cases, pulmonary and systemic inflammatory responses associated with CoVs are triggered by the innate immune system when it recognizes the viruses. Although a broadly protective, universal vaccine is considered the ultimate protection against the virus spread, vaccine development can be time\u2010consuming. To fulfill the pressing need, we should propose effective therapeutic measures using the accumulated knowledge of the innate immune response system. Targeted immunotherapy is a good alternative to some antivirals that have narrow treatment windows and meet with drug resistance easily. In 2003, glucocorticoid was widely used in SARS treatment to control pulmonary infection by regulating inflammatory responses. Except for viral pathogenicity, the inflammatory response of the body also plays a crucial role in SARS\u2010induced lung injury cases. Therefore, in CoV pneumonia cases, it is important to control cytokine production and inflammatory response, given that they are responsible for the accumulation of cells and fluids. This strategy is challenging as we have not yet clearly identified any features in an immune response that can be inhibited specifically without compromising the beneficial host defense.\nHowever, accomplishing this is not impossible. Notable achievements have been made in analyzing detrimental and protective mechanisms. For instance, completely blocking a proximal event in the immune response (eg, activation of IFN response\u2010related PRRs) seems unwise considering its general role in regulating the host defense. In contrast, more limited and specific effector arms, such as controlled production of oxygen radicals, NET formation, IL\u20101, IL\u20104, IL\u20106, IL\u20108, and IL\u201021 production, are probably practicable targets. At last, further research is needed to improve the understanding of the temporal features of CoV\u2010induced inflammatory response in relation to the timing of therapeutic interventions.ACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThis work was supported by research grants from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (81902066, 81730061, and 81471942).CONFLICT OF INTERESTS\nThe authors declare that there are no conflict of interests.", "25682": "1 INTRODUCTION\nChina has been the epicenter of emerging and re\u2010emerging viral infections that continue to stir a global concern. In the last 20 years, China has witnessed several emerging viral diseases, including an avian influenza in 1997,1 the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003,2 and a severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS) in 2010.3 The most recent crisis was the outbreak of an ongoing viral pneumonia with unknown etiology in the city of Wuhan, China. On 12 December 2019, Wuhan Municipal Health Commission (WMHC) reported 27 cases of viral pneumonia with 7 of them being critically ill. Most of them had a history of exposure to the virus at the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market where poultry, bats, snakes; and other wildlife animals were also sold.4 On 3 January 2020, WMHC updated the number of cases to a total of 44 with 11 of them in critical condition. On 5 January, the number of cases increased to 59 with 7 critically ill patients. The viral pneumonia outbreak was not caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS\u2010CoV), Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS\u2010CoV), influenza virus, or adenovirus as determined by laboratory tests.4 On 10 January, it was reported that a novel coronavirus designated 2019\u2010nCoV by the World Health Organization (WHO)5 was identified by high\u2010throughput sequencing of the viral RNA genome, which was released through virological.org. More significantly, the newly identified 2019\u2010CoV has also been isolated from one patient. The availability of viral RNA sequence has made it possible to develop reverse\u2010transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT\u2010PCR) methods for the detection of viral RNA in samples from patients and potential hosts.6 As a result, 217 patients were confirmed to be infected with the 2019\u2010nCoV, and 9 patients died as of 20 January 2020. Several patients from Wuhan were also reported in Thailand, Singapore, Hong Kong, South Korea, and Japan. High\u2010throughput sequencing of viral RNA from patients\u2019 samples has identified a novel coronavirus designated 2019\u2010nCoV by the World Health Organization. Currently, a total of 14 full\u2010length sequences of the 2019\u2010nCoV were released to GISAID and GeneBank.\nThe coronavirinae family consists of four genera based on their genetic properties, including genus Alphacoronavirus, genus Betacoronavirus, genus Gammacoronavirus, and genus Deltacoronavirus.7 The coronavirus RNA genome (ranging from 26 to 32\u2009kb) is the largest among all RNA viruses.8 Coronavirus can infect humans and many different animal species, including swine, cattle, horses, camels, cats, dogs, rodents, birds, bats, rabbits, ferrets, mink, snake, and other wildlife animals.7, 9 Many coronavirus infections are subclinical.7, 9 SARS\u2010CoV and MERS\u2010CoV belong to the Betacoronavirus genus and are zoonotic pathogens that can cause severe respiratory diseases in humans.7\nThe outbreak of viral pneumonia in Wuhan is associated with history of exposure to virus reservoir at the Huanan seafood wholesale market, suggesting a possible zoonosis. The seafood market also sold live animals such as snakes, marmots, birds, frogs, and hedgehogs. Currently, there is no evidence suggesting a specific wildlife host as a virus reservoir. Studies of relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU) bias between viruses and their hosts suggested that viruses tends to evolve codon usage bias that is comparable to their hosts.10, 11 Results from our analysis suggest that 2019\u2010nCoV has most similar genetic information with bat coronovirus and has most similar codon usage bias with snake. More interestingly, an origin\u2010unknown homologous recombination may occured within the spike glycoprotein of the 2019\u2010nCoV,5 which may explain its cross\u2010species transmission, and limited person\u2010person spread.2 MATERIALS AND METHODS\n2.1 Sequence data collection\nThe newly sequenced Beta\u2010coronavirus (MN908947) genome was downloaded from the GenBank database. Five hundred closely related sequences were also downloaded from GenBank. Out of them, 271 genome sequences (>19\u2009000\u2009bp in length) were used in this study together with the above\u2010described Beta\u2010coronavirus (2019\u2010nCoV, MN908947) genome sequence (Table S1). The geographic origins of the sequences were from Bulgaria (n\u2009=\u20091), Canada (n\u2009=\u20092), China (n\u2009=\u200967), Germany (n\u2009=\u20091), Hong Kong (n\u2009=\u20095), Italy (n\u2009=\u20091), Kenya (n\u2009=\u20091), Russia (n\u2009=\u20091), Singapore (n\u2009=\u200924), South Korea (n\u2009=\u20091), Taiwan (n\u2009=\u200911), United Kingdom (n\u2009=\u20092), United States of America (n\u2009=\u200967), and unknown (n\u2009=\u200988). Sequences were aligned using MAFFT v7.222,12 followed by manual adjustment using BioEdit v7.2.5.13\n2.2 Phylogenetic and simplot analysis\nPhylogenetic trees were constructed using maximum\u2010likelihood methods and general time\u2010reversible model of nucleotide substitution with gamma\u2010distributed rates among sites (GTR+G substitution model) in RAxML v8.0.9.14 Support for the inferred relationships was evaluated by a bootstrap analysis with 1000 replicates and trees were midpoint\u2010rooted.\nTo investigate the putative parents of the 2019\u2010nCoV, we performed Similarity and Bootscanning plot analyses based on the Kimura two\u2010parameter model with a window size of 500\u2009bp, step size of 30\u2009bp using SimPlot v.3.5.1.15 We divided our data set into four clades, the newly discovered 2019\u2010nCoV sequence was grouped as the query sequence. The closest relative coronaviruses (bat\u2010SL\u2010CoVZC45 and bat\u2010SL\u2010CoVZXC21) obtained from the city of Nanjing, China were grouped as \u201cClade A.\u201d The other two coronaviruses (BtCoV/BM48\u201031/BGR/2008 and BtKY72) from Bulgaria and Kenya were grouped as \u201cClade B.\u201d The rest sequences were grouped as \u201cClade C\u201d (Figure 1).\nFigure 1\nOpen in figure viewerPowerPoint\nMaximum likelihood phylogenetic tree of the 2019\u2010nCoV. Phylogenetic tree inferred from 272 near\u2010complete genome sequences of coronavirus was midpoint rooted and grouped into 4 clades (2019\u2010nCoV, Clades A, B, and C). Coronaviruses originating from different countries/regions are highlighted in colors\n2.3 Synonymous codon usage analysis\nTo estimate the RSCU bias of the 2019\u2010nCoV and its potential host(s), All avaliable coding sequences (retaining coding sequences with ATG primer and mutiple of 3 nucleotides, excluding incorrect coding sequences) of the 2019\u2010nCoV genome (1CDS's, 9672 codons), bat\u2010SL\u2010CoVZC45 genome (1CDS's, 9680 codons), Bungarus multicinctus genes (38 CDS's, 5381 codons), Naja atra genes (64 CDS's, 9587 codons), Erinaceus europaeus genome CDS (28947 CDS's, 16717458 codons), Marmota genes (36055CDS's, 21090600 codons), Manis javanica genome CDS (39192 CDS's, 22980491 codons), Rhinolophus sinicus genes (10 CDS's, 8081 codons) and Gallus gallus genome CDS (49453 CDS's, 36086657 codons) from GenBank were calculated with Codon W1.4.2.16, 17 The RSCU of human genes (40662582 codons) was retrieved from the Codon Usage Database (http://www.kazusa.or.jp/codon/). The relationship among these sequences was calculated using a squared Euclidean distance , as we previously reported.18 A heat map of RSCU was drawn with MeV 4.9.0 software.19 The coronavirus and their potential hosts were clustered using a Euclidean distance method.3 RESULTS\n3.1 Phylogenetic classification\nPhylogenetic analysis of 276 coronavirus genomes revealed that the newly identified coronavirus 2019\u2010nCoV sequence was monophyletic with 100% bootstrap support. The Clade A (bat\u2010SL\u2010CoVZC45 and bat\u2010SL\u2010CoVZXC21) derived from bats in the city of Nanjing, China between 2015 and 2017 represents the sister lineage to 2019\u2010nCoV. The Clade B (BtCoV/BM48\u201031/BGR/2008 and BtKY72) obtained from bats in Bulgaria and Kenya between 2005 and 2007 formed a distinct monophyletic cluster with 100% bootstrap support. The Clade C including 267 coronavirus strains was clustered together with 63% bootstrap support (Figure 1). This suggest that 2019\u2010nCoV has most similar genetic information with bat coronovirus.\n3.2 Homologous recombination may occured within the viral spike glycoprotein\nHomologous recombination is an important evolutionary force and previous studies have found that homologous recombination occurred in many viruses, including Dengue virus,20 human immunodeficiency virus,21 hepatitis B virus,22 hepatitis C virus,23 and classical swine fever virus.18 Similarity plot analysis of the 2019\u2010nCoV revealed that homologous recombination may occurred between Clade A strains (bat\u2010coronaviruses) and the origin\u2010unknown isolates, located within the spike glycoprotein that recognizes cell surface receptor (Figure 2). These characteristics indicate that cross\u2010species transmission may be caused by homologous recombination.\nFigure 2\nOpen in figure viewerPowerPoint\nSequence comparison among different coronaviruses. Similarity plot analysis was performed among coronaviruses in Clades A, B, and C. Recombination analysis was conducted with a sliding window of 500\u2009bp and a step size of 30\u2009bp. Recombination sites were located within the viral spike glycoprotein genes, as indicated by an orange box on the top\n3.3 Relative synonymous codon usage analysis\nAs parasitic microorganism, virus codon usage pattern resembles its host to some extent. The RSCU bias shows that the 2019\u2010nCoV, bat\u2010SL\u2010CoVZC45, and snakes from China have similar synonymous codon usage bias (Figure 3A, Table 1). The squared euclidean distance indicates that the 2019\u2010nCoV and snakes from China have the highest similarity in synonymous codon usage bias compared to those of bat, bird, Marmota, human, Manis, and hedgehog and (Figure 3B). Two types of snakes, containing B. multicinctus (many\u2010banded krait) and N. atra (Chinese cobra) were used for RSCU analysis. Squared Euclidean distance between the 2019\u2010nCoV and B. multicinctus is 13.54. The distance between the 2019\u2010nCoV and another snake N. atra is 16.69. The distance between the 2019\u2010nCoV and Rhinolophus sinicus is 23.46. However, the distance between the 2019\u2010nCoV and other animals is greater than 26, specifically 26.93 for bird, 34.79 for Marmota, 35.36 for human, 36.71 for Manis, and 37.96 for hedgehog. These data suggest that the 2019\u2010nCoV might more effectively use snake's translation machinery than that of other animals.\nFigure 3\nOpen in figure viewerPowerPoint\nComparison of relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU) between 2019\u2010nCoV and its putative wildlife animal reservoir(s).

Green color represents additional geographic distribution of Bungarus multicinctus. The location of Wuhan city where the 2019\u2010nCoV outbreak occurs is indicated in red. Maps were obtained from Craft MAP website (http://www.craftmap.box\u2010i.net/)4 DISCUSSION\nIn this study, we have performed an evolutionary analysis using 272 genomic sequences of coronaviruses obtained from various geographic locations. Our results show that the novel coronavirus sequence obtained from the viral pneumonia outbreak occurring in the city of Wuhan forms a separate group that is highly distinctive to SARS\u2010CoV. The SARS\u2010CoV first emerged in China in 2002 and then spread to 37 countries/regions in 2003 and caused a travel\u2010related global outbreak with 9.6% mortality rate.26 More importantly, results from our analysis reveal a homologous recombination may occurred between the bat coronavirus and an origin\u2010unknown coronavirus within the viral spike glycoprotein gene. Sequence homology analysis of the partial spike glycoprotein genes (1\u2010783\u2009bp) from the 2019\u2010nCoV was done through BLAST at the NCBI website. Interestingly, no similar sequence was found with known sequence in the database, suggesting that a putative recombination parent virus was still unknown. Previous study suggested that the recombination of SARS in the spike glycoprotein genes might have mediated the initial cross\u2010species transmission event from bats to other mammals.27 Bootscanning plot analysis (data not shown) suggested that the major parents of the 2019\u2010nCoV originated from Clade A (bat\u2010SL\u2010CoVZC45 and bat\u2010SL\u2010CoVZXC21) but formed a monophyletic cluster different from them. Overall, the ancestral origin of the 2019\u2010nCoV was more likely from divergent host species rather than SARS\u2010CoV.\nThe host range of some animal coronaviruses was promiscuous.7 They caught our attention only when they caused human diseases such as SARS, MERS, and 2019\u2010nCoV pneumonia.4, 9, 28 It is critical to determine the animal reservoir of the 2019\u2010nCoV to understand the molecular mechanism of its cross\u2010species spread. Homologous recombination within viral structural proteins between coronaviruses from different hosts may be responsible for \u201ccross\u2010species\u201d transmission.27 Information obtained from RSCU analysis provides some insights to the question of wildlife animal reservoir although it requires further validation by experimental studies in animal models. Currently, the 2019\u2010nCoV has not been isolated from animal species although it was obtained from one patient. Identifying and characterizing the animal reservoir for 2019\u2010nCoV will be helpful for investigation of the recombination and for a better understanding of its person\u2010to\u2010person spread among human populations.\nThe 2019\u2010nCoV has caused a total of 217 confirmed cases of pneumonia in China as of 20 January 2020 with new patients also reported in Hong Kong, Thailand, Singapore, South Korea, and Japan. Unlike SARS\u2010CoV, the 2019\u2010nCoV appeared to initially cause a mild form of viral pneumonia and have limited capability for person\u2010person spread. This might be due to the recombination occurred within the receptor\u2010binding glycoprotein. However, there is a concern about its adaptation in humans that may acquire the capability to replicate more efficiently and spread more rapidly via close person\u2010person contact.\nIn summary, results derived from our evolutionary analysis suggest that 2019\u2010nCoV has most similar genetic information with bat coronovirus and has most similar codon usage bias with snake. Additionally, a homologous recombination may occured within the viral receptor\u2010binding spike glycoprotein, which may determine cross\u2010species transmission. These novel findings warrant future investigation to experimentally determine if homologous recombination within the spike glycoprotein determine the tropism of the 2019\u2010nCoV in viral transmission and replication. New information obtained from our evolutionary analysis is highly significant for effective control of the outbreak caused by the 2019\u2010nCoV\u2010induced pneumonia.ACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThis study was supported by Project of Guangxi Health Committee (No. Z20191111) and Natural Science Foundation of Guangxi Province of China (No. 2017GXNSFAA198080) to Dr Xiaofang Zhao.

Data collection: JZ, WW, and XZ. Data analysis: WJ and XL.", "25518": "1 INTRODUCTION\nBone marrow stromal antigen 2 (BST2, also designated as CD317 or tetherin) is a type II integral membrane protein containing a cytoplasmic N\u2010terminal region followed by a spanning transmembrane domain and a carboxy\u2010terminal glycosyl\u2010phosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor.1 BST2 is an interferon\u2010inducible gene that functions as an innate defense system against virus infections. It has been described as a host restriction factor capable of impeding the release of several types of enveloped viruses, including retroviruses,2-7 filoviruses,8-10 arenaviruses,11 influenza,12 and the Sendai virus.13\nOne research team has proposed that BST2 inhibits virus release by tethering nascent virions to cell surfaces via the N\u2010terminal transmembrane domain and C\u2010terminal GPI anchor.14 Most BST2\u2010restricted enveloped viruses bud directly from cell surfaces, but a small number of enveloped viruses (eg, herpesviruses) are subject to BST2\u2010related restrictions even though their final envelopment entails membranes from TGN and/or endosomal compartments and egression via exocytosis.15, 16 In a previous study we reported that the human coronavirus 229E (HCoV\u2010229E), whose assembly and budding occurs at the ER\u2010Golgi intermediate compartment and whose virions are released via vesicle exocytosis,17-19 is also subject to BST2 inhibition. Results from electron microscopy analyses indicate the presence of HCoV\u2010229E virions on cell surfaces or on the membranes of intracellular vesicles that tend to cluster with BST2. This suggests the BST2\u2010triggered tethering of budding virions to vesicle membranes that remain on cell surfaces at the plasma membrane after exocytosis.17 BST2 has been described as moderately restricting the release of the hepatitis C virus, whose assembly takes place in the ER and whose release from cells via secretory pathways occurs in a manner similar to that of coronaviruses.20, 21 Combined, these data support the assumption that enveloped virus budding and release occurring at the plasma membrane or in an intracellular compartment is subject to BST2 blocking. BST2 is a component of innate immune response in the form of restricted enveloped virion release, and many viruses have evolved specific antagonists to counteract BST2 antiviral activity: HIV\u20101 Vpu, HIV\u20102 Env, simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) Nef and Env, Ebola and Sendai virus GP, Kaposi's sarcoma\u2010associated herpesvirus K5, and influenza virus neuraminidase are all capable of antagonizing BST2.2-5, 9, 12, 13, 15, 22 Since some of these anti\u2010BST2 viral factors are viral envelope glycoproteins, there is speculation that SARS\u2010CoV spike glycoprotein may possess the property to counteract the BST2 blocking of virus release. Our work is built in part on an earlier finding by another research team that the ORF7a accessory protein (encoded by SARS\u2010CoV) inhibits the BST2 tethering of virions.23 We also found that the SARS\u2010CoV spike (S) protein is capable of downmodulating BST2, thus mitigating the BST2\u2010mediated restriction of virus\u2010like particle (VLP) release, and suggesting that SARS\u2010CoV and other enveloped viruses are capable of evolving additional anti\u2010BST2 factors.2 MATERIALS AND METHODS\n2.1 Plasmid construction and expression vectors\nMammalian expression vectors encoding SARS\u2010CoV M, N, S, and E were provided by G. J. Nabel.24 BST2 dimerization\u2010defective mutant (BST2/C3A) was a gift from Klaus Strebel.25 Plasmid pTRE\u2010HN, kindly provided by Volker Thiel,26 served as a template to generate PCR product containing HCoV\u2010229E nucldocapsid coding sequence, using a forward primer 5\u2032\u2010CGCAATCGATTCATGAAGGCAGTTGCT\u20103\u2032 and a reverse primer 5\u2032\u2010CTTCGGATCCCGTTTACTTCATCAAT\u20103. For constructing an HA\u2010tagged HCoV\u2010229E M expression vector, a plasmid containing codon optimized sequence (synthesized by Mission Biotech, Taiwan) served as a template, using a forward primer 5\u2032\u2010CGCAATCGATTCATGAAGGCAGTTGCT\u20103\u2032 (forward) and a reverse primer 5\u2032\u2010CTTCGGATCCCGTTTACTTCATCAAT\u20103. PCR\u2010amplified products were digested with BamHI and ClaI and cloned into the SARS\u2010CoV M or N expression backbone, yielding HCoV\u2010229N or HA\u2010tagged 229M expression vectors.\n2.2 Virus, cell culture, and transfection\n293T, HeLa, and stable BST2\u2010knockdown HeLa cell lines (HeLa/BST2\u2010)17 were maintained in Dulbecco modified Eagle medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Invitrogen). Confluent cells were trypsinized and seeded onto 10\u2009cm dish plates 24\u2009hours before transfection. For each construct, cells were transfected with 20\u2009\u03bcg of plasmid DNA by the calcium phosphate precipitation method; 50\u2009\u03bcm chloroquine was added to enhance transfection efficiency. Unless otherwise indicated, 10\u2009\u03bcg of each plasmid was used for cotransfection. For HeLa transfection, plasmid DNA was mixed with GenCarrier (Epoch Biolabs) at a ratio of 1\u2009\u03bcg to 1\u2009\u03bcL; the transfection procedure was performed according to the manufacturer's protocols. Human coronavirus 229E (HCoV\u2010229E) were propagated in HeLa or A549 cells as described previously.17\n2.3 Protein analysis\nCulture supernatant from transfected cells was collected, filtered, and centrifuged through 2\u2009mL of 20% sucrose in TSE (10\u2009mM Tris\u2013HCl [pH 7.5], 100\u2009mM NaCl, 1\u2009mM EDTA plus 0.1\u2009mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride [PMSF]) at 4\u00b0C for 40\u2009minutes at 274\u2009000g. Pellets were suspended in IPB (20\u2009mM Tris\u2013HCl [pH 7.5], 150\u2009mM NaCl, 1\u2009mM EDTA, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1% Triton X\u2010100, 0.02% sodium azide) plus 0.1\u2009mM PMSF. Cells were rinsed with ice\u2010cold phosphate\u2010buffered saline (PBS), collected in IPB plus 0.1\u2009mM PMSF, and microcentrifuged at 4\u00b0C for 15\u2009minutes at 13\u2009700g to remove unbroken cells and debris. Either supernatant or cell samples were mixed with equal volumes of 2\u00d7 sample buffer (12.5\u2009mM Tris\u2013HCl [pH 6.8], 2% SDS, 20% glycerol, 0.25% bromphenol blue) and 5% \u03b2\u2010mercaptoethanol and boiled for 5\u2009minutes or (for the M\u2010containing samples) incubated at 45\u00b0C for 10\u2009minutes. Samples were resolved by electrophoresis on SDS\u2010polyacrylamide gels and electroblotted onto nitrocellulose membranes. Membrane\u2010bound M or HA\u2010M proteins were immunodetected using a SARS\u2010CoV M rabbit antiserum or anti\u2010HA (LTK BioLaboratories, Taiwan) monoclonal antibody. For SARS\u2010CoV N or S detection, a mouse monoclonal antibody was used.27, 28 BST2 was probed with a human BST2 mouse antiserum (ab88523, Abcam) or a rabbit antiserum.29 Vpu was detected with a rabbit antiserum.30 The secondary antibody was a sheep antimouse or donkey antirabbit horseradish peroxidase\u2010(HRP) conjugated antibody (Invitrogen).\n2.4 Laser scanning immunofluresecne microscopy\nHeLa cells were split 1:80 onto coverslips 24\u2009hours before transfection. Between 18 and 24\u2009hours posttransfection, cells were washed with PBS and either directly probed with an anti\u2010BST2 antibody before cell membrane permeabilization. Cells then were permeablized in in acetone for 10\u2009minutes at room temperature after fixation with 3.7% formaldehyde at 4\u00b0C for 20\u2009minutes. Samples were incubated with the primary antibody for 1\u2009hour and with the secondary antibody for 30\u2009minutes. After each incubation, samples were subjected to three washes (5 to 10\u2009minutes each) with DMEM/calf serum. BST2 was probed with a rabbit antiserum.29 SARS\u2010CoV S was detected with a mouse monoclonal antibody.27 A rhodamine\u2010conjugated or FITC\u2010conjugated antirabbit or antimouse antibody served as the secondary antibody (Cappel, ICN Pharmaceuticals, Aurora, OH). After a final DMEM/calf serum wash, the coverslips were washed three times with PBS and mounted in 50% glycerol in PBS for viewing. Images were analyzed and photographs taken using the inverted laser Zeiss.3 RESULTS\n3.1 BST2 restricts coronavirus VLP release\nIn our previous report, we determined that the coexpression of either SARS\u2010CoV28 or HCoV\u2010229E M and N (unreported results) are sufficient for VLP production. To test the ability of BST2 to inhibit coronavirus VLP release, M, and N proteins from SARS\u2010CoV or HC0V\u2010229E were coexpressed with or without BST2 in 293T cells; NL4.3delVpu (a Vpu\u2010deficient HIV\u20101 virion\u2010producing expression vector) served as a control. Since SARS\u2010CoV M can be released into the medium as vesicles31 but N cannot be released without M coexpression,32 N detected in medium indicates VLPs formed by M and N. Accordingly, VLP release levels can be measured as N detected in medium. Data from repeat independent experiments indicate that BST2 coexpression led to significant decreases in SARS\u2010CoV, HCoV\u2010229E, and HIV\u20101delVpu VLP yields ( Figures 1A\u2010D). The BST2 inhibitory effect on VLP release occurred dose\u2010dependently (Figures 1E\u2010G).\nFigure 1\nOpen in figure viewerPowerPoint\nBST2 inhibits coronavirus virus\u2010like particle (VLP) production. A\u2010D, 293T cells were cotransfected with SARS M and N (panel A), HA\u2010tagged HCoV\u2010229E M and N (panel B), or NL4.3delVpu (panel C) expression vectors, with (lane 2) or without a BST2 expression vector. Cells and supernatants were harvested and subjected to Western immunoblotting at 24 to 36\u2009hours posttransfection. D, N proteins from medium or cell samples were quantified by scanning N band densities from immunoblots. Rations of N level in media to those in cells were determined for each sample and normalized to that of samples without BST2 coexpression. Data were derived from at least three independent experiments. *P\u2009<\u2009.05; **P\u2009<\u2009.01. (E\u2010G) 293T cells were transfected with SARS (panel E), HCoV\u2010229E (panel F), or HIV\u20101 (panel G) VLP\u2010producing expression vectors as described for (A\u2010C). All tests were performed with 0.1\u2009\u03bcg, 0.5\u2009\u03bcg, or 2\u2009\u03bcg of cotransfected BST2 expression plasmids (lanes 2, 3 and 4, respectively). H\u2010J, HeLa or BST2\u2010knockdown HeLa (HeLa/BST2\u2010) cells were transfected with the indicated SARS, HCoV\u2010229E, or HIV\u20101 VLP\u2010producing plasmid. Cells and supernatants were harvested, prepared and subjected to Western immunoblotting at 48 to 72\u2009hours posttransfection. Viral proteins were detected with anti\u2010SARS\u2010CoV M, anti\u2010HCoV\u2010229 N antiserum, or monoclonal antibodies against SARS\u2010CoV N, HA\u2010tagged HCoV\u2010229 M, or p24CA. BST2 was probed with a rabbit anti\u2010BST2 antibody. BST2, bone marrow stromal antigen 2; SARS\u2010CoV, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus\nWe also used HeLa cells (which constitutively express BST2) to assess the impact of endogenous BST2 on VLP yields and found that BST2\u2010knockdown HeLa cells (HeLa/BST2\u2010) produced VLPs at higher levels compared to normal HeLa cells (Figures 1H\u2010J). This suggests that VLP release is also subject to restrictions associated with endogenous BST2. To determine whether reduced VLP yield is a result of VLPs being tethered to cell membranes by BST2, cells were treated with subtilisin, a nonspecific protease capable of triggering cell surface\u2010associated virion release via BST2 cleavage.17, 33 Our results indicate increased medium\u2010associated VLP quantities following subtilisin treatment (Figures 2A\u2010C, lane 6 vs. lane 4), confirming that BST2 trapped VLPs on cell surfaces. Combined, the data suggest that both exogenous and endogenous BST2 are capable of inhibiting SARS\u2010CoV and HCoV\u2010229E VLP release.\nFigure 2\nOpen in figure viewerPowerPoint\nSubtilisin treatment promotes virus\u2010like particle release. 293T cells were cotransfected with SARS CoV (A), HCoV\u2010229E M and N (B), or NL4.3delVpu (C) with or without a BST2 expression vector. Cells were split equally into two dish plates at 24\u2009hours posttransfection. After an additional 4\u2009hours, culture medium was removed, washed twice with PBS, and incubated with PBS containing subtilisin (1\u2009mg/mL) for 10\u2009minutes at 37\u2103. Supernatants were harvested and centrifuged through 20% sucrose cushions, and pellets and cell lysates were subjected to western immunoblotting. Viral proteins were probed as described in the Figure 1 caption.

Blocking BST2 dimerization by replacing cysteines C53, C63, and C91 with alanine in the BST2 ectodomain, in turn, blocks the BST2 inhibition of HIV\u20101 release, suggesting that such dimerization is required for virion release blocking.25 To test whether BST2 dimerization is also required for restricting coronavirus VLP release, M and N proteins were coexpressed with a dimerization\u2010defective BST2/C3A mutant containing alanine substitutions for C53, C63, and C91. Results indicate that wild\u2010type BST2 was capable of inhibiting SARS\u2010CoV, HCoV\u2010229E, and HIV\u20101 VLP production, but BST2/C3A was not (Figures 3A\u2010C, lane 2 vs. lane 3), further suggesting that BST2 dimerization is required to inhibit coronavirus VLP release.\nFigure 3\nOpen in figure viewerPowerPoint\nCysteine residues in the BST2 N\u2010terminal ectodomain are important for inhibiting VLP release. 293T cells were cotransfected with SARS M plus N (panel A), HA\u2010tagged HCoV\u2010229E M plus N (panel B), or NL4.3delVpu (panel C) plus a wild\u2010type or mutant BST2 expression vector (BST2/C3A) containing alanine substitutions for three cysteine residues in the BST2 ectodomain. Cells and supernatants were harvested and subjected to western immunoblotting at 24 to 36\u2009hours posttransfection. BST2, bone marrow stromal antigen 2; VLP, virus\u2010like particle\n3.3 SARS\u2010CoV spike (S) alleviates BST2 restriction of HIV\u20101 release by downregulating BST2\nAs stated above, several viral membrane glycoproteins such as HIV\u20102 and SIV Env, as well as Ebola and Sendai virus GP proteins, exert counteractive effects on BST2. We, therefore, attempted to identify anti\u2010BST2 activity associated with the SARS\u2010CoV spike (S) protein. Since BST2 is known to restrict HIV\u20101 release in the absence of Vpu, we performed tests to determine whether SARS\u2010CoV S counteracts BST2 and therefore supports HIV\u20101 release. As shown in the upper panel of Figure 4A (lane 2 vs. lanes 3 and 4), the inhibitory effect of BST2 on NL4.3delVpu virion release decreased in the presence of either SARS\u2010CoV S or Vpu in step with reduced BST2 expression (Figure 4A, middle panel, lanes 2\u20104), suggesting that SARS\u2010CoV S is capable of promoting the release of HIV\u20101 virus particles from cells via BST2 downregulation. Additional experiments confirmed that SARS\u2010CoV S, like Vpu, is capable of reducing BST2 expression in a dose\u2010dependent manner (Figures 4B and C). Combined, the data suggest that SARS\u2010CoV S may counteract the BST2\u2010mediated restriction of VLP release.\nFigure 4\nOpen in figure viewerPowerPoint\nSARS\u2010CoV S downregulates BST2. A, SARS\u2010CoV S reduced the inhibition of HIV\u20101 VLP production by BST2. 293T cells were transfected with NL4.3delVpu alone (lane 1) or combined with BST2 (lane 2) plus Vpu (lane 3) or SARS\u2010CoV S (lane 4) expression vectors. Cells and supernatants were harvested and subjected to western immunoblotting at 24 to 36\u2009hours posttransfection. B\u2010C, 293T cells were transfected with 100\u2009ng of BST2 alone (lane 1) or BST2 plus 1\u2009\u03bcg (lane 2) or 3\u2009\u03bcg (lane 3) of a SARS\u2010CoV S (panel B) or Vpu expression vector (panel C).

Transfectants were treated with either MG132 (a proteasome inhibitor)39 or ammonium chloride (NH4Cl, a lysosome inhibitor).40 We found that BST2 downregulation mediated by SARS\u2010CoV S was not significantly affected when the proteasome function was inhibited, but was noticeably reduced following lysosome function inhibition (Figure 5, lanes 5\u20107). Consistent with previous reports, we observed that proteasome or lysosome function inhibition resulted in markedly reduced Vpu\u2010mediated BST2 downregulation (Figure 5, lanes 2\u20104), suggesting that BST2 downregulation as mediated by SARS\u2010CoV S largely occurs via the lysosomal degradation pathway.\nFigure 5\nOpen in figure viewerPowerPoint\nSARS\u2010CoV S downregulates BST2 via a lysosomal degradation pathway. 293T cells were transfected with BST2 (lane 1) or cotransfected with BST2 plus a Vpu (lanes 2\u20104) or SARS\u2010CoV S (lanes 5\u20107) expression vector. At 24\u2009hours posttransfection, cells were either left untreated (lanes 1, 2, and 5), treated with 30\u2009\u03bcM MG\u2010132 for 6\u2009hours (lanes 3 and 6), or treated with 25\u2009\u03bcM NH4Cl (lanes 4 and 7) for 6\u2009hours before harvesting and immunoblotting. BST2, bone marrow stromal antigen 2; SARS\u2010CoV, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus\n3.5 SARS\u2010CoV spike glycoprotein colocalizes with BST2\nSince BST2 largely localizes at cell surfaces (where they tether virions to prevent their release), we tested whether SARS\u2010CoV S antagonizes BST2 via surface BST2 downregulation. 293 cells were cotransfected with BST2 and SARS\u2010CoV S expression vectors. We observed that BST2 and S colocalized in perinuclear areas, but BST2 signals were barely detectable on cell surfaces. Instead, BST2 largely localized in perinuclear areas regardless of whether or not it was coexpressed with S (Figure 6A). This is consistent with a previous report that unlike HeLa\u2010endogenous BST2 (which localizes on cell surfaces as well as in the perinuclear area), exogenous BST2 predominantly localizes in perinuclear areas, with little distribution on cell surfaces.41 Nevertheless, flow cytometry quantification suggests that BST2 cell surface expression is noticeably reduced in 293T cells following SARS\u2010CoV S coexpression (Figure 6C). In the case of HeLa cells (which constitutively express BST2), we did found SARS\u2010CoV S colocalized with BST2 in the plasma membrane (Figure 6B). BST2 green fluorescence intensity on HeLa cell surfaces decreased slightly following SARS\u2010CoV S coexpression, suggesting that the capacity of SARS\u2010CoV S to counteract the BST2\u2010associated inhibition of virion release was due in part to cell surface BST2 downmodulation.\nFigure 6\nOpen in figure viewerPowerPoint\nSARS\u2010CoV glycoprotein S colocalizes with BST2. 293 cells (panel A) were cotransfected with BST2 and a SRAS\u2010CoV expression vector. HeLa cells (panel B) were transfected with the SARS\u2010CoV S expression vector. At 24 to 36\u2009hours posttransfection, cells were probed with an anti\u2010BST2 antibody before cell membrane permeabilization. SARS\u2010CoV S was probed with an anti\u2010S polyclonal antiserum. A rhodamine\u2010conjugated or FITC\u2010conjugated antirabbit or antimouse antibody served as a secondary antibody. C, SARS\u2010CoV S coexpression reduces BST2 cell surface expression. 293T cells were transfected with BST2 alone (middle panel) or together with a SARS\u2010CoV S expression vector (bottom panel). At 24 to 36\u2009hours posttransfection, cells were fixed and probed with a rabbit anti\u2010BST2 antibody before the permeabilization of cell membranes, followed by a secondary FITC\u2010conjugated antirabbit antibody. Cells then were analyzed by flow cytometry. BST2, bone marrow stromal antigen 2; SARS\u2010CoV, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus4 DISCUSSION\nBST2 is capable of inhibiting SARS\u2010CoV and HCoV\u2010229E VLP release (Figure 1). Since the BST2 inhibition of HIV\u20101 release via virion tethering at cell surfaces is well documented, we used a Vpu\u2010deficient HIV\u20101 virus\u2010producing vector (NL4.3delVpu) as a control in our experiments. As shown in Figure 2, coronavirus VLPs (similar to those of HIV\u20101) were tethered to cell surfaces by BST2, and BST2 inhibited SARS\u2010CoV and HCoV\u2010229E VLP release in a BST2 dimerization\u2010dependent manner, similar to HIV\u20101 (Figure 3). Further, in the same manner, as Vpu, SARS\u2010CoV S facilitated HIV\u20101 release via BST2 downregulation (Figure 4). We determined that Vpu downmodulated BST2 via proteasomal and lysosomal degradation pathways and that the predominant lysosomal pathway was mediated by SARS\u2010CoV S (Figure 5). Our confocal microscopy observations suggest that SARS\u2010CoV S colocalized with BST2 at HeLa cell surfaces (Figure 6). SARS\u2010CoV S likely binds to BST2, after which it serves as a target for lysosomal degradation. Vpu is capable of trapping BST2 intracellularly and preventing its recycling back into the plasma membrane.29, 35, 37, 42, 43 Whether SARS\u2010CoV S similarly counteracts BST2 requires further investigation.\nThe transmembrane protein SARS\u2010CoV ORF7a has been shown to counteract BST2 tethering by interfering with BST2 glycosylation.23, 44 In addition to the likelihood that BST2\u2010associated restriction of SARS\u2010CoV virion release is mitigated by SARS\u2010CoV S, it is possible that a number of enveloped viruses have developed supplementary anti\u2010BST2 factors over time\u2014note that in addition to Vpu, HIV\u20101 Nef is capable of overcoming BST2 restrictions on virus release under certain conditions.45 SIV Nef7 and Env2 are capable of antagonizing BST2, and influenza neuraminidase12 and M246 proteins both possess anti\u2010BST2 capabilities. Some researchers have suggested that influenza and/or Ebola VLP release, but not virion release, is inhibited by BST2.11, 47 Due to biosafety requirements, we are currently unable to perform tests to determine whether SARS\u2010CoV S is capable of overcoming BST2 restrictions on SARS\u2010CoV virion release.ACKNOWLEDGMENT\nThe anti\u2010BST2 reagent (cat #11722) used in this study was obtained from the AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program, Division of AIDS, NIAID, NIH; we wish to thank Drs.

The host and viral population heterogeneity could influence clinical phenotypes. Employing long RT\u2010PCR with Illumina sequencing, we quantified the gene mutation load at 0.5% mutation frequency for the 4529 bp\u2010domain spanning the Spike gene (4086\u2009bp) of HCoV\u2010OC43 in four upper respiratory clinical specimens obtained during acute illness. There were a total of 121 mutations for all four HCoV samples with the average number of mutations at 30.3\u2009\u00b1\u200910.2, which is significantly higher than that expected from the Illumina sequencing error rate. There were two mutation peaks, one at the 5\u2032 end and the other near position 1\u2009550 in the S1 subunit. Two coronavirus samples were genotype B and two were genotype D, clustering with HCoV\u2010OC43 strain AY391777 in neighbor\u2010joining tree phylogenetic analysis. Nonsynonymous mutations were 76.1\u2009\u00b1\u200914% of mutation load. Although lower than other RNA viruses such as hepatitis C virus, HCoV\u2010OC43 did exhibit quasi\u2010species. The rate of nonsynonymous mutations was higher in the HCoV\u2010OC43 isolates than in hepatitis C (HCV) virus genotype 1a isolates analyzed for comparison in this study. These characteristics of HCoV\u2010OC43 may affect viral replication dynamics, receptor binding, antigenicity, evolution, transmission, and clinical illness.1 INTRODUCTION\nHuman coronavirus\u2010OC43 (HCoV\u2010OC43) is within the Betacoronavirus genus (family Coronaviridae) and is an enveloped, positive sense, single\u2010stranded RNA virus.1, 2 There are five known genotypes and other betacoronaviruses include severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) CoV.3 HCoV\u2010OC43 is prevalent among humans and genotype D has been prominent in recent years.3-5 Little is known about how HCoV\u2010OC43 genotypes persist in human populations, but continuous adaptation by viral antigenic genes in the Spike protein through genetic drift may be necessary. The Spike protein is the major antigenic protein and is under selection pressure by the host immune response; it is important for host range and tissue tropism. It is cleaved into S1 and S2 subunits for receptor binding and membrane fusion. The N\u2010terminal domain of the S1 subunit is responsible for sugar receptor binding and the S2 subunit is responsible for fusion of viral and host membranes.6 The S1 subunit is more divergent in sequence and the S2 subunit is more conserved.1-3, 7\nHuman coronaviruses cause the common cold and influenza\u2010like illnesses, but can be associated with more severe illnesses such as pneumonia, exacerbations of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, croup, and bronchiolitis. In patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease studied during the 1998\u20101999 influenza season, 13.5% of illnesses were associated with HCoV\u2010229E and HCoV\u2010OC43 infection, while in another study between 2009 and 2013, 19% of acute respiratory illnesses in patients with cardiopulmonary diseases and 21.5% in healthy young adults were associated with HCoV.8-11 Coronavirus\u2010associated illness was less severe than influenza but was associated with multiple respiratory and systemic symptoms, and hospitalization.10 HCoV\u2010229E and HCoV\u2010OC43 infection rates of 2.8\u201026% in healthy young and elderly adults, high\u2010risk adults, and hospitalized patients were reported during the winters of 1999\u20102003 and they contributed to medical disease burden.12\nLittle is known about the degree of heterogeneity of HCoV\u2010OC43 viral quasi\u2010species present in upper respiratory secretions. If present, this may help explain persistent incidence of HCoV\u2010OC43 infections in human populations, if the mutational changes result in antigenic drift. This might allow escape from host immunity and contribute to virus infectivity and pathogenicity.\nIn the current study, we combined RT\u2010PCR and Illumina sequencing to measure the diversity of HCoV\u2010OC43 Spike gene quasi\u2010species through direct count of the Spike gene mutations, determination of percent nonsynonymous mutation rates and comparison of these rates to (HCV), which is in the genus Hepacivirus, family Flaviviridae. HCV is an RNA virus with a heterogeneous population of quasi\u2010species in chronically infected patients.13-152 MATERIALS AND METHODS\n2.1 Patient samples\nWe studied nasal and oropharyngeal swab specimens that were obtained from each of four patients early during symptomatic acute respiratory illness and positive for HCoV\u2010OC43 nucleic acids by multiplex RT\u2010PCR.11 Serum and nasal wash specimens were obtained at the time of acute illness and 3\u20104 weeks after illness onset. They were assayed by enzyme\u2010linked immunosorbent assay for serum IgG and nasal wash IgA antibodies to tissue culture\u2010adapted HCoV\u2010OC43 (American Type Culture Collection #VR\u20101558, GenBank: NC_005147.1) that was inactivated by psoralen compound and long\u2010wavelength ultraviolet light, as described.10, 11, 16 Severity of acute respiratory illness was measured by two scores: a self\u2010reported visual analogue scale of overall illness severity, ranging from 1 (mildest) to 10 (most severe), and a severity of influenza\u2010like symptoms and signs score that was the sum of 16 symptoms and signs that were graded on a scale of 0 (absent)\u201015 (most severe) with a maximum score of 240, as described.10, 11, 17 Respiratory and systemic symptoms of the acute illness were recorded. The patients gave written informed consent and the study was approved by the Institutional Review Boards at the VA St. Louis Health Care System and Saint Louis University. Two recombinant clones from a previous study, #1701 and #1709, each containing a 9022\u2009bp HCV insert, were used to estimate potential errors associated with Illumina sequencing.14, 15 Also, 19 HCV genotype 1a samples from an earlier report3 were available for re\u2010analysis and comparison in the current study.\n2.2 RNA extraction, RT\u2010PCR, and illumina sequencing\nTotal RNA from each nasal and oropharyngeal swab specimen sample was purified using the QIAamp Ultrasens Virus Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) according to the manufacturer's procedures. RT\u2010PCR was then applied to amplify a 4529\u2009bp amplicon spanning the full\u2010length spike gene (4086\u2009bp). In brief, 10.6\u2009\u03bcL of extracted RNA was mixed with 9.4\u2009\u03bcL RT matrix consisting of 1x SuperScript III buffer, 10\u2009mM DTT, 1\u2009\u03bcM OC43R1 (reverse primer, 5\u2032\u2010TGC CCC ACA TAC CAC ACA G\u20103\u2032, position 28\u2009164\u201028\u2009182, numbering is according to HCoV\u2010OC43 strain, GenBank accession number: AY391777), 2\u2009mM dNTPs, 20\u2009U of RNase OUT recombinant Ribonuclease Inhibitor, and 200\u2009U of SuperScript III Reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies). After 75\u2009min. incubation at 50\u00b0C and subsequent inactivation, an aliquot of 5\u2009\u03bcL of RT reaction was applied for the first round of PCR that contained 1x GC enhancer (New England Biolabs), 1x Q5 buffer (New England Biolabs), 1.6\u2009mM dNTPs, 0.4\u2009\u03bcM OC43F1 (forward primer, 5\u2032\u2010GTA CAG GTT GTT GAT TCG CG\u20103\u2032, position 23\u2009210\u201023\u2009229), 0.4\u2009\u03bcM OC43R1 and 1.6\u2009U Q5 High Fidelity DNA Polymerase (New England Biolabs). After initial heating at 94\u00b0C for 1\u2009min, cycle parameters were programmed as the first 10 cycles of 94\u00b0C for 30\u2009sec, 65\u00b0C for 30\u2009sec and 68\u00b0C for 5\u2009min followed by 20 cycles of 94\u00b0C for 30\u2009sec, 60\u00b0C for 30\u2009sec and 68 \u00b0C for 5\u2009min with a 2\u2009sec autoextension at each cycle. Two\u2009\u03bcL of the first round of PCR product was used for the second round amplification with primers OC43F2 (forward primer, 5\u2032\u2010TCT GGC CTC TCT ACC CCT ATG GC\u20103\u2032, position 23\u2009439\u201023\u2009461) and OC43R2 (reverse primer, 5\u2032\u2010CTT GAT TAC GGC ACC AAG CAT GAC\u20103\u2032, position 27\u2009944\u201027\u2009967), under the same cycle parameters as the first round of PCR. Product at expected size was gel\u2010purified using QIAquick PCR purification Kit (Qiagen) and quantitated. About 4\u20105\u2009\u03bcg of purified DNA product was subjected to library construction. The fragment library was constructed using Illumina Nextera XT DNA library preparation kit, and followed by Illumina sequencing on NextSeq 500 machine with 1 \u00d7 250\u2009bp read output.\n2.3 Sequence data analysis\nWe first estimated the error rate associated with Illumina sequencing using two recombinant HCV clones. In doing so, raw sequence reads in fastq format were first filtered in PRINSEQ (v\u20090.19.5) for quality control, including read length \u226570\u2009bp, mean read quality score \u226525, low complexity with DUST score \u22647, ambiguous bases \u22641% and all duplicates.18 Filtered reads were mapped onto HCV genotype 1a prototype strain H77 (GenBank accession number AY009606) using a gapped aligner Bowtie 2.19 Mapped files were then converted into binary format (BAM), sorted and indexed in SAMtools20 followed by local realignment and base quality recalibration in Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK).21 Next, by converting post\u2010alignment BAM files into mpileup format in SAMtools, the consensus sequence for each clone was called in VarScan (v\u20092.2.3) with the settings of \u22651,000\u2009x coverage, \u226525 base quality at a position to count a read and \u226550% mutation frequency.22, 23 The entire pipeline was repeated using individual consensus sequences. Mutations were called at each position in VarScan under the setting of 0.5% frequency and base quality from 15 to 40, followed by manual check in the Integrative Genomics Viewer.22\nUsing the value of base quality to define a mutation from above analysis, similar procedures were applied to four patient samples. The HCoV\u2010OC43 strain (GenBank AY391777) was used as the reference at initial mapping. Over the entire coronavirus Spike gene, the mutation load, the total number of mutations at a given site, was counted through sliding windows, size\u2009=\u2009300\u2009bp, overlap\u2009=\u2009100\u2009bp. Finally, under the frame of full\u2010length HCoV Spike gene (4086\u2009bp), the nature of each mutation, either synonymous or nonsynonymous, was determined using a custom script.24\n2.4 Phylogenetic analysis\nThe consensus full\u2010length HCoV spike sequences from four patients and reference sequences retrieved from GenBank were used for phylogenetic analysis.

When applicable, data were expressed as mean value and standard deviation. P\u2009<\u20090.05 was considered statistically significant.\n2.6 Data availability\nRaw sequence data in fastq format from all four patient samples were archived in NCBI Sequence Read Archive (SRA) under SRA accession number SRP071020.3 RESULTS\n3.1 Clinical characteristics of HCoV infections and antibody responses\nSamples 3 and 4, both genotype D, were collected within a month of each other in December 2010 and January 2011 from two older patients with significant acute respiratory and systemic symptoms (Table 1). The patients had underlying chronic cardiopulmonary diseases and diabetes mellitus. The two illnesses were associated with greater than a fourfold increase in nasal wash IgA antibody titers but only one with at least a fourfold increase in serum IgG antibody titer to HCoV\u2010OC43, comparing acute illness to convalescent specimens collected 3\u20104 weeks after illness onset (Table 1).\nTable 1.

Both had acute respiratory and systemic symptoms that may have been less severe than those reported by the two patients with genotype D isolates (Table 1). One of the two illnesses with genotype B viruses was associated with a greater than fourfold increase in nasal wash IgA antibody titer to HCoV\u2010OC43, but neither had a fourfold rise in serum IgG antibody titer to HCoV\u2010OC43, comparing acute illness to convalescent specimens collected 3\u20104 weeks after illness onset (Table 1).\n3.2 Quantitation of HCoV\u2010OC43 mutation load\nThe raw data output indicated 70.1% of bases read had a quality score greater than 30. Interpretation of the distribution statistics of base quality scores over read length resulted in trimming the read length at the 3\u2032 end by 6\u201010%. The final results of the quality control are shown in Supplemental Table. The large output gave a very deep base coverage for each HCoV sample, the average was 94\u2009899\u2009\u00b1\u200921\u2009405 (Supplemental Fig. S1).\nTo estimate the error rate associated with library construction and Illumina sequencing, mutations were called from two recombinant HCV clones, #1701 and #1709, under a range of base quality settings. Even if a mutation was counted under the base quality as low as 15, there were no differences in the consensus sequences derived either from Illumina or from gene\u2010walking Sanger sequencing (data not shown). However, the number of individual mutations had a sharp drop from the base quality 25\u201030 (Supplemental Fig. S2). Under the conditions of 0.5% mutation frequency and base quality score of \u226530, there were a total of 31 mutations in the two HCV clone samples, suggesting an error rate of about 1.76 mutations per kb.\nApplying the same criteria for the coronavirus samples, a total of 121 mutations for all four samples were identified with an average number of mutations of 30.3\u2009\u00b1\u200910.2 (range: 20\u201040 mutations per sample), which is significantly higher than that expected from the Illumina sequencing error rate (121 vs 28.76 mutations, P\u2009=\u20094.2\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u221214). Nonsynonymous mutations accounted for between 61% and 90% of the total mutations (Table 2). No deletions or recombinations were detected. Of the 121 viral mutations, those with frequencies greater than 2% occurred at six positions: Spike gene position numbers 79, 81, 1229, 1859, 2244, and 2858 (Table 3).\nTable 2.

Using consensus sequences, a Neighbor\u2010joining tree showed phylogenetically that two of the subjects\u2019 samples were genotype D and two were genotype B strains of HCoV\u2010OC43 (Fig. 2A and B). The two genotype B samples both had high mutation frequencies at spike gene nucleotide positions 79 (36.92% and 45.12%) and 81 (7.96% and 7.07%), whereas the two genotype D samples had mutation frequencies of 0.92% and 0.82% at position 81, and less than 0.5% for position 79.\nFigure 1\nOpen in figure viewerPowerPoint\nSliding window analysis of viral mutation loads, calculated as normalized Shannon entropy, over the entire HCoV\u2010OC43 Spike gene (4086 bp) for the four clinical samples\nFigure 2\nOpen in figure viewerPowerPoint\nNeighbor\u2010joining trees constructed with HCoV consensus sequences.

However, nonsynonymous mutations as a percentage of the total mutations were higher among the HCoV\u2010OC43 isolates than among the 19 HCV genotype 1a patient isolates (76.7\u2009\u00b1\u200914% vs 26\u2009\u00b1\u20098%, P\u2009=\u20093.5\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u22129).\n3.4 Consensus amino acid sequences for HCoV\u2010OC43\nThe alignment of Spike genes of consensus amino acid sequences show differences between the four clinical strains and the prototype AY391777 strain particularly at the N and C terminal ends of the S1 subunit, and at the S1 and S2 subunit cleavage site, (a.a. 762\u2010766) with a smaller number of amino acid differences in the S2 subunit (Fig. 3). The high genetic mutation rates at sites 79 and 81 correspond to several amino acid changes compared to the prototype strain between amino acid positions 20 and 31.\nFigure 3\nOpen in figure viewerPowerPoint\nTight alignment of consensus amino acid sequences for the Spike genes of the four HCoV\u2010OC43 clinical samples and the prototype strain, AY391777. Dots indicated the identity and the asterisk donated stop codons4 DISCUSSION\nThrough Illumina sequencing, we have introduced high\u2010resolution HCoV\u2010OC43 Spike gene mutational load to quantify viral quasi\u2010species population diversity. The experimental method allows the role of HCoV\u2010OC43 Spike gene heterogeneity to be investigated in a manner not previously reported. The HCoV\u2010OC43 Spike gene does have quasi\u2010species, but the magnitude is almost 10 times lower than the quasi\u2010species found in HCV, while the nonsynonymous mutations take a higher percentage of the total mutation load for HCoV\u2010OC43 than HCV genotype 1a. It should be noted that the Spike gene was amplified with the gene\u2010specific primers. Although these primers are located in the conserved HCoV HE and NS2 domains, the missing of potentially heterogeneous viral variants during the amplification cannot be excluded. As a consequence, quasi\u2010species diversity of HCoV may be underestimated in the current study in comparison to the use of degenerate primers or primer\u2010independent approaches. Viral replicative dynamics, population size, and host immune responses may contribute to this observation, and the finding has implications in terms of HCoV evolution and treatment. High mutation load facilitates the evolution of viral populations in response to external pressure. Given their slightly deleterious nature;27 however, excessive nonsynonymous mutations can be detrimental to such adaptive evolution.28 Consequently, accumulation of deleterious mutation load during viral infection may contribute to self\u2010limited active infection. In the case of HCoV\u2010OC43, this could contribute to short, self\u2010limited respiratory tract infections compared to HCV, which is a chronic, systemic viral infection with ongoing viral replication. However, genetic diversity manifested by a cloud of quasi\u2010species in some viral systems can be linked to pathogenicity and shown to allow adaptation to new environments such as infection of new hosts.29 If clonal virus populations are present in human infections with MERS\u2010CoV,30, 31 this could increase the chances of epidemic spread of a particularly virulent strain.32 Infections with a cloud of viral strains may enhance spread, for instance, by increasing the chance of a virulent strain being transmitted, or reduce it due to defective and less virulent strains being present. MERS\u2010CoV genome sequences from dromedary camels indicate presence of quasi\u2010species in single samples.30 Recent deep sequencing analyses reported intra\u2010patient viral heterogeneity during a 2015 outbreak of MERS\u2010CoV and the possibility that host immune response provided selection pressure to favor genetic heterogeneity.33, 34 Intra\u2010patient viral heterogeneity may have contributed to transmissibility.33\nOur four clinical isolates were of the genotypes B and D which have been described as circulating in recent years rather than genotype A.4 Alignment of spike gene consensus amino acid sequences compared to the AY391777 prototype strain sequence (genotype A) indicates the majority of changes were in the S1 subunit. The proteolytic cleavage site of S1 and S2 subunits for the four clinical strains in our study had the RRSRR motif rather than the RRSRG motif of the prototype strain. This G to R substitution at amino acid 766 may result in increased cleavability and the cleavage process may play a part in fusion activity and viral infectivity.4, 35\nThere were minimal amino acid changes at Spike gene nucleotide positions 448\u2010459 (whole genome positions 24\u2009091\u201024\u2009102) in the glomerular part of the Spike gene, encoding the TQDG (a.a. positions 150\u2010153), and low mutation frequencies in that region for our four clinical isolates, although all four had a Y154V substitution. This is in the lectin domain of the S1 subunit involved in attachment of the virus to the cellular receptor which is a derivative of neuraminic acid.36 The TQDG sequence may have evolutionary and functional importance, is not present in the closely related bovine coronaviruses and not inserted in some strains of HCoV\u2010OC43.36 Four critical sugar\u2010binding residues Y168, E188, W190, and H191 were present in our HCoV\u2010OC43 isolates corresponding to Y162, E182, W184, and H185 in the bovine coronavirus sequence.37\nThe receptor\u2010binding of SARS\u2010CoV in the S1 carboxy\u2010terminal domain around the receptor binding motif involving amino acids 479 and 487 are areas where nonsynonymous substitutions and genetic diversity occurred for our HCoV\u2010OC43 isolate sequences. These areas are important for binding affinity to human angiotensin\u2010converting enzyme two for SARS\u2010CoV, and host immune responses.38 Our isolates had nonsynonymous substitutions at amino acid residues 259 and 260\u2010264 in the N\u2010terminal domain of S1, and, in particular, had nonsynonymous amino acid substitutions within the region between amino acids 471 and 550 at a putative receptor binding domain of HCoV\u2010OC43 (a.a. positions 339\u2010549).4 In other HCoV strains, for instance HCoV\u2010229E, antibody neutralization of the virus is dependent on the antigenic phenotype of the S1 subunit region.39 Hence, this may also be a factor for HCoV\u2010OC43 needing further study. Our patients all had acute upper respiratory and systemic signs and symptoms. The small number evaluated here precludes conclusions about pathogenicity and viral mutation rate patterns, but this approach opens up pathways to future study.\nIn conclusion, quasi\u2010species were present in our HCoV\u2010OC43 strains involving areas of the S1 subunit of the Spike gene that may affect evolution of the viral binding process and antigenicity, as well as host specificity. Further studies are needed to more fully characterize the extent of quasi\u2010species in more clinical isolates and their relation to disease characteristics and host immune responses. Nonsynonymous mutations were more frequent than synonymous ones, contributing to the hypothesis that the mutations are important to viral persistence in the human population over time and to disease pathogenesis.ACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThis work was supported by Veterans Affairs (VA) Research, Department of Veterans Affairs Office of Research and Development.

These cases of pneumonia were found to be related to a large seafood and animal market in Wuhan, where local government agencies quickly adopted sanitation and disinfection measures. Now, it is known that these cases of pneumonia were caused by a novel betacoronavirus, that is, the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019\u2010nCoV).3-12\nThen, the genome sequence and amino acid sequences were originally released by several research groups from different countries.13-15 The genome of the newly discovered CoV consists of a single, positive\u2010stranded RNA that is about 30k nucleotides long. The overall genome organization of the newly discovered CoV is similar to that of other coronaviruses. The newly sequenced virus genome encodes the open reading frames (ORFs) common to all betacoronaviruses, containing ORF1ab that encodes several enzymatic proteins, the spike\u2010surface glycoprotein (S protein), the small envelope protein (E protein), the matrix protein (M protein), and the nucleocapsid protein (N protein), as well as several nonstructural accessory proteins. Currently, the specific primers and probes for detection 2019\u2010nCoV were synthesized and fabricated against the genetic targets such as ORF1ab and N gene region. According to the gene sequencing data, Wu et al, Tao et al, and Uehara et al initially resolved the primary sequences of ten critical proteins, that is, ORF1ab polyprotein, surface glycoprotein, ORF3a protein, envelope protein, membrane glycoprotein, ORF6 protein, ORF7a protein, ORF8 protein, nucleocapsid phosphoprotein, and ORF10 protein, and published them on National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI).\nWithin the past several months, with the new coronavirus pneumonia becoming more and more serious, the domestic research team is urgently tackling the problem. In recent days, relevant basic research has made rapid progress. Xu et al showed that the 2019\u2010nCoV shared with the SARS/SARS\u2010like coronaviruses a common ancestor that resembles the bat coronavirus HKU9\u20101. Their work also pointed to the important discovery that the RBD domain of the 2019\u2010nCoV S\u2010protein supports strong interaction with human ACE2 molecules despite its sequence diversity with SARS\u2010CoV S\u2010protein and thus the 2019\u2010nCoV poses a significant public health risk for human transmission via the S\u2010protein\u2013ACE2 binding pathway.16 On this basis of the structure of 3CL hydrolase (Mpro) of 2019\u2010nCoV, the joint team integrated the strategy of virtual screening and enzymology test, focused on the drug screening for the marketed drugs, as well as the self\u2010built \u201cdatabase of high\u2010yield compounds\u201d and \u201cdatabase of compounds from medicinal plants\u201d, and quickly found 30 kinds of possible treatments for 2019\u2010nCoV drugs, active natural products, and traditional Chinese medicine. A joint research team from the structural pharmacology and pharmaceutical chemistry laboratory has been working on the current outbreak of 2019\u2010nCoV pneumonia and their results showed that papain\u2010like protease (PLP) encoded by coronavirus nsp3 played an important role in viral genome replication and escape from the antivirus natural immunity of the host. PLP not only has protein hydrolase activity but also has the activity of de ubiquitinase (DUB). PLP uses its protein hydrolase activity and DUB activity to evade the host's antiviral immune response and inhibit the expression of interferon through a series of molecular mechanisms. It is another enzyme besides the coronavirus 3CL hydrolase, which are important proteins necessary for human infection. To find the potential drugs to inhibit the 2019\u2010nCoV coronavirus, the research team found that the 2019\u2010nCoV PLP sequence has 86% amino acid homology with SARS\u2010CoV PLP sequence. The research team built the protein structure of 2019\u2010nCoV PLP by using homology modeling method, defined its drug\u2010binding pocket, and screened the active molecules from the existing drug compound library of ZINC, the database of traditional Chinese medicine and natural products established by their own laboratory by using the computer\u2010aided structure\u2010based virtual screening method. Then, 33 potential inhibitors of 2019\u2010nCoV PLP were selected and expected to have possible anti\u20102019\u2010nCoV activity. Several scientists speculated that Remdesivir may help fight the new coronavirus. The genetic material of the RNA virus is RNA (RNA ribonucleic acid). For the replication of the RNA virus genome, most of them need intermediate synthesis, which requires virus\u2010specific polymerase (RNA dependent RNA polymerase, RdRp, or RNA dependent DNA polymerase, RdDp). These polymerases are ideal targets for the design of antiviral drugs. Remdesivir works by interfering with RdRp. It is a precursor drug of adenosine analog. After triphosphate in vivo, it is incorporated into the newly synthesized RNA chain of the virus as a substrate, and then the synthesis of the virus genome is interrupted.17-21\nIt can be predicted that the research results of computational biology and bioinformatics will play an important role in the process of resistance to new coronavirus.22, 23 Realization and prediction of these structural and nonstructural proteins from 2019\u2010nCoV should be used by more scientific and technological workers, especially those engaged in drug research and development. Using the observed and achieved three\u2010dimensional models of these structural and nonstructural proteins, the screening of potential drugs against 2019\u2010nCoV could be carried out. In this study, using the amino acid sequences released on NCBI, we try to clarify the closest sequences and identify the most suitable template existed for homology modeling of several crucial proteins of 2019\u2010nCoV. This study would be beneficial to the next drug screening research.2 MATERIALS, METHODS, AND PROCEDURES\n2.1 Computational tools\nThe Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) could find regions of local similarity between sequences.24-29 The program compares nucleotide or protein sequences to sequence databases and calculates the statistical significance of matches. The maximum number of aligned sequences to display was set to 100. The expected number of chance matches in a random model was set to 10. The length of the seed that initiates an alignment was set to 6. SWISS\u2010MODEL is a fully automated protein structure homology\u2010modeling server, accessible via the ExPASy web server or from the program DeepView (Swiss Pdb\u2010Viewer).30-33 The purpose of this server is to make protein modeling accessible to all life science researchers worldwide. Building a homology model comprises four main steps: identification of structural template(s), alignment of the target sequence and template structure(s), model\u2010building, and model quality evaluation. Clustal Omega is the latest addition to the Clustal family.34, 35 Clustal Omega is a multiple sequence alignment program that uses seeded guide trees and HMM profile\u2010profile techniques to generate alignments between three or more sequences. It produces biologically meaningful multiple sequence alignments of divergent sequences. In this study, using three popular online tools, that is, BLAST, SWISS\u2010MODEL, and Clustal Omega, we performed sequence alignment investigations on these 10 primary sequences of 2019\u2010nCoV.\n2.2 Experimental procedures\nThe structures of the proteins from ORF1ab currently published on RCSB Protein Data Bank (PDB) and yet recommended by Protein Information Resource (PIR) were summarized in Table S1. To construct the proteins from ORF1ab, we distinguished the sequences related to the crystallized structures of the proteins from ORF1ab. After careful evaluation and screening, we compared the sequence of 2GDT, 2GRI, 2ACF, 2JZF, 2FE8, 2K87, 1Q2W, 2AHM, 6NUR, 1QZ8, 5C8S, 6JYT, 2H85, and 2XYQ with the whole sequence of 2019\u2010nCoV ORF1ab using Clustal Omega. After performing sequence alignment, we identified the sequences associated with these PDB files. Then, we searched for the template proteins of these specific sequences using SWISS\u2010MODEL. For proteins from 2019\u2010nCoV other than ORF1ab, we directly searched for the template proteins of their sequences using SWISS\u2010MODEL.3 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION\n3.1 Sequence alignment of ORF1ab among 2019\u2010nCoV, SARS\u2010CoV, and MERS\u2010CoV\nAccording to BLAST analysis, the sequence identity of ORF1ab protein between 2019\u2010nCoV and SARS\u2010CoV is more than 90% with the query cover of about 100% while the sequence identity of ORF1ab protein between 2019\u2010nCoV and MERS\u2010CoV is less than 60% with the query cover of about 98%, which proves that the 2019\u2010nCoV shared a better sequence homology toward the sequences of SARS\u2010CoV than that of MERS\u2010CoV, which is consistent with previous research results.8 Using the Clustal Omega, the sequence alignment of 2019\u2010nCoV and SARS\u2010CoV, 2019\u2010nCoV and MERS\u2010CoV was carried out (see Figures S1 and S2).\n3.2 Homology modeling of the proteins encoded by ORF1ab\nCoronavirus family members are important pathogens of many domestic animals, pets, including human beings, causing a variety of acute and chronic diseases. Coronavirus has a large genome RNA, 27 to 32\u2009kb in length, encoding structural proteins, nonstructural proteins, and some auxiliary proteins. The nonstructural protein of coronavirus is hydrolyzed from the virus\u2010encoded polyprotein 1ab. These nonstructural proteins are important functional proteins of coronavirus, which are involved in the regulation of viral genome RNA replication and subgenomic RNA transcription, or involved in genome replication and transcription as transcription/replication complexes, and involved in infection of the host.\nIt is known that the Replicase polyprotein 1ab (alternative name: ORF1ab polyprotein) could be cleaved into the following 15 chains: (1) Host translation inhibitor nsp1 (alternative names: Leader protein, nsp1), (2) Nonstructural protein 2 (alternative names: p65 homolog, nsp2), (3) Papain\u2010like proteinase (alternative names: PL\u2010Pro, Nonstructural protein 3, nsp3), (4) Nonstructural protein 4 (alternative name: nsp4), (5) 3C\u2010like proteinase (alternative names: 3CL\u2010Pro, nsp5), (6) Nonstructural protein 6 (alternative name: nsp6), (7) Nonstructural protein 7 (alternative name: nsp7), (8) Nonstructural protein 8 (alternative name: nsp8), (9) Nonstructural protein 9 (alternative name: nsp9), (10) Nonstructural protein 10 (alternative names: Growth factor\u2010like peptide, GFL, nsp10), (11) RNA\u2010directed RNA polymerase (alternative names: RdRp, nsp12), (12) Helicase (alternative names: Hel, nsp13), (13) Guanine\u2010N7 methyltransferase (alternative names: ExoN, nsp14), (14) Uridylate\u2010specific endoribonuclease (alternative names: NendoU, nsp15), and (15) 2\u2019\u2010O\u2010methyltransferase (alternative name: nsp16).\nHere, we summarized the main findings mentioned in this section on the structure prediction of the proteins encoded by ORF1ab using the homology modeling method in Table 1. Specific measures and experimental details to obtain these valuable results are disclosed in the supplementary documents (also see Figures S3\u2010S62). According to the recent reports mentioned in chapter 1, the PL\u2010Pro, 3CL\u2010Pro, and RdRp should be important targets for design antiviral drugs against 2019\u2010nCoV. In addition, the cartoons of the proteins modeled in this section are shown in Figure 1. We found that the main color of these ribbons is composed of blue, indicating that the structures of these proteins are stretched to a considerable extent.\nTable 1.

Under the electron microscope, the surface of virus particles has a club like protrusion, which is composed of spike protein (S protein). The envelope of the virus consists of membrane glycoprotein (M protein), which is embedded in the envelope of the virus through three transmembrane domains. In addition, a small amount of small transmembrane protein envelope protein (E protein) also appeared in the envelope. Finally, the nucleocapsid protein (N protein) binds to the RNA genome in the form of beads, forming a helically symmetric nucleocapsid.\nHere, we explored the rationality and feasibility of the homology modeling of other proteins. According to BLAST search results, it is found that SARS spike glycoprotein is a good template for constructing 2019\u2010nCoV surface glycoprotein. We also found that MERS spike glycoprotein is similar to 2019\u2010nCoV surface glycoprotein. But the homology of SARS S protein (PDB ID: 6ACC_A) and 2019\u2010nCoV S protein is about 76%, and the query coverage rate is 95%; the homology of MERS S protein (PDB ID: 5X59) and 2019\u2010nCoV S protein is about 34%, and the query coverage rate is 74% (see Figures S63 and S64). Using SWISS\u2010MODEL, 6ACD_C can be used as a potential template for modeling 2019\u2010nCoV S protein (see Figure S65). Then, the homology modeling of S protein could be realized (see Figure S66). Next, we try to perform the homology modeling of ORF3a protein. Nevertheless, although 2019\u2010nCoV ORF3a protein and SARS\u2010CoV ORF3a protein are highly homologous (see Figure S67), the crystal structure of this protein is unknown up to now (see Figure S68). Fortunately, the crystal structure of the template protein for modeling 2019\u2010nCoV E protein is realized experimentally (see Figure S69). Using SWISS\u2010MODEL, the template was found successfully (see Figure S70). The sequence identity is more than 90% (see Figure S71). Regretfully, the crystal structure of the template protein for modeling membrane glycoprotein and ORF6 protein is deficient (see Figures S72\u2010S75). Hopefully, the structure of the template protein of ORF7a protein has been identified experimentally (see Figure S76). Using SWISS\u2010MODEL, the template was found successfully (see Figure S77). The sequence identity is more than 90% (see Figure S78). Currently, there is no suitable template protein for the homology modeling of ORF8 protein (see Figures S79 and S80). Then, we tried to model the structure of the N protein. We found that the N protein would be divided into two parts and the two parts need to be modeled independently (see Figure S81). The sequence identity is more than 90% (see Figures S82 and S83). ORF10 protein is a short peptide, and there is no template available at present.\nHere, we summarized the main findings mentioned in this section on the structure prediction of the other proteins from 2019\u2010nCoV using the homology modeling method in Table 2. Coronavirus replication is initiated by the binding of S protein to cell surface receptors. S protein consists of two functional subunits. S1 (globule) is used for receptor binding and S2 (stem) is used for membrane fusion. The specific interaction between S1 and homologous receptors can trigger the conformational change of the S2 subunit, which leads to the fusion of virus envelope and cell membrane and release of nucleocapsid into the cytoplasm. Receptor binding largely determines the host range and histotropism of coronavirus. Thus, the S protein should be a critical candidate for drug screening or vaccine design against 2019\u2010nCoV.36, 37 In addition, the cartoons of the proteins modeled in this section are shown in Figure 2. We found that the main color of these ribbons is composed of red, demonstrating that there are some squeezing and collision between the atoms in these structures to some degree. Consequently, before these models can be used as targets for computer\u2010aided drug design, conformation optimization based on molecular mechanics or molecular dynamics should be performed sufficiently.\nTable 2.

During the outbreak of SARS in 2003, scientists used protease inhibitors to reduce the viral load of patients, and protease inhibitors were also proved effective for MERS. Today's new coronaviruses, like SARS and MERS viruses, are all coronaviruses. Therefore, scientists speculate that protease inhibitors can reduce a load of new coronaviruses in patients. Protease inhibitor is a kind of drug targeting protease to treat AIDS. At present, the National Health Commission has recommended that anti\u2010AIDS drugs can be included in the trial. Chinese scientists are testing the anti\u2010HIV drug program to see if it is effective against the new coronavirus. Several research groups from different countries reported their sequencing results and showed that this newly sequenced virus genome encodes the open reading frames (ORFs) common to all \u03b2\u2010coronaviruses, including ORF1ab that encodes many enzymatic proteins, the spike\u2010surface glycoprotein (S\u2010protein), the small envelope protein (E\u2010protein), the matrix protein (M\u2010protein), and the nucleocapsid protein (N\u2010protein), as well as several nonstructural proteins.43 2019\u2010nCoV shared a better sequence homology toward the sequences of SARS\u2010CoV than that of MERS\u2010CoV. We demonstrated that it is likely that they share considerable sequence consistent with the SARS or SARS\u2010like coronaviruses, which is in accordance with the previously published work.44 High sequence identities and similarities between 2019\u2010nCoV and SARS\u2010CoV were found. We searched the homologous templates of all structural and nonstructural proteins of 2019\u2010nCoV. These protein models should be useful for molecular docking investigations and molecular dynamics simulations. Moreover, these resulting structures would be meaningful for further structure\u2010based virtual screening and related computer\u2010aided drug design.ACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThis study was supported by the Project of Guangdong Baiyun University (2017BYKY29), the Project of Inner Mongolia University of Science & Technology (2017QDL\u2010B14), the Natural Science Foundation of Inner Mongolia (2019MS01013), the Opening Project of Guangdong Province Key Laboratory of Computational Science at the Sun Yat\u2010sen University (2018015), and High\u2010Level Talent Start\u2010Up Research Project of Foshan University (Gg040934).CONFLICT OF INTERESTS\nThe authors declare that there are no conflict of interests.AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS\nSD and YLL designed the project.

Dromedary camels are considered as potential reservoirs for the virus and seem to be the only animal host which may transmit the infection to human. Further studies are required to better understand the animal sources of zoonotic transmission route and the risks of this infection. A primary sero\u2010prevalence study of MERS\u2010CoV preexisting neutralizing antibodies in Dromedary camel serum was conducted in Tabuk, western north region of KSA, in order to assess the seopositivity of these animals and to explain their possible role in the transmission of the infection to Human. One hundred seventy one (171) serum samples were collected from healthy dromedary camels with different ages and genders in Tabuk city and tested for specific serum IgG by ELISA using the receptor\u2010binding S1 subunits of spike proteins of MERS\u2010CoV. 144 (84,21%) of the total camel sera shown the presence of protein\u2010specific antibodies against MERS\u2010CoV. These results may provide evidence that MERS\u2010CoV has previously infected dromedary camels in Tabuk and may support the possible role of camels in the human infection.1 INTRODUCTION\nThe Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS\u2010CoV) is positive\u2010sense, single\u2010stranded RNA novel species of the genus Beta\u2010coronavirus and the family of Coronaviridae.\nSince Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) was described in September 2012, 1794 laboratory\u2010confirmed cases of infection including at least 731 (40,8%) related deaths have been reported by WHO in the kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA).1\nMost MERS cases have been reported in the Arab peninsula, in Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates, and other imported index cases, have been reported in France, Germany, Italy, Tunisia, and the United Kingdom.2, 3\nAlthough instances of human\u2010to\u2010human transmission of MERS\u2010CoV infection have been documented between case\u2010patients and others in close contact, including patients and family members, the sources of infection for most patients remain usually unknown.\nThe epidemiology of the disease, so far is suggestive of multiple zoonotic transmissions from an animal reservoir leading to human infection, sometimes with secondary transmission events in human.\nPhylogenetically closely related, viruses have been detected in bats in some countries in Africa and Europe.4, 5 A very short fragment of the RNA\u2010dependent RNA polymerase gene that was genetically identical to MERS\u2010CoV has been detected in a bat captured surrounding the residence of a human case with MERS.6\nEvidence also provides that MERS\u2010CoV has been circulating in camels at least since 1992,7 while human infected cases were newly reported in KSA.8 This suggests that camels may play a role of primary reservoir for transmitting the viral infection to human.\nThe hypothesis of MERS\u2010CoV transmission from dromedary camels to humans was reported in a study undertaken on human infection with MERS\u2010CoV after exposure to infected camels in Saudi Arabia.9 Similarities in genome sequence between MERS\u2010CoVs isolated from dromedary camels and humans were described in different studies and suggest the potential role of camels in human infection.9-12\nSince MERS\u2010CoV specific antibodies following Coronavirus infection remain detectable for many years,13 seroepidemiology of potential animal species for MERS\u2010CoV\u2010specific antibody is a necessary approach to identify candidate species for further investigation. Serological approaches, including ELISA and immunoflourescence assays are well used for specific antibodies detection in human and camels, while virus neutralization which was considered by some authors as a gold\u2010standard test, is used for infectious virus detection.14, 15\nEven if MERS\u2010CoV circulation was well studied in many regions in KSA since its emergence in 2012, no data are available about camel infection in Tabuk, north\u2010west region of the kingdom. The main objective of this study was to assess the sero\u2010prevalence of MERS\u2010CoV preexisting neutralizing antibodies in the serum of healthy dromedary camels in Tabuk city in order to evaluate the immune status of these animals and their protection against new MERS\u2010CoV infections. The eventual presence of MERS\u2010CoV antibodies in Dromedary camels can explain the possible role of these animals in the transmission of infection to Human which is not clearly described till now.2 MATERIALS AND METHODS\n2.1 Serum sample collection\nA serological study was carried from January to April 2016. One hundred seventy one (171) serum samples were collected from three herds of Dromedary camels (Camelus dromedarius) located around Tabuk city. The three sites of sample collection had been chosen for their localization near Tabuk city and camels are in continues contact with humans (owners, farmers, and other people). The areas of sample collection are not considered as geographically separated and don't present any difference of environmental conditions which can have an influence on camels infection by the virus. According to the farmers and the animal owners, all selected dromedary camels were born and bred in Tabuk and aged from 1 to 5 years. Serum samples were collected by a veterinarian from only healthy camels in order to avoid unnecessary suffering of the animals or possible accidents of the handling personnel. Camels showing clinical signs of any disease were excluded from this study.\nAmong 171 samples, 36 were collected in January 2016, 74 in February, 30 in March and 31 in April. In total, 93 camels were males, 78 females, 71 juveniles (<2 years) and 100 adults (3\u20135 years).\n2.2 Serological analysis\nBlood sera were separated, diluted at 1:100 and analyzed for MERS\u2010CoV specific antibodies using the anti\u2010MERS\u2010CoV ELISA Camel (IgG) kit manufactured by EUROIMMUN AG (L\u00fcbeck, Germany). This test is based on the recombinant MERS\u2010CoV spike protein subunit\u20101 and has successfully been used by other authors evaluating MERS\u2010CoV in camels.16\nOptical Density (OD) was measured at 450\u2009nm using a MINDRAY MR\u201096 ELISA reader.\n2.3 Statistical analysis\nStatistical analysis was performed on SPSS v. 22.0 software (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL). Data were expressed as percentage for continuous variables, which were normally distributed, or as percentages of total for categorical variables. Pearson \u03c72 test was used to assess inter\u2013group significance.\n2.4 Ethical approval\nThis research was ethically approved by the research ethic committee at the University of Tabuk.3 RESULTS\nOne hundred seventy one serum samples were collected from three areas in Tabuk city and analyzed by ELISA technique for MERS\u2010CoV specific antibodies detection. The three farms are located around the city of Tabuk and are not considered as geographically separated. A total of 93 of 171 dromedary camels were males and 78 were females, 71 were juveniles, and 100 were adults.\nAccording to the manufacture instruction of the ELISA kit, results are interpreted as: Positive (Ratio\u2009\u2265\u20091.1), Negative (Ratio\u2009<\u20090.8), and borderline (0.8\u2009<\u2009Ratio <1.1) with Ratio\u2009=\u2009Control or Sample OD/Calibrator OD (cut\u2010Off).\nIn total, 144 samples (84.21%) were MERS\u2010CoV antibody positive, 22 (12.86%) were negative and 5 (2.92%) were borderline. In males, 77 (82.8%) were positive and 14 (15%) were negative. In females, 67 (85.9%) were positive and 08 (10.30%) were negative. The statistical analysis, using Pearson \u03c72 test, didn't show any significant difference of antibody prevalence between males and females (P\u2009=\u20090.542). According to the age, 66 (92.95%) of juveniles were positive and 04 (5.63%) were negative. From adults, 78 (78%) were positive and 18 (18%) were negative (Table 1 and Figure 1). The prevalence of MERS\u2010CoV antibodies in juveniles was significantly higher than prevalence in adults (P\u2009=\u20090.030).\nTable 1.

This study is the first to present data about the camel MERS\u2010CoV in the region of Tabuk, in the north\u2010west of the country. Published studies about KSA were mainly undertaken in the central and southern regions of the Kingdom (Riyadh, Gizan, Hafuf\u2026). Blood sera collected from 171 camels were analyzed by CoV ELISA camel (IgG) test for antibody detection against the S1 antigen of MERS\u2010CoV according to the manufacture instructions. This test has been successfully used and evaluated by many authors for MERS\u2010CoV detection in camels.11, 16, 17\nResults have shown that a high number (85%) of dromedary camels from the different farms of Tabuk city have MERS\u2010CoV neutralizing antibodies. Specific antibodies were detected in serum samples collected in 2016 from healthy camels, all originated from Tabuk and with different ages and genders. This first finding suggests a longstanding presence of MERS\u2010CoV in camels in this region of KSA which has known an epidemic human MERS\u2010CoV infection since 2012.8 Our results do not provide proof for the presence of MERS\u2010CoV in dromedary camels but they do support the finding of Meyer et al18 suggesting that MERS\u2010CoV or a closely related coronavirus antibody detection, is not a new infection in dromedary camels as they don't present signs and symptoms for the CoV disease. A current infection and active viral excretion need to be confirmed by respiratory sample analysis, viral isolation on cell culture and/or by RNA material detection by molecular approaches.\nOur results are in agreement with those published in a study conducted in the central and southern regions of KSA 2013 showing a high rate of camels with MERS\u2010CoV specific antibodies.7 Indeed, 203 serum samples from dromedary camels collected from Hafuf, Gizan, and Riyadh and screened by ELISA test showed that 74% of the animals were found to have antibodies to MERS\u2010CoV.7 In the same study, 264 archived serum samples collected from dromedary camels from 1992 to 2010 in Riyadh and Kharj were also analyzed by ELISA and showed a high seroprevalence (92%) of MERS\u2010CoV neutralizing antibodies.7 Our data agree also with previous studies reporting wide antibody prevalence in camels in many countries, including Egypt and Oman.12, 19 In another study conducted in Oman, all serum samples from 50 dromedary camels were positive for MERS\u2010CoV specific antibodies.12 Similar results were also reached from a larger study conducted in United Arab Emirates (UAE), where 500 dromedary camels\u2019 sera screened in 2013 revealed 96% seropositivity.18 In Africa, an outbreak investigating serum samples for MERS\u2010CoV assessment in camels has also shown similar results in Nigeria (94%), Tunisia (48.5%), and Ethiopia (96.3%).20 Likewise, in a study conducted on 189 archived camel sera samples collected in 1997 from Egypt and between 1983 and 1984 from Sudan and Somalia, 81% were found to have neutralizing antibodies to MERS\u2010CoV.16 Similar results were also obtained in a study from Kenya.17 Taken together, our findings and all those from the Arabian Peninsula and Africa, suggest a wide exposure of Dromedary camels to MERS\u2010CoV which may be infected by the virus at some point in their life.\nWhile camels in the Middle East and Africa were highly exposed to MERS\u2010CoV infection, camels from Europe and Australia which are geographically isolated were not exposed to the virus.12 However, serum samples collected from 105 dromedary camels living in the archipelago of Canary Islands, between 2012 and 2013 showed that 14% have antibodies against MERS\u2010CoV.12 In another study carried out in the same islands, 170 dromedary camel sera were analyzed and only 4.1% were seropositive for MERS\u2010CoV. Data showed that all the seropositive dromedary camels for MERS\u2010CoV were all imported from Africa. In addition, 307 dromedary camels\u2019 sera collected from different regions between 2013 and 2014 in the Islands were all tested negative for specific MERS\u2010CoV antibodies.21 All these findings indicate that active MERS\u2010CoV infection did not occur in the Canary Islands.22\nThe high prevalence of camel MERS antibodies in KSA and the Arab peninsula, countries with human epidemic MERS, and the absence or low prevalence of camel MERS\u2010CoV antibodies in Europe and Australia, countries without or with few human MERS cases, could explain the potential role of camels as reservoirs of MERS\u2010CoV infection. In our study, the high prevalence of MERS\u2010CoV antibodies in camels could be explained by the acquisition of maternal immunity or by the occurrence of viral infection at the juvenile age. As the sample collection was done in 2016, the animal infection would have occurred in 2011\u20132013, before or during MERS emergence in the country. This finding can also constitute another argument supporting the hypothesis of the role of dromedary camels as potential reservoir for MERS transmission to human. Also, complete genomic sequences of dromedary camels MERS\u2010CoV were found to be similar to sequences of Human MERS\u2010CoV.10, 11 Serological studies detecting MERS\u2010CoV antibodies in archived serum samples suggested the potential role of dromedary camels in Human MERS\u2010CoV infection since similar genomic sequences of MERS\u2010CoV were found in contemporary dromedary camels and Humans.7 The only archived specimens were sera and MERS\u2010CoV sequencing has been unsuccessful.7\nOur results, although restricted to serology, provide arguments supporting the camel role in Human MERS infection but do not confirm this relationship according to the current data. Further epidemiological investigations on human exposure to dromedary camels are required to confirm this relationship. In case of implication of dromedary camels in Human MERS, some questions will arise about the absence of human infection before 2012 since high MERS\u2010CoV seroprevalence was noted in archived camel sera. Did MERS\u2010CoV emerge only as a human pathogen in 2012, or was\u2010it because of a lack of diagnostic approaches to identify the human MERS? Or also mutation has occurred to facilitate cross\u2010species transmission? More analysis of archived specimens and genome sequencing can provide clear answer to these questions.\nBy looking at the age, our results have shown a high seoprevalence of MERS\u2010CoV antibodies in all the age stages of dromedary camels but with difference between young (<2 years) and adult (>3 years) animals. Seroprevalence was significantly higher in juveniles (92%) than in adults (78%). The high frequency of seropositive camels was noted in all farms, from 85% to 100% for juveniles and from 65% to 85% for adults.\nAvailable data describing the association of camel age to MERS\u2010CoV antibodies expression are till now limited and explanations about the relation between the age and the antibody prevalence remain usually hypothetical. In our study, adult camels might be infected by the virus as juveniles as was reported by Benjamin in 2016, suggesting that MERS\u2010CoV infec\u00adtion appears to predominantly affect young dromedary camels.23 The high seroprevalence in juveniles and adults confirms also results of Hemida et al24 but with lower rates in juveniles. The same author explained the increase of the seropositivity in adult camels by the age range of the animals which were exposed for long time to the virus infection.24\nFor young camels, specific MERS\u2010CoV antibodies could be acquired from their mothers as it was reported by Kamber25 who suggests that maternal IgG antibodies in camels are acquired through the colostrum intake during the first 24\u2009h post\u2010parturition and not via the trans\u2010placental route. After 24\u2009h, antibody levels in the dam's milk decrease rapidly, and IgG levels in serum cease to rise.25 We also suggest that maternal antibodies might not have been sufficient to mediate protective immunity for them. Animals would then be exposed to new MERS\u2010CoV infection and specific antibodies would consequently increase in 1\u20132 years after, which can explain the higher seroprevalence in juveniles then in adults. The predominance of viral antibodies in young camels could also be explained by animal exposure to the virus few times post\u2010parturition and not by mother immunity, which will stimulate antibody secretion in the blood. In the two last possibilities, young camels could contract viral infection after 2012, period of epidemic MERS circulation in KSA, and production of specific antibodies would consequently increase in some months after birth. Respiratory specimens, as nasal swabs, and rectal swabs will be required for analysis to know whether anti\u2010MERS antibodies are issued from recent viral infection.\nIn relation to sex, our results have shown a high seropositivity in both males (82,8%) and females (85.9%) without a significant difference between the two genders. This information was not reported in previous studies and indicates that the sex cannot be a limiting factor in camel's infection by the virus.\nIn conclusion, our findings in Dromedary camel's sera, even if limited to serology, constitute a strong argument suggesting that MERS\u2010CoV has previously infected dromedary camels in Tabuk region. We speculate that Dromedary camels may support the role of these animals as potential reservoirs for human infection but we cannot confirm this relationship from the current data alone. Further studies including more animals and respiratory samples are needed for a larger evaluation of camel population in this region. In addition, a whole genome sequencing of camel MERS\u2010CoV is required to confirm its incrimination in human infection.ACKNOWLEDGMENT\nThe work was financially supported by the Deanship of Scientific Research (DSR) at the University of Tabuk.", "20138": "", "20432": "", "1890030410": "", "20095": "", "20498": "", "20873": "", "1890020407": "", "25695": "What emerged in December 2019 as a cluster of respiratory ailments with inexplicable etiological findings in Wuhan has now claimed roughly 259 lives, sickened nearly 12 thousand more, and spread to at least 26 more nations including Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Macao.1 Confirmed to be caused by a coronavirus, the outbreak is believed to start from the Huanan Wet Seafood Wholesale Market in Wuhan, which is the capital city of the Hubei Province, China. The World Health Organization (WHO), after being informed about the viral disease on 31st December, believes that an animal source is the most likely primary source of the pathogenic disease.2-5\nIn Virus Taxonomy, coronaviruses belong to the subfamily Orthocoronavirinae. These are known to be a family of enveloped non\u2010segmented positive\u2010sense ribonucleic acid (RNA) viruses belonging to the family Coronaviridae and the order Nidovirales. There are four known genera for coronaviruses, namely: alpha\u2010, beta\u2010, gamma\u2010, and delta\u2010coronavirus. All of the four genera are believed to have a zoonotic origin and infect both animals and humans. Whereas the alpha and beta genera originate from bats, the gamma and delta genera are derived from avian and pig gene pools.6-9\nGiven the high occurrence of coronaviruses, the large genetic variety and recurrent recombination of their genomes, and increasing human\u2010animal interface undertakings, new coronaviruses are likely to emerge sporadically in humans owing to periodic spillover events and common cross\u2010species infections. This explains the human infections of novel coronaviruses, such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS\u2010CoV) in 2002, and the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS\u2010CoV) in 2012. Once in humans, the virus has the likelihood to spread from human\u2010to\u2010human, mainly causing respiratory diseases.10-12\nIn late December 2019, some local health facilities reported cases of patients with pneumonia of unknown causes that were epidemiologically related to seafood and wet animal wholesale market in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.5 The Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) deployed a team on 31st December to work with the Hubei Provincial Health Commission to investigate the epidemiological and etiological underlyings of the disease. Following isolation of the virus from lower respiratory tract samples by a number of Chinese scientists, deep genome sequencing analysis revealed the virus as a new betacoronavirus.13 The virus was then named by WHO as the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019\u2010nCoV). According to a recent publication by Chan et al,14 the disease has shown person\u2010to\u2010person or nosocomial transmission features, implying that it can easily pass on from one person\u2010to\u2010another. One of the authors, Dr. Yuen Kwok\u2010Yung, describes the disease as \u201casymptomatic walking pneumonia\u201d due to its ability to be transmitted even within the 3 to 14 days incubation period.15 Another coauthor of a different article, Prof. Cao Bin, suggested that the Wuhan seafood market might not be the only source of the novel coronavirus. His reasoning followed from the fact that 14 of the first 41 hospitalized patients had no contacts with the Wuhan seafood market, signifying that there is the probability of other origins of the virus.10 Despite this suggestion, the virus is now widely called the \u201cWuhan virus.\u201d\nFrom the onset of the outbreak, 27 patients were originally reported at Wuhan, which was later updated to 41 on 11th January 2020. Seven of the cases were classified as severe, and one person was reported dead on the 11th of January.16 About 3 weeks later, on the 1st of February, 2020, updates on the spread of the disease indicate that over 11\u2009900 people have been infected worldwide. Figure 1 shows how many people have been confirmed to be infected by the 2019\u2010nCoV disease in different nations including mainland China (11\u2009793 cases) and its special administrative regions Hong Kong (13 cases), Macao (7 cases), and Taiwan (10 cases).1 The same Figure provides information on how many suspected cases are still pending in mainland China, the death toll, and how many patients have been cured and discharged so far. Looking at the exponential increase in infections, as confirmed by a recent publication in the Journal of Medical Virology,17 experts believe that the actual number of cases is far beyond the reported figures. Prof Neil Ferguson, a public health expert at Imperial College, is of the view that the total number of infections globally could reach 100\u2009000 by now.18 Another publication in the Lancet Medical Journal by researchers from Hong Kong estimates there could be 75\u2009815 people in Wuhan who were infected with the novel coronavirus as of 25th January.19\nFigure 1\nOpen in figure viewerPowerPoint\nConfirmed cases of 2019\u2010nCoV globally, 1st February, 20201\nBefore offering his resignation, the Wuhan Mayor, Mr. Zhou Xianwang, who has played a leading role in the fight against the sudden outbreak at its epicenter, has admitted that the city authorities delayed in disclosing information on the epidemic in a timely manner. In addition to the Mayor, several lower\u2010level officials across China have been blamed for shortcomings in dealing with disease control.1 Among them are Tang Zhihong, who has now been relieved of her position as head of the health department in Huanggang city of the Hubei province,20 Yao Zhongjing, a district market regulator at Jinan, Shandong province, and Tang Hu, head of a district health authority in Yueyang, Hunan province.1\nIn attempts to curtail the spread of the virus during what is the country's busiest travel season, many provincial authorities have announced the end of the lunar new year holidays would be extended to at least 2nd February across China, and to 9th February in Shanghai. Non\u2010essential enterprises are also delayed until February 9th in the provinces of Jiangxi, Shandong, Anhui, Guangdong, Zhejiang, Jiangsu, and Yunnan. The Chongqing municipality has equally delayed non\u2010essential enterprises in the administrative area to 9th February, while the Hubei province has delayed all enterprises until 13th February.21 Many officials have also broadened sweeping restrictions on travel activities across the republic, with several provinces including Hubei remaining under strict lockdown. Long\u2010distance bus services across the whole of China have also been banned, and according to some news sources, watch drones have been dispatched across the country to scold civilians who do not adhere to the strict regulations of wearing masks.22\nAuthorities believe that the suspension of long\u2010distance bus services, which is the cheapest mode of transport in the country, is likely to slow down the return of millions of migrant workers who have traveled over the lunar New Year celebration. In similar veins, by extending the end of the holidays from Friday to Sunday, the leaders hoped to shrink the number of mass gatherings and limit the spread of the epidemic. On the other hand, many countries including Japan, the United States, Singapore, the United Kingdom, North Korea, Papua New Guinea, Malaysia, Philippines, and Hong Kong have temporarily banned visas to either all Chinese citizens or citizens from the Hubei province in a bid to stem the spread of the virus.23\nMeanwhile, there have been growing concerns that health facilities in Wuhan city were severely overstretched. Specific mentions were made of beds running out, as well as test kits and basic protective equipment. In response to the crisis, the city officials announced the ongoing construction of two designated makeshift infirmaries to deal with the expected upsurge in cases. Both hospitals, named Huoshenshan and Leishenshan: meaning \"Fire God Mountain\" and \"Thunder God Mountain respectively,\" are said to be able to accommodate 2500 beds collectively, after their completion on 5th February.24 An image of the current state of the Huoshenshan Hospital is shown in Figure 2.25\nFigure 2\nOpen in figure viewerPowerPoint\nHuoshenshan Hospital takes shape in Wuhan, Hubei province, on 30th January, 202025\nIn fear of the threatening transmission rate of the outbreak, many countries have announced their intentions to evacuate their citizens from the Wuhan city, the epicenter of the outbreak. However, in a statement issued on Monday 28th of January by the director\u2010general of WHO at a meeting with State Councilor Wang Yi in Beijing, Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said he is confident in China's capabilities to curb the virus and did not think it was necessary for foreigners to be evacuated from the Hubei province. At the same meeting, he also declared his approval of the Chinese government's measures to control the epidemic. That notwithstanding, some countries have already evacuated their citizens from Wuhan, the central point of the outbreak. Among them are South Korea, Australia, Japan, USA, and a number of EU countries. Many more nations, such as New Zealand, Canada, Malaysia, India, Turkey, Bangladesh, and Egypt are equally arranging flights to evacuate their nationals. All of these nations have plans of quarantining the evacuees for a minimum of 14 days, which is believed to be the longest incubation period of the 2019\u2010nCoV. This would allow health specialists to monitor their health carefully, treat any ailments that might show up within the 14 days, and also limit the human\u2010to\u2010human spread of infections in the various nations.26\nAt a press conference at Geneva on 30th January, the director\u2010general of the WHO declared the outbreak as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern and called on authorities across the world to work together to limit the rapid spread of the disease.27 Various research facilities in China, Hong Kong, Australia, Singapore, the United States, Germany, Canada, and the UK have since reinforced their efforts to invent appropriate vaccines to treat the novel virus. Among them are the Chinese CDC, Johnson and Johnson Medical Device Company, Moderna Therapeutics, Inovio Pharmaceuticals, the International Vaccine Center, and CureVac AG Biopharmaceutical Company.28, 29\nOn the frontier of treatments, while there are no definite antiviral therapies and vaccines for this infection at the moment, it is very important that global efforts are harnessed to keep the general public calm and quench unnecessary fears. While health facilities across the globe need major improvements to contain and treat infections, it is recommended that national authorities inform their citizens about the facts regarding the outbreak and advise them on what to do to stay away from the disease. As standard measures, WHO recommends the general public to frequently wash their hands using alcohol\u2010based soap and water. Consumption of raw or undercooked animals should also be avoided. Additionally, persons experiencing symptoms of fever and cough, and have difficulties breathing are advised to seek medical attention promptly. Finally, individuals are advised to wear masks and cover their mouth and nose when coughing or sneezing in public.30 With all these measures in place, the transmission of 2019\u2010nCoV is expected to reduce drastically while scientists still race to find a permanent cure for this deadly disease.", "25928": "", "1890020305": "", "1890290113": "", "1890310216": "", "20379": "", "23950": "Although human coronavirus (HCoV)\u2010NL63 was once considered a possible causative agent of Kawasaki disease based on RT\u2010PCR analyses, subsequent studies could not confirm the result. In this study, this possibility was explored using serological tests. To evaluate the role of HCoV infection in patients with Kawasaki disease, immunofluorescence assays and virus neutralizing tests were performed. Paired serum samples were obtained from patients with Kawasaki disease who had not been treated with \u03b3\u2010globulin. HCoV\u2010NL63 and two antigenically different isolates of HCoV\u2010229E (ATCC\u2010VR740 and a new isolate, Sendai\u2010H) were examined as controls. Immunofluorescence assays detected no difference in HCoV\u2010NL63 antibody positivity between the patients with Kawasaki disease and controls, whereas the rate of HCoV\u2010229E antibody positivity was higher in the patients with Kawasaki disease than that in controls. The neutralizing tests revealed no difference in seropositivity between the acute and recovery phases of patients with Kawasaki disease for the two HCoV\u2010229Es. However, the Kawasaki disease specimens obtained from patients in recovery phase displayed significantly higher positivity for Sendai\u2010H, but not for ATCC\u2010VR740, as compared to the controls. The serological test supported no involvement of HCoV\u2010NL63 but suggested the possible involvement of HCoV\u2010229E in the development of Kawasaki disease. J. Med. Virol. 86:2146\u20132153, 2014. \u00a9 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.INTRODUCTION\nKawasaki disease is an acute febrile eruptive disease characterized by systemic vasculitis, particularly in small\u2010 and medium\u2010sized arteries. More than 80% of Kawasaki disease cases occur in children younger than 5 years, and boys are more prone to Kawasaki disease than girls [Kawasaki et al., 1974; Yanagawa et al., 1995a,b,c, 1996, 1998; Tsuchida et al., 1996].\nThough the causative agent of Kawasaki disease remains unclear, an infectious agent is thought to cause or trigger Kawasaki disease because it shows seasonal, temporal, and regional patterns [Burns et al., 2005]. Suggested Kawasaki disease pathogens include Staphylococcus [Hall et al., 1999], Streptococcus [Shinomiya et al., 1987; Kikuta et al., 1992; Anderson et al., 1995], adenovirus [Embil et al., 1985], human herpesvirus 6 [Okano et al., 1989], Epstein\u2013Barr virus [Kikuta et al., 1992], parvovirus B19 [Holm et al., 1995], human lymphotropic virus [Okano, 1999], and human bocavirus [Catalano\u2010Pons et al., 2007]; however, none of these pathogens have been confirmed to cause Kawasaki disease. Recent reports have suggested that heat shock proteins and superantigens produced by bacteria are associated with the development of Kawasaki disease [Matsubara and Fukaya, 2007; Nagata et al., 2009]. However, Rowley et al. [2005] reported that synthetic Kawasaki disease antibodies detected intracytoplasmic inclusion bodies, which were consistent with aggregates of viral proteins and nucleic acids. They also reported that the inclusion bodies seen in Kawasaki disease lesions did not have the substructure characteristic of bacterial inclusion bodies. Instead, RNA, not DNA, was present in the inclusion bodies, suggesting that an RNA virus contributes to the development of Kawasaki disease [Rowley et al., 2008; Rowley, 2011].\nHuman coronavirus (HCoV) is an enveloped RNA virus with a single, positive\u2010stranded genome of about 30\u2009kb [Wege et al., 1982; Lai and Cavanagh, 1997]. Several HCoVs have been identified as causative agents of the human common cold, including HCoV\u2010229E, HCoV\u2010OC43 (OC43), HCoV\u2010HKU1 [Woo et al., 2005], and HCoV\u2010NL63 [van der Hoek et al., 2004]. In 2005, it was reported that a new strain, HCoV\u2010NL63 [Esper et al., 2005b], was possibly associated with Kawasaki disease as parts of the spike (S) and replicase genes were detected in 8 of 11 (72.7%) respiratory specimens from patients with Kawasaki disease, as compared to 1 of 22 (4.5%) specimens from age\u2010 and region\u2010matched controls [Esper et al., 2005a]. However, many subsequent reports failed to confirm the relationship between Kawasaki disease and HCoV\u2010NL63. For example, Dominguez et al. [2006] tried to detect HCOV\u2010NL63 genes by RT\u2010PCR from nasopharyngeal\u2010wash samples, and detected it in 2 of 26 (7.7%) patients with Kawasaki disease and 4 of 52 (7.7%) matched controls. In addition, Shimizu et al. [2005] detected HCoV\u2010NL63 genes in only 1 of 48 (2%) patients with Kawasaki disease. Additionally, other reports failed to show a relationship between HCoV\u2010NL63 and Kawasaki disease [Belay et al., 2005; Ebihara et al., 2005; Chang et al., 2006; Lehmann et al., 2009].\nHCoV\u2010229E was first reported in the 1960's [Hamre and Procknow, 1966] as a common cold\u2010inducing HCoV. It is an Alphacoronavirus, similar to HCoV\u2010NL63. Dijkman et al. [2008] reported that 75% and 65% of 2.5\u2010 to 3.5\u2010year\u2010old children were HCoV\u2010NL63\u2010 and HCoV\u2010229E\u2010seropositive, respectively, and that most of the children had seroconverted to HCoVs by the age of 6. This high prevalence of seropositivity suggests that most people experience an acute HCoV infection during childhood. Therefore, HCoV is a possible causative agent of Kawasaki disease, although other factors, including genetic background, could also be involved in the development of Kawasaki disease.\nStudies of HCoV\u2010NL63 as a possible Kawasaki disease agent have focused on detecting its genes by PCR in patient specimens [Belay et al., 2005; Ebihara et al., 2005; Esper et al., 2005a; Shimizu et al., 2005; Chang et al., 2006; Dominguez et al., 2006; Lehmann et al., 2009]. To detect viral genes in specimens, sampling must be performed at a critical time; if the virus infection does not persist and the samples are collected after the infection is over, then the detection of viral genes is quite difficult. Therefore, we performed a serological study to examine the involvement of HCoV\u2010NL63 in Kawasaki disease. HCoV\u2010229E was included as a control for HCoV\u2010NL63. For the serological test, paired serum samples from patients with Kawasaki disease who had not been treated with \u03b3\u2010globulin and matched control sera were examined. The results suggested that HCoV\u2010NL63 is not a causative agent of Kawasaki disease. Instead, a particular strain of HCoV\u2010229E might trigger Kawasaki disease.MATERIALS AND METHODS\nCells and Viruses\nHeLa (HeLa\u2010229, American Tissue Culture Collection [ATCC] CCL\u20102.1) and HeLa\u2010ACE2 [Watanabe et al., 2008] cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM; Nissui, Tokyo, Japan) containing 5% fetal calf serum (FCS). BHK cells were obtained from the Health Science Research Resources Bank (Osaka, Japan). 293T/17 cells were obtained from the ATCC (CRL\u201011268). The BHK and 293T/17 cells were maintained in DMEM (D5796; Sigma, St. Louis, MO) containing 5% FCS. The ATCC strain of HCoV\u2010229E (VR740) was used (National Institute of Infectious Disease [NIID] stock, GenBank accession no. AB691763) [Shirato et al., 2012]. The clinical isolate Sendai\u2010H/1121/04 (Sendai\u2010H), which was isolated from the pharyngeal swab of an outpatient using LLC\u2010MK2 cells in 2004 in Japan, was also examined (accession no. AB691764) [Shirato et al., 2012]. Both viruses were propagated and titrated using HeLa cells, as described previously [Kawase et al., 2009; Shirato et al., 2012]. Pseudotyped vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP) (VSV\u0394G) was kindly provided by M.A. Whitt (GTx, Memphis, TN) [Takada et al., 1997]. The seed virus stock of VSV\u0394G*G, which is a VSV G protein harboring VSV\u0394G, was prepared using BHK cells, and the VSV pseudotyped with HCoV\u2010229E S protein was generated using 293T/17 cells, as described previously [Kawase et al., 2009; Shirato et al., 2012].\nClinical Specimens\nThis study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee for Human Medical Science Studies of our institute (NIID, Tokyo, Japan). Before sample collection, informed consent was obtained from the patients' parents. All clinical specimens were masked so that the investigators were blind to personal information. Fifteen pairs of serum specimens were obtained from patients with Kawasaki disease who had not been treated with \u03b3\u2010globulin at the Japanese Red Cross Medical Center (Tokyo, Japan) in the period 2001 to 2002. All Kawasaki disease cases met diagnostic criteria for Kawasaki disease and thus judged as definitive Kawasaki disease patients. There was no suspected case. Two of them showed cardiac complication, and one of them showed coronary artery ectasia in both acute and recovery phases. Other cases did not show coronary lesions. Control serum specimens collected from healthy children from 2001 to 2002 were obtained from the serum bank at the NIID. Since there was insufficient serum to perform all of the neutralizing tests, the control samples were separated randomly into two groups [group 1 (23 specimens) and group 2 (29 specimens)], and one was used for a neutralizing test with VSV\u2010pseudotyped viruses while the other was used for a neutralizing test with infectious HCoV\u2010229E. The details of the specimens are shown in Table I. No statistical difference in age and sex was detected among control serum and specimens from patients with Kawasaki disease. Serum samples from Kawasaki disease patients as well as control sera of healthy children were collected through the whole year.\nTable I.

After a 2\u2010day incubation, the cells were fixed and exposed to Kawasaki disease or control serum at a 1:200 dilution. Next, the cells were stained with FITC\u2010conjugated anti\u2010human IgG (Zymed, South San Francisco, CA). Cellular fluorescence was observed using ultraviolet fluorescence microscopy (AxioCam; Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany).\nVirus Neutralizing Test\nThe neutralizing tests were performed as described previously with modifications [Shirato et al., 2012]. Briefly, a monolayer of HeLa cells was grown in 96\u2010well (for VSV\u2010pseudotyped virus) or 24\u2010well (for infectious HCoV\u2010229E) plates. To neutralize the VSV\u2010pseudotyped virus, ca. 500 GFP count viruses were mixed with DMEM containing 5% tryptose phosphate broth (TPB) and serum (diluted 1:100). For infectious HCoV\u2010229E, ca. 100 PFU of virus were mixed with DMEM containing 5% TPB, 1% normal rabbit serum, and the specimen (diluted 1:20). Then, the samples were incubated for 60\u2009min at 4\u00b0C and inoculated onto the HeLa cell monolayers. The viruses were allowed to adsorb for 1\u2009hr at 34\u00b0C and the cells were washed three times with DMEM. Next, the infected cells were cultured with DMEM containing 5% FCS (for VSV\u2010pseudotyped virus) or 10% TPB and 1.5% carboxymethyl cellulose (for infectious HCoV\u2010229E). For the VSV\u2010pseudotyped virus, the medium was replaced with fresh phosphate\u2010buffered saline after 24\u2009hr and cell images were captured and the numbers of GFP fluorescence\u2010positive cells were counted with VH\u2010H1A5 software (Keyence, Osaka, Japan). To evaluate HCoV\u2010229E infection, cells were fixed with 20% formalin after a 2\u2010day incubation, stained with crystal violet, and the plaques were counted; 1% FCS was used as a negative control and specific anti\u2010VR740 or \u2010Sendai\u2010H rabbit serum was used as a positive control in each neutralizing test. A specimen showing more than 50% neutralization was considered positive.\nStatistical Analysis\nAn unpaired t\u2010test and Fisher's exact test were used to evaluate the significance of differences between the groups. A P\u2010value <0.05 was considered statistically significant.RESULTS\nImmunofluorescence Assays for HCoV\u2010NL63 and HCoV\u2010229E\nEsper et al. [2005a] reported that HCoV\u2010NL63 was possibly associated with Kawasaki disease based on detection of the viral genome in specimens using RT\u2010PCR; however, these observations have not been confirmed using the same method. Therefore, we examined the association of HCoV\u2010NL63 with Kawasaki disease by the serological method using Immunofluorescence assays (Fig. 1). A standard strain of HCoV\u2010229E (VR740) was used as a control for HCoV\u2010NL63. The positive and negative age\u2010 and region\u2010matched controls for the test were set for each experiment, and positivity was determined by comparison with these controls (Fig. 1a). As shown in Figure 1b, no difference in HCoV\u2010NL63 antibody positivity was detected between the patients with Kawasaki disease and controls, indicating that there was no valid association between HCoV\u2010NL63 and Kawasaki disease. This result supported the findings by several groups that reported no detection of HCoV\u2010NL\u201063 gene in Kawasaki disease specimens [Belay et al., 2005; Ebihara et al., 2005; Shimizu et al., 2005; Chang et al., 2006; Dominguez et al., 2006; Lehmann et al., 2009]. Surprisingly, HCoV\u2010229E showed higher positivity in the sera from Kawasaki disease patients, and the difference between the recovery\u2010phase and control groups was statistically significant (P\u2009<\u20090.05). This result suggests that HCoV\u2010229E, but not HCoV\u2010NL63, is related to the development of Kawasaki disease. Therefore, in a subsequent survey, focus was on HCoV\u2010229E as the causative agent of Kawasaki disease.\nFigure 1\nOpen in figure viewerPowerPoint\nImmunofluorescence assays of the Kawasaki disease specimens using cells infected with HCoV\u2010NL63 or HCoV\u2010229E (VR\u2010740). (a) Positive and negative controls for HCoV\u2010NL\u201063 (upper panels) and HCoV\u2010229E (lower panels). (b) A total of 15 paired serum samples obtained from Kawasaki disease patients and two groups of control sera (23 and 29 specimens) were used for the IFs.\nNeutralizing Tests With Sera From Patient With Kawasaki Disease\nAs described previously [Shirato et al., 2012], HCoV\u2010229E has two different serotypes: the VR740 and the Japanese clinical isolate, Sendai\u2010H. Therefore, these two viruses were used to estimate the relationship between HCoV\u2010229E and Kawasaki disease development. First, the neutralizing profiles of control specimens were analyzed (Fig. 2). For the neutralizing tests, because the concentrated serum contained a factor that non\u2010specifically blocked infection of the pseudotype virus, the sera were diluted 1:100 for the VSV\u2010pseudotyped virus and 1:20 for infectious HCoV\u2010229E. The control sera showed around 30% positivity in neutralizing tests using the VSV\u2010pseudotype viruses and about 10% positivity using infectious HCoV\u2010229E viruses; no significant difference in positivity was detected between VR\u2010740 and Sendai\u2010H. If HCoV\u2010229E were a causative agent of Kawasaki disease, then seroconversion would be detected in sera collected from the acute and recovery phases of Kawasaki disease. Thus, the levels of HCoV\u2010229E neutralizing antibodies in sera obtained from both phases in patients with Kawasaki disease was examined (Fig. 3). The study using VSV\u2010pseudotype viruses showed that the positivity for VR740 in the acute phase was 13%, while that in the recovery phase was 20%. When examined with infectious viruses, the respective values for VR740 were 13% and 27%. For Sendai\u2010H, the VSV\u2010pseudotyped virus showed that the positivity rates in the acute and recovery phases were 53% and 80%, respectively; however, while using infectious Sendai\u2010H, the respective rates were 20% and 40%. The positivity in the recovery phases seemed to be higher than that in the acute phases; however, no statistically significant difference in seropositivity was detected between them for both viruses. These results suggest that HCoV\u2010229E infection is not a direct trigger of Kawasaki disease. Even in the acute phase of Kawasaki disease, the viral infection had already subsided and antibodies were produced.\nFigure 2\nOpen in figure viewerPowerPoint\nNeutralizing tests for the control specimens.\nFigure 3\nOpen in figure viewerPowerPoint\nNeutralizing tests for the Kawasaki disease specimens.\nThe positivity against VR740 was not statistically different in Kawasaki disease specimens from that in the control groups. However, sera from recovery phase patients showed significantly higher positivity of Sendai\u2010H than those from control samples (Fig. 3). This suggests that patients with Kawasaki disease have a greater chance of being infected with Sendai\u2010H type HCoV\u2010229E than healthy control children. In other words, Kawasaki disease could be related to the infection with a particular type of HCoV\u2010229E, which may be prevalent in areas where Kawasaki disease is reported to occur.DISCUSSION\nThis study examined the involvement of HCoVs, HCoV\u2010NL63, and HCoV\u2010229E, in the development of Kawasaki disease using serological tests. Esper et al. [2005a] reported that HCoV\u2010NL63 was a possible causative agent of Kawasaki disease, but several reports have failed to confirm this [Belay et al., 2005; Ebihara et al., 2005; Shimizu et al., 2005; Chang et al., 2006; Dominguez et al., 2006; Lehmann et al., 2009]. However, most experiments examined genes derived from the virus using RT\u2010PCR. Although RT\u2010PCR has high sensitivity for detecting pathogen genes from clinical specimens, Neutralizing tests are another appropriate way to evaluate the contribution of a viral infection to the development of Kawasaki disease. However, \u03b3\u2010globulin transfers are generally used as a treatment for Kawasaki disease, and this treatment would confuse the serum antibody profile in serological tests. Therefore, the paired serum specimens obtained from Kawasaki disease patients who had not received \u03b3\u2010globulin during the disease was examined.\nSimilar to previous results, it is revealed that HCoV\u2010NL63 was not related to the development of Kawasaki disease using immunofluorescence assays. Instead, HCoV\u2010229E was suggested to be somehow related to Kawasaki disease. Therefore, the relationship between HCoV\u2010229E and Kawasaki disease was studied by using a more virus\u2010specific detection test, the neutralizing test.\nAs described previously [Shirato et al., 2012], there are at least two serotypes of HCoV\u2010229E: VR740 and Sendai\u2010H. Using these isolates as targets for the neutralizing test, the possible role of HCoV\u2010229E in patients with Kawasaki disease was evaluated. Using VR\u2010740 of HCoV\u2010229E as the antigen, higher positivity was observed by immunofluorescence assays in Kawasaki disease specimens than in controls. In contrast, higher positivity was shown in Kawasaki disease specimens in neutralizing test using Sendai\u2010H, though it was not clearly observed in VR740. Although the neutralizing antigenicity of VR\u2010740 is different from that of Sendai\u2010H [Shirato et al., 2012], VR\u2010740 and Sendai\u2010H showed some cross reactivity by immunofluorescence assays (data not shown). Therefore, it is assumed that greater positivity in Kawasaki disease specimens could be observed by immunofluorescence assays, even using Sendai\u2010H as the antigen, as compared with the results of VR\u2010740.\nIn the present study, neutralizing tests revealed that HCoV\u2010229E Sendai\u2010H showed higher seropositivity in patients with Kawasaki disease than HCoV\u2010229E VR\u2010740. Sendai\u2010H was isolated recently from a Japanese patient with a common cold and Sendai\u2010H\u2010related viruses are prevalent currently among patients from Japan and other countries [Chibo and Birch, 2006; Shirato et al., 2012]. In contrast, VR\u2010740, an initial strain isolated in the 1960s [Hamre and Procknow, 1966], is not prevalent currently in Australia and Japan [Chibo and Birch, 2006; Shirato et al., 2012]. These facts are in good agreement with the finding that a recent case of Kawasaki disease examined in this study was related to HCoV\u2010229E Sendai\u2010H rather than VR740. Moreover, a mild cold is known to precede the onset of Kawasaki disease and, thus, the agent that causes this respiratory disease could be a good candidate to trigger Kawasaki disease. The present study suggests that HCoV\u2010229E could be one possible candidate. To test this hypothesis, a large\u2010scale serological surveillance of Kawasaki disease, before and after onset, is required.\nSome studies reported the activation of peripheral blood B cells and polyclonal B cell activation in acute Kawasaki disease [Leung et al., 1982, 1987; Furukawa et al., 1991, 1992; Nonoyama, 1991]. It is also suggested that new endothelial cell antigens induced by cytokine production, and generation of autoantibodies directed to these antigen caused the endothelial cell injury in Kawasaki disease [Leung, 1991]. However, in this study, there is no increase in antibody for HCoV\u2010NL63 even if polyclonal B cell activation occurred, suggesting that our results would not result from such polyclonal B cell activation.\nIf HCoV\u2010229E Sendai\u2010H were a causative triggering agent for Kawasaki disease, then a significant increase in seropositivity from acute to recovery phase would be anticipated; however, the results in the present study do not support this theory. One possible explanation for this result is that the virus infection has already subsided when Kawasaki disease is first apparent in patients, and that the antibody against HCoV\u2010229E is already present even in the acute phase of Kawasaki disease. In the recovery phase, a slight increase in positivity may occur, although such an increase was not statistically significant in our study. Alternatively, many cases of Kawasaki disease examined in the present study may not seem serious. Serious cases are normally treated with \u03b3\u2010globulin transfer in about 80% of patients with Kawasaki disease in Japan [Yanagawa et al., 1995d]. Virus infection may not have been intense in patients with Kawasaki disease and, thus, the antibody response was low. Future studies would be facilitated by the availability of sera from normal individuals before Kawasaki disease onset and before \u03b3\u2010globulin treatment after Kawasaki disease onset. Such cohort studies would be invaluable in determining whether HCoV is the Kawasaki disease triggering agent.\nIn addition, it is thought that common cold caused by HCoVs generally shows winter seasonality, however, Gaunt et al. [2010] reported that HCoV\u2010229E detected sporadically through the year, though epidemiological surveillance studies for HCoVs are very limited. On the other hand, it is reported that Kawasaki disease cases increase in summer and winter [Burns et al., 2005]. Therefore, it makes sense to postulate that HCoV\u2010229E is a possible causative agent for Kawasaki disease if HCoV\u2010229E infection occurs through the year, though it is very likely that some environmental and genetic factors, in addition to virus infection, considerably influence the development of Kawasaki disease.ACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nWe thank Dr. Tomisaku Kawasaki for his invaluable suggestions and many helpful discussions.

It includes critical cases with early neonatal infection.9 Even though the pediatric patients account for a lower proportion (0.35%, below 10 years old),10 we should give importance to early diagnosis and treatment.\nTo our knowledge, many studies have been conducted to describe the clinical manifestations in children and adults. Nevertheless, no study is available that compares the clinical features of children with confirmed 2019\u2010nCoV infection to those of infected adults. In this regard, the purpose of our retrospective study is to analyze the clinical manifestations of confirmed n\u2010CoV infection in children and adults. Furthermore, we compared all the parameters between these two groups, which will assist the practitioners to explore the possible causes of the discrepant aspects and lead to an accurate diagnosis and efficient treatment.2 METHODS\n2.1 Patients\nWe retrospectively reviewed records of 32 cases confirmed with 2019\u2010nCoV acute respiratory disease (2019\u2010nCoV ARD), who were managed at Xian eighth hospital (Shaanxi, China) from 31st January to 16th February 2020. Cases were confirmed by clinical and epidemiological evidence, and approximately 93.8% (30/32) of them were also laboratory\u2010confirmed. Diagnosis and the severity of 2019\u2010nCoV ARD was defined according to National Recommendations for Diagnosis and Treatment of pneumonia caused by 2019\u2010nCoV (5th edition)11. Patients less than 18 years were grouped as children/pediatric patients, while those \u226518 years as adults. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants enrolled in the study, including children under 18 years old, whose consent was provided by their parents or guardians.\n2.2 Data collection\nClinical data including epidemiological, demographical, clinical symptoms, laboratory measurements, imaging findings, management, and outcome were recorded. The incubation period is the duration from the exposure of the pathogen to the onset of symptoms. All patients underwent imaging examination on admission. Discharge criteria includes body temperature returning to normal for a minimum of 3 days, significant improvement in respiratory symptoms and completion of two consecutive negative tests of respiratory pathogenic nucleic acid (sampling interval of at least 1 day).12\nThroat swab specimens from the upper respiratory tract were collected from all patients at admission and stored in a viral transport medium. The presence of 2019\u2010nCoV virus nucleic acid was detected using real\u2010time reverse transcription\u2010polymerase chain reaction through the Shaanxi Center for Disease Control and Prevention.\n2.3 Statistical analysis\nAll statistical data were processed using IBM SPSS 19.0 statistical software. Continuous variables were expressed as the means and standard deviations or medians and range (min to max) as appropriate. t test or Wilcoxon rank\u2010sum tests were applied to continuous variables, while \u03c72 tests or Fisher's exact tests were used to compare categorical variable as appropriate. P\u2009<\u2009.05 was considered statistically significant.3 RESULTS\n3.1 Baseline characteristics\nA total of 32 cases with 2019\u00adnCoV infection were reported in this study, including 7 children and 25 adults. The children group (below 18 years old) comprised three girls and four boys, with the mean age of 1.3 years (ranged, 2 months\u201013 years). The adult group included 12 men and 13 women, with the mean age of 44 years (ranged, 22\u201070 years).\nAs shown in Table 1, there was no significant difference in gender distribution between the two groups. All children were family clusters or had a clear history of close contact with 2019\u2010nCoV\u2010confirmed patients. In adult patients,14 (56%) patients were local residents of Wuhan, 10 (40%) patients recently travelled to Wuhan, and only 1 (4%) patient had a close contact with individuals from Wuhan. None of the patients had a history of contact with wildlife. The median incubation period of children and adult was 5 days (ranged, 3\u201012 days) and 4 days (ranged, 2\u201012 days), respectively; which indicated no statistical significance (P\u2009=\u2009.408). Altogether 10 adult patients had an underlying comorbidity; especially diabetes (9%, 36%) and hypertension (7%, 28%), which was absent in pediatric population.\nTable 1.

Diarrhoea, vomiting, and pharyngalgia were also recorded (Table 1). Furthermore, it is worth mentioning that children suffered more frequently from diarrhoea and/or vomiting with a statistically significant difference (57.1% vs 8%, P=.012), whereas in adults myalgia or fatigue were observed more frequently with no significant difference (52% vs 0, P\u2009=\u2009.25). There was no difference in upper limit of body temperature between the two groups (38.24\u2009\u00b1\u20091.10\u00b0C vs 38.18\u2009\u00b1\u20090.62, P=.958). The median duration of fever was 1 day (ranged, 0\u20103 days) in the pediatric group, and 4 days (ranged, 1\u201010 days) in the adult group (P\u2009=\u2009.011).\n3.3 Radiological and laboratory findings\nA number of 71.4% of children and 80% of adults showed positive findings suggestive of pneumonia, on chest X\u2010ray and computed tomography (Table 2). The two groups shared a multitude of common imaging findings including ground\u2010glass opacity and segmental consolidation in bilateral lung fields, especially in the peripheral zones. Figure 1 demonstrates the radiological findings in pediatric and adult patients with 2019\u2010nCoV ARD. It showed no prominent differences in severity of radiologic abnormalities. However, 28.6% of the affected children and 20% of adult cases did not have any significant radiological findings (P\u2009=\u2009.632).

D, shows mild pneumonia of a 1 year and 4 months old girl, who had fever, cough, and diarrhoea on admission and was diagnosed as mild type. CT scans, computed tomography scans\nThe analysis of laboratory parameters revealed leucopenia (leucocyte count <3500/mL) as a common finding among adults (20%) while leukocytosis being more frequent in children (28.6%) (P=.014) (Table 2). Laboratory reports showed thrombocytopenia in 8% (2 adults) of the adult patients and thrombocytosis in another 8% adults. In children, the corresponding values were 0% and, 14.3% respectively. Hypoalbuminemia was observed in 18 patients and different degrees of renal function damage was revealed in 20 cases, all of whom were from the adult group (P\u2009=\u2009.001 and .025, respectively). Moreover, four children and six adult patients had differing degrees of liver function abnormality, with increased alanine aminotransferase or aspartate aminotransferase. Most of the children had elevated creatine kinase isoenzyme compared to adults (P\u2009=\u2009.004). All other myocardial damage indexes such as lactate dehydrogenase, myoglobin and brain natriuretic peptide showed no distinct difference in two groups. More adults suffered from coagulation disorder (child/adult, 71.4% vs 88%; P\u2009=\u2009.296), especially increased activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT, P\u2009=\u2009.003) and fibrinogen (P\u2009=\u2009.049). Regarding the infection\u2010related biomarkers, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR, child/adult: 42.9% vs 84%, P\u2009=\u2009.047) and procalcitonin (PCT, child/adult:42.9% vs 0, P\u2009=\u2009.007) were elevated prominently in adult and children, respectively (Table 3).\nTable 3.

They recovered within 1 to 2 weeks with prompt symptomatic treatment. Two children developed shortness of breath and received oxygen therapy; an infant had bilateral pneumonia for which low\u2010dose glucocorticoids were injected intravenously to prevent the progression. In adult group, four patients suffered from severe pneumonia; while in others mild severity was noticed. Similarly, 12 of the adult patients required oxygen inhalation. Antiviral therapy was given to all adult patients but to none of the children. In the adult group, empirical antibiotic treatment was initiated in eight cases at the same time. No death was reported in either group, and the rate of discharge from the hospital was 100%.4 DISCUSSION\nSince the beginning of 2019\u00adnCoV pandemic, the infection rate of children is relatively lower. The previous published data reports the age group of 30 to 69 years old accounting for 77.8% of the entire case load; our study further confirms the fact that n\u2010CoV affects primarily the adults.8 Similar characteristics have been reported in the infection of SARS\u2010related coronavirus and MERS coronavirus. A previous study concludes that lower risk of exposure, incomplete diagnosis, presence of mild symptoms or asymptomatic disease in the unaffected age group, may be a reason for one particular age group appearing to be more susceptible. The presence of resistance to infection by the unaffected age group is out of question.13 Our study shows that the presentation of symptoms in all of the seven children started after a confirmed diagnosis in one of the family members, whereas in adults the routes of infection were diverse. Another reason for children appearing to be protected is the presence of comorbidities like diabetes, hypertension, coronary artery disease etc, in more than 50% of the adults affected with n\u2010CoV, which makes adult population more susceptible to the n\u2010Coronavirus infection.14, 15\nConsistent with recent publications,1, 10, 13-17 fever and cough were the dominant symptoms in both children and adults. It was noted that adult patients rarely developed intestinal signs and symptoms (eg diarrhoea and/or vomiting), whereas about 57.1% of children patients had diarrhoea. Another study, at prestigious Wuhan hospital, focusing on the gastrointestinal symptoms of n\u2010CoV pneumonia, demonstrated that 49.5% of patients had diarrhoea.18 A longer observation period in following hospitalization may increase the ratio of gastrointestinal symptoms and demonstrate a different result, whereas in our study those were observed at an early time point. Zhou et al found that 2019 n\u2010CoV uses the same cell entry receptor, angiotensin convertase enzyme (ACE2), as SARS\u2010CoV3. ACE2 is not only expressed in respiratory organs, but also in the digestive system.19 Some scholars speculate that 2019\u2010nCoV may interact with ACE2 receptor in gastrointestinal tract, impair the intestinal mucous membrane barrier and increase the inflammatory cytokines production.20 Therefore, whether a higher rate of gastrointestinal symptoms in children group is related to higher expression of ACE2 in gastrointestinal tract or different functions of ACE2 remains to be confirmed by further research. Similarly, duration of fever in adult was longer than children. This was due, at least in part, to differences in immune responses, especially specific immune response. Adults seemed more susceptible to a harmful immune response.\nIn laboratory tests, we found that children had different laboratory parameters than adults. It was observed that white blood count was frequently elevated among children contrary to adults, majority of which showed leucopenia. The recent report on the absolute value of lymphocytes showed either normal or reduced numbers in majority of the adults.14, 16 It may be due to dissimilar immune response of different individuals to n\u2010CoV. We also observed that abnormal coagulation function, hypoalbuminemia, and hypouricemia were more common in adult patients which might be associated with presence of underlying disease in the adults. Myocardial zymography revealed, elevated levels of creatine kinase isoenzyme, higher in children than in adults. This may be explained by intense chills associated with high fever or by the higher incidence of myocardial damage in children.\nAs 2019\u2010nCoV is an emerging virus, there are currently no effective vaccines or antiviral drugs. Experts consensus (the fourth edition) listed IFN\u2010\u03b1 nebulization as a treatment of choice for 2019\u2010nCoV pneumonia.21 The combination of Lopinavir and Ritonavir is another recommended antivirus regimen.11 Lopinavir and Ritonavir are anti\u2010human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) protease inhibitor, which are also used to treat HIV\u20101 in adults and children above 14 days of age.22 That fewer adverse clinical outcomes were reported among SARS\u2010CoV patients revealed that lopinavir/ritonavir benefited the patients in clinical practice substantially.23 None of the 32 patients required intensive care or mechanical ventilation or had any severe complications. Because of the limited number of subjects in this study, it is difficult to compare the clinical outcomes related to treatment between the two groups. More effort should be made to elaborate on this issue in future research.\nThe limitation of this study is its small sample size. In addition, the sampling site to detect viral nucleic acid sequences was limited, which could lead to false positive or false negative into the study. Research recommends strict medical quarantine and observation for all patients with suspected disease until the results of nucleic acid amplification tests from throat swabs, sputum, and even lung lavage are obtained.24, 25 In our study, diagnosis relies on the integration of epidemiology, clinical manifestations, laboratory and radiographic examinations, and viral nucleic acid detection, as such, we believe that the physician reported diagnosis is credible. Finally, the 2019\u2010nCoV evaluation was qualitative so that quantitative virus titer was not obtained to provide more information to compared the difference between the children and adults in details.\nIn conclusion, our multi\u2010dimensional study demonstrates that children with 2019\u2010nCoV infection present a clinical picture which is often distinct from that of adults. Knowledge of these differences will be helpful for the clinical diagnosis of 2019\u2010nCoV disease and for a future discussion on age\u2010specific coronavirus infection.ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nWe would like to gratefully thank all the patients, their family members for their selfless participation, and to Xian Eighth Hospital, Xi'an, China, for providing experimental resources.

An assent was taken from children under 18 years of age while informed consent was provided by their parents or guardians.", "23465": "INTRODUCTION\nHuman coronavirus (HCoV) 229E and HCoV\u2010OC43 account for 5\u201330% of cases of acute respiratory tract infection [McIntosh et al., 1969]. HCoV\u2010NL63 was discovered in 2004 as a minor pathogen of HCoV infections in humans [van der Hoek et al., 2004]. A new human coronavirus\u2010HKU1 (HCoV\u2010HKU1) has been reported from a patient with pneumonia in Hong Kong. This species was classified into family Coronaviridae, genus Betacoronavirus, and further as a lineage A [Woo et al., 2005c].\nThe genome contains the genes for replicase polyproteins 1a/1b (pp1a/1b), hemagglutinin esterase (HE), spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N) in the same order as in other members of the genus Betacoronavirus [Pyrc et al., 2007; Woo et al., 2009]. HCoV is associated frequently with community acquired upper respiratory tract infections showing typical clinical symptoms including a runny nose, fever, coughing, and wheezing [Labret et al., 2005; Esper et al., 2006; Gose et al., 2011]. However, other disease manifestations including bronchiolitis and pneumonia can occur [Bosis et al., 2007; Gerna et al., 2007; Vabret et al., 2007]. The respiratory symptoms of HCoV\u2010HKU1 infection are usually similar to infections with other HCoVs, but HCoV\u2010HKU1 can cause death in elderly people [Ren et al., 2011] and upper and lower respiratory tract infections in children [Woo et al., 2005b; Jin et al., 2012].\nIn this study, a Taq\u2010Man\u00ae\u2010based real\u2010time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method that targets the HCoV\u2010HKU1 open reading frame (ORF) 1a and ORF 1b genes with high sensitivity and specificity was developed and evaluated. Sequence information for the RdRp, S, and N genes of HCoV\u2010HKU1 was also analyzed to classify the genotype prevalence of the virus in Korea [Woo et al., 2005a; Woo et al., 2006]. This study is the first to identify and classify the genotypic predisposition of HCoV\u2010HKU1 as a causative agent of acute respiratory illness in Korea.MATERIALS AND METHODS\nClinical Specimens\nThroat swab specimens were collected from patients with an acute respiratory illness. Enrollment of 1,985 patients was performed under the acute respiratory tract infection surveillance (ARI\u2010Net) program in the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) from January 2007 to May 2008. All clinical specimens were collected under regulation of Korea National Institute of Health institutional review boards (IRBs) and written informed consents were obtained from patients or their parent/guardian.\nReal\u2010Time PCR Assay for HCoV\u2010HKU1\nTo design primer and probes for real\u2010time PCR, full genome sequence of HCoV\u2010HKU1 was retrieved from GenBank accession no. NC006577. HCoV\u2010HKU1 ORF 1a and ORF 1b gene were analyzed using Primer Express software version 2.0 (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) to allocate target sites which could be used as primers and probes. Total RNAs from 140\u2009\u00b5l of clinical specimens were extracted using QIAamp viral RNA mini kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) and directly used as templates. cDNA synthesis was performed using random primers and murine mammal leukemia virus (M\u2010MLV) reverse transcriptase (Promega, Madison, WI) in accordance with manufacturer's instruction. Real\u2010time PCR assays targeting the ORF 1a and ORF 1b sequences were performed using 10\u2009\u00b5l aliquots of mixtures containing 1\u2009\u00b5l cDNA or a standard plasmid, 5\u2009\u00b5l Taq\u2010Man\u00ae universal PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) containing ROX as a passive reference dye, 900\u2009nM of forward and reverse primers and 250\u2009nM of probe (Table I). Amplification and detection were performed using an ABI PRISM 7900HT sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems) under the following conditions: uracil\u2010N\u2010glycosylase was activated at 50\u00b0C for 2\u2009min, Taq polymerase was activated at 95\u00b0C for 10\u2009min and 40 cycles of amplification (95\u00b0C for 15\u2009sec, 60\u00b0C for 1\u2009min) were run [Choi et al., 2008; Lu et al., 2008]. Positive values were decided when the copy number exceeded 10\u2009copies/\u00b5l and the two target genes (ORF 1a and ORF 1b) were detected simultaneously. The viral load was calculated and determined from mean threshold cycle (Ct) values of specimens and a standard curve prepared from a known concentration of the DNA encoding the RdRp gene. All quantification experiments were performed using triple repetitions.\nTable I.

Regression analysis was performed with 95% confidential level to identify relationship between HCoV\u2010HKU1 infection and clinical symptoms using the SAS program (version 9.2).\nReverse Transcription (RT)\u2010PCR and Sequencing of RdRp, S, and N Genes of HCoV\u2010HKU1 and Phylogenetic Analysis\nThe RdRp, S, and N genes of HCoV\u2010HKU1 were amplified by RT\u2010PCR with specific primers (Table II). cDNA synthesis was performed as described above using M\u2010MLV reverse transcriptase (Promega). The PCR assays were performed in a 50\u2009\u00b5l reaction volumes containing 5\u2009\u00b5l cDNA, 5\u2009\u00b5l 10\u2009\u00d7\u2009PCRbuffer, 2\u2009\u00b5l dNTPmix (final concentration of 400\u2009mM of each dNTP), 1\u2009\u00b5l SP Taq (Cosmo Gentech, Seoul, Korea), 1\u2009\u00b5l of each primer (10\u2009pM), and nuclease\u2010free water to 50\u2009\u00b5l. The PCR reaction was carried out at 94\u00b0C for 3\u2009min, 35 cycles of amplification (30\u2009sec at 94\u00b0C; 30\u2009sec at 48\u00b0C for RdRp, 58\u00b0C for S, 56\u00b0C for N; 30\u2009sec at 72\u00b0C), and a final extension step at 72\u00b0C for 10\u2009min. The PCR products were run on a 2% agarose gel, stained with SYBR safe DNA gel stain dye (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and visualized under UV light. Sequencing reactions were performed using BigDye\u00ae Terminators version 3.1 Cycle Sequencing Kits (Applied Biosystems) using the manufacturer's instructions on a DNA analyzer (model 3730, Applied Biosystems). Phylogenetic tree construction was performed using the MEGA4 program (http://www.megasoftware.net/) using the neighbor\u2010joining method with Clustal W, and bootstrap values calculated from 500 trees.\nTable II.

Tenfold serial dilutions of the standard HCoV\u2010HKU1 plasmid DNA ranging from 1 to 1\u2009\u00d7\u20091010\u2009copies/\u00b5l were used as templates for comparing the sensitivity between real\u2010time PCR and conventional PCR. The detection limit of real\u2010time PCR assays was as low as 10\u2009copies/\u00b5l. The sensitivity of the real\u2010time PCR assays used in this study was 1\u2009\u00d7\u2009105 times higher than conventional PCR (Fig. 1). Cross reactivity was also evaluated with cDNA of influenza viruses A/B, parainfluenza viruses 1/2/3, respiratory syncytial virus, human rhinovirus and enterovirus, DNA of adenovirus, human bocavirus, and respiratory pathogenic bacteria (Haemophilus influenzae, Legionella spp., Streptococcus pneumoniae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and Chlamydophila pneumoniae). No non\u2010specific amplification was detected in either assay system (data not shown).\nFigure 1\nOpen in figure viewerPowerPoint\nComparison of the sensitivity of the real\u2010time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay for the human coronavirus HKU1 (HCoV\u2010HKU1) ORF 1b gene with conventional PCR. The RT\u2010PCR assay detected up to 10\u2009copies/\u00b5l of standard DNA, whereas the detection limit of conventional PCR was 1\u2009\u00d7\u2009106\u2009copies/\u00b5l.\nDetection and Clinical Characteristics of HCoV\u2010HKU1 Infection\nFifty HCoV\u2010HKU1\u2010positive cases were detected (2.5%) out of 1,985 clinical specimens using real\u2010time PCR assays targeting ORF 1a and ORF 1b. The amount of RNA detected in positive specimens ranged from 6.7\u2009\u00d7\u2009104 to 1.6\u2009\u00d7\u2009109\u2009copies/ml. Based on analysis of multiple alternative clinical records, rhinorrhea (72% of patients), cough (64%), and nasal congestion (56%) were the major symptoms of patients infected with HCoV\u2010HKU1. The other basic respiratory symptoms were fever (32%), sputum discharge (30%), sore throat (18%), chills (16%), postnasal discharge (14%), and tonsillar hypertrophy (10%; Table III). There were no positive cases associated with severe respiratory symptoms such as pneumonia and bronchiolitis. Seasonal distribution of HCoV\u2010HKU1 infection was found, with the main prevalence from early winter to late spring with an 8% mean positive rate (Fig. 2).\nTable III.

Eight cases were HCoV\u2010HKU1 genotype B (73%) and three were HCoV\u2010HKU1 genotype A (27%) when queried through a public database [Benson et al., 2005]. Phylogenetic analysis also indicated that HCoV\u2010HKU1 isolates in this study consisted of genotypes A and B, whereas genotype C was not identified (Fig. 3).\nFigure 3\nOpen in figure viewerPowerPoint\nPhylogenetic analysis of the RdRp, S, and N genes of HCoV\u2010HKU1. Eleven positive cases were classed as genotype A (n\u2009=\u20093) or B (n\u2009=\u20098). There was no HCoV\u2010HKU1 genotype C detected in Korea during the study period. Each shadowed number indicates the specimen identification number, and reference sequences are marked as GenBank accession numbers. Phylogenetic trees are shown of (A) the RdRp gene (897 neucleotide (nt)), (B) the S gene (309\u2009nt), and (C) the N gene (425\u2009nt). Primer sequences were excluded from phylogenetic analysis.DISCUSSION\nSince HCoV\u2010HKU1 was first identified in a patient with pneumonia in Hong Kong, clinical manifestations and epidemiological features of infection with this virus have been reported from several countries [Labret et al., 2005; Esper et al., 2006; Gose et al., 2011]. Chung et al. [2007] also tried to identify the virus in patients with acute expiratory wheezing in Korea but evidence of HCoV\u2010HKU1 infection was not found. These negative results arose from several limitations such as an insensitive diagnostic strategy, selection of samples out of season as well as the relatively small number of patients studied. To circumvent these limitations, a quantitative real\u2010time PCR was developed and targeted a study group of 1,985 throat swab specimens collected from patients with an acute respiratory illness from January 2007 to May 2008.\nThe aim of the real\u2010time PCR assays developed in this study was to detect both of the HCoV\u2010HKU1 ORF 1a and ORF 1b genes. The assays provided enhanced sensitivity and specificity, which could permit quantitative analysis of HCoV\u2010HKU1 in clinical specimens. The ORF 1b assay gave more dynamic Ct values than the ORF 1a assay. Therefore, the ORF 1b assay could be more applicable for clinical diagnosis using respiratory specimens from patients with acute respiratory tract infections caused by HCoV\u2010HKU1.\nIn this study, HCoV\u2010HKU1 was found in 2.5% of patients (50 cases) with acute respiratory illness sampled from January 2007 to May 2008 in Korea. A similar incidence was reported previously in Hong Kong [Woo et al., 2009] and China [Jin et al., 2010] but an apparently higher rate was noted in Chinese study because of different clinical practices. Unlikely, apparent lower incidence (0.3%, n\u2009=\u20094,181) of HCoV\u2010HKU1 in patients with acute respiratory tract in Hong Kong was reported by Lau et al. [2006]. Relatively high incidence of HCoV\u2010HKU1 in Korea might have resulted from difference of target study group and/or sensitivity of detection strategy. Even though the quantified viral loads varied from 6.7\u2009\u00d7\u2009104 to 1.6\u2009\u00d7\u2009109\u2009copies/ml in the respiratory disease specimens used, there were no significant correlations between viral load and specific clinical features. Similarly, there were no statistically significant relationships between the HCoV\u2010HKU1 infection and any particular clinical symptoms. As for seasonal prevalence, the HCoV\u2010HKU1 infections prevailed in the winter and spring in Korea and this result was consistent with the infection rates of HCoV\u2010OC43, 229E and with other reports [Lau et al., 2006; Domiquez et al., 2009; Gaunt et al., 2010]. One limitation of this study was that because clinical specimens were chosen from negative cases of acute respiratory illness in the ARI\u2010Net laboratory surveillance system [Chun et al., 2009], dual or multiple infections of HCoV\u2010HKU1 with other respiratory viruses could not be detected.\nTo identify whether there was any recombinant HCoV\u2010HKU1 isolated from Korean patients, the nucleotide sequence information of the RdRp, S, and N genes was analyzed. Similar to previous study reported by Lau et al. [2006] in Hong Kong, our phylogenetic analysis revealed that 11 cases of HCoV\u2010HKU1 isolated in Korea comprised two genotypes: A or B. When single reciprocal nucleotide exchanges were analyzed between the RdRp, S, and N genes, no recombination could be identified. Instead, several point mutations were observed at the nucleotide level, resulting in a transition (C to T) or a transversion (C to T or T to C) in the RdRp, S, and N genes. However, these were silent mutations so that no changes occurred at the amino acid level. Interestingly, a silent continuous mutation in the N gene was identified from 6/8 isolates of HCoV\u2010HKU1 genotype B. Thus, there might have been a unique strain of HCoV\u2010HKU1 prevailing in Korea at that time.\nThis is the first report that HCoV\u2010HKU1 was associated with acute respiratory illness in Korea. Infections with HCoV\u2010HKU1 peaked from winter through to spring in Korea during 2007\u20132008. Sequencing and phylogenetic analysis revealed that the 11 HCoV\u2010HKU1 isolates belonged to two distinct genotypes A and B based on the RdRp, S, and N genes. Unlike a previous study, no gene recombination was identified in HCoV\u2010HKU1. Instead, a conserved silent mutation was observed in the N gene of the putative Korean strain of HCoV\u2010HKU1 genotype B from six specimens. Intensive molecular epidemiological investigations would be required to elucidate any possible changes in viral tropism caused by such mutations.Acknowledgements\nAuthors are grateful to Mr. H.D. Cheong for excellent statistical analysis of clinical symptoms.", "20288": "", "25865": "1 INTRODUCTION\nIn December 2019, a novel pulmonary cluster infection was found in Wuhan, China.1 The infected person developed fever, dry cough, dyspnea, gastrointestinal upset, and other severe respiratory syndromes.2, 3 It was caused by a novel coronavirus infection, and the pathogen was named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS\u2010CoV\u20102).4 SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 can be transmitted through saliva, droplets or close contact, and many of its biological characteristics are currently unknown.2, 5 Until March 17, 2020, globally, the World Health Organization announced that there were over 179\u2009112 cases of infection including 7426 deaths.6\nBoth SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 1 (SARS\u2010CoV\u20101) can cause severe respiratory syndrome. The SARS\u2010CoV\u20101 epidemic infection occurred in 2003, and then quickly spread to many regions around the world, causing global public health crisis with strong infectiousness and high mortality.7, 8 SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 and SARS\u2010CoV\u20101 have similarities in structure and bioinformatics, but their homology at the genome level is less than 80%.9 Some studies have shown that intermediate hosts may be wild animals such as pangolins,10, 11 and then humans can be infected. The spike protein on the surface of the coronavirus plays a key role in the process of invading cells. Compared with SARS\u2010CoV\u20101, an important variation of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 is the introduction of a furin protease site in the spike protein.12, 13 It greatly increases the infection efficiency of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102. With the analysis of the spike protein structure of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 by cryoelectron microscopy, it was found that SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 had stronger binding ability to ACE2 than SARS\u2010CoV\u20101,14 and the serum cross\u2010reactivity between SARS\u2010CoV\u20101 and SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 is still unknown. Since there are currently no drugs and vaccines that inhibit these viral infections, it is necessary to establish effective systems to assess their effectiveness.\nBoth SARS\u2010CoV\u20101 and SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 induce highly pathogenic infectious diseases, which need to be operated in a biosafety level 3 (BSL\u20103) laboratory for biosafety consideration. In this study, SARS\u2010CoV spike protein coated pseudoviral particles (saCoV2pp) were established, which have similar infection characteristics to the virus but no amplification ability. saCoV2pp were used to infect cells derived from different tissues and animal species to evaluate its infective characterization and was successfully used to evaluate neutralizing antibodies in serum.2 MATERIALS AND METHODS\n2.1 Cells\nThe Huh7.5 cell line was a gift from the laboratory of Charles M. Rice; RH35 was obtained from the Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences; immortalized tree shrew liver cells X9.0 and X9.5 and monkey liver cells RHT6.0 were isolated by our laboratory; Vero, A357, Caco\u20102, KMB17, Hep2, Hacat, NIH3T3, CHO\u2010K1, HEK293, HEK293T, HL7702, HepG2, Hep1\u20106, and Huh7 cells were preserved by our laboratory. All the cells were cultured at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO2 in flasks with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM), 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Gibco), penicillin, and streptomycin.\n2.2 Transfection and Western blot to detect spike protein expression\nWe transfected plasmids encoding wild\u2010type or codon\u2010optimized SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 spike protein into HEK293T cells using jetPRIME transfection reagent. Cells were incubated for 4\u2009hours at 37\u00b0C with transfection medium. Then, the transfection medium was replaced with DMEM containing 10% FBS, and the supernatant was removed after 48\u2009hours. The cells were lysed with radioimmunoprecipitation assay, at 10\u2009\u00b5g/well; samples were analyzed by 8% sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes by the Trans\u2010Blot TurboTM Transfer System (Bio\u2010Rad). The membrane was blocked with 5% nonfat milk for 1\u2009hour at room temperature and incubated with the primary antibody (cat: 40150\u2010T52; Sino Biological) (1:1000 dilution) for 1\u2009hour at room temperature and washed five times with tris\u2010buffered saline with Tween 20 (TBST) buffer. The goat anti\u2010rabbit secondary antibody (1:5000 dilution) was incubated at room temperature for 1\u2009hour and washed five times with TBST buffer. Finally, signals were visualized using Western Detection Reagent (GE Healthcare).\n2.3 Pseudoviral particle production\nHEK293T cells were cotransfected with the spike protein\u2010encoding or spike protein knock\u2010out transmembrane domain (S\u0394TM) plasmid and the lentiviral expression vector carrying the luciferase reporter gene using Lipofectamine 3000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Cells were incubated for 6\u2009hours at 37\u00b0C with transfection medium, and then the transfection medium was replaced with DMEM containing 10% FBS. The cell supernatant was harvested after 48\u2009hours, centrifuged at 4000\u2009rpm for 15\u2009minutes to remove impurities such as cell debris, and then stored at \u221280\u00b0C.\n2.4 Pseudoviral particle infection and luciferase activity measurements\nThe cells were plated into a 48\u2010well plate at a density 2\u2009\u00d7\u2009104 cells/well for 20\u2009hours, the pseudovirus was removed from \u221280\u00b0C refrigeration, rapidly melted in a 37\u00b0C water bath, and then placed on ice, mixed with DMEM containing 2% FBS at a ratio of 1:1; then, the medium was removed from the cells, 200\u2009\u00b5L of the pseudovirus mixture was added, and the cells were incubated at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO2 for 48\u2009hours. The supernatant was removed, the cells were washed with 200\u2009\u00b5L phosphate\u2010buffered saline (PBS), and 40\u2009\u00b5L of lysate was lysed (Promega E1531) for 2 to 3\u2009minutes. The lysate was removed into a tube and centrifuged at 5000\u2009rpm for 5\u2009minutes. The precipitate was wiped off, and the supernatant and substrate (Promega E1501) were mixed in a 1:10 ratio. Fluoroskan Ascent FL (Thermo Fisher Scientific) was used to measure the luciferase activity. The values were multiplied by a scaling factor of 106.\n2.5 Neutralization antibody detection\nHuh7.5 cells were plated in 96\u2010well plates at a density of 1\u2009\u00d7\u2009104 cells/well for 20\u2009hours. The serum was inactivated at 56\u00b0C for 30\u2009minutes, 50\u2009\u00b5L serum was mixed with 200\u2009\u00b5L pseudovirus (~200\u2009ng p24/mL), and diluted twice using the pseudovirus, making the serum and pseudovirus ratios reach 1:256. Then, the cells were incubated at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO2 for 1\u2009hour. The medium was removed from Huh7.5 cells, 50\u2009\u00b5L of medium containing 2% FBS was added. Then, adding 50\u2009\u00b5L neutralized the virus and serum mixture, which was mixed with gentle shaking, incubated at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO2 in an incubator for 48\u2009hours. The supernatant was removed, the cells were washed with PBS, and 20\u2009\u00b5L lysate was lysed (Promega E1531) for 2 to 3\u2009minutes, then centrifuged at 12\u2009000\u2009rpm for 5\u2009minutes. The supernatant and substrate (Promega E1501) were mixed at a 1:10 ratio. A Fluoroskan Ascent FL (Thermo Fisher Scientific) was used to measure the luciferase activity. The values were multiplied by a scaling factor of 106.\n2.6 Statistical analysis\nData were analyzed by one\u2010way or two\u2010way analysis of variance followed by Brown\u2013Forsythe test or Bartlett's test where appropriate. At least three independent experiments were carried out, and the data from each experiment were expressed as the mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD. P\u2009<\u2009.05 was considered significant.3 RESULTS\n3.1 Analysis of infectivity of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 pseudoviral particles on the main human vaccine\u2010producing cells\nAccording to the SARS\u2010CoV\u20101 and SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 genome sequences, the entire wild\u2010type and codon\u2010optimized spike gene sequences were synthesized and inserted into a mammalian cell expression plasmid. After transfection and expression in HEK293T cells, the S protein expression level was measured by Western blot analysis. The S protein expression level coded by the original gene sequence was low. However, codon optimization significantly increased the expression level (Figure 1). This codon\u2010optimized gene with the lentiviral expression vector carrying the luciferase reporter gene was cotransfected into HEK293T cells, and the supernatant was collected to infect fresh cells. Significant luciferase reporter gene activity in infected cells than that in the control cells (Figure 2). To find suitable cell strains for the amplification of the SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 virus for the development of inactivated vaccines. The study tested saCoV2pp on diploid cells (KMB17), green monkey kidney cells (Vero), human embryonic kidney cells (HEK293), and hamster ovary cells (CHO\u2010K1); mouse embryo fibroblast cells (NIH3T3) that lack transmembrane regions (S\u0394TM) were used as a negative control, and SARS\u2010CoV\u20101 pseudoviral particles (saCoV1pp) were used as a positive control. The infection results suggest that saCoV2pp can effectively infect Vero and HEK293 cells, while infecting the other three cells was less efficient (Figure 2).\nFigure 1\nOpen in figure viewerPowerPoint\nDetection of the expression of wild\u2010type and codon\u2010optimized severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS\u2010CoV\u20102) spike proteins.

After 48\u2009hours, the supernatant was removed to detect the luciferase activity, and the pseudovirus was prepared.

To understand the tissue tropism of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 in humans, we selected several human\u2010derived cell lines, including hepatocytes (Huh7, HepG2, and HL7702), kidney cells (HEK293 and HEK293T), epithelial colorectal cells (Caco\u20102), cervical cancer cells (Hep2), skin cells (A357) and keratinocytes (Hacat) (Figure 3). SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 efficiently infected liver, kidney, and intestinal cells but was less infectious to cervical and epithelial cells. Among them, the infectivity to hepatocytes was the highest.\nFigure 3\nOpen in figure viewerPowerPoint\nInfectivity of SARS\u2010CoV2 pseudoviral particles on human different tissue cells.SaCoV2pp and saCoV1pp were used to infect human different tissue cells HEK293, 293T, HL7702, Huh7, Caco\u20102, Hep2, Hacat, A357, and the supernatant was removed after 48\u2009hours to detect luciferase activity, The pseudovirus particles of S\u0394TM as a negative control, and saCoV1pp was used as a positive control. n\u2009=\u20093, P\u2009<\u2009.05. SARS\u2010CoV\u20102, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2\n3.3 Analysis of the infectivity of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 pseudoviral particles on hepatocytes from different species\nIt is known that saCoV2pp has strong infectivity to human hepatocytes. Using the immortal liver cell line as the target cell for the saCoV2pp infection, the infectivity of saCoV2pp was analyzed in human (Huh7), monkey (RHT6.0), tree shrew (X9.0 and X9.5), mouse (Hep1\u20106), and rat (RH35) cells, and the specificity of the infection in liver cells was determined. At the same time, hepatitis C virus pseudoviral particles (HCVpp), which have a very narrow tissue tropism, were used as controls. The results show (Figure 4) that saCoV2pp cannot effectively infect monkey hepatocytes (RHT6.0), even though RHT6.0 can be infected by HCVpp; however, saCoV2pp can infect tree shrew hepatocytes. Furthermore, the results indicated that saCoV2pp cannot infect liver cells of rodents, such as rats and mice.\nFigure 4\nOpen in figure viewerPowerPoint\nInfectivity of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 pseudoviral particles on hepatocytes from different species. Both saCoV2pp and HCVpp were used to infect hepatocytes from different species; tree shrew liver cells (X9.0 and X9.5), monkey liver cells (RHT6.0), mouse liver cells (Hep1\u20106), and rat liver cells (RH35). and the supernatant was removed after 48\u2009hours to detect luciferase activity. HCVpp were used as control. (\u2010): cell background. n\u2009=\u20093, P\u2009<\u2009.05. SARS\u2010CoV\u20102, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2\n3.4 SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 pseudoviral particles for detecting neutralizing antibodies\nThe level of neutralizing antibodies is an important indicator for the evaluation of vaccine potency and reinfection resistance in recovering patients. For laboratories lacking BSL\u20103 conditions, saCoV2pp may be a viable alternative. To test the feasibility of this, we chose three rhesus monkey serum samples with known neutralizing antibody titers (GMT: 1:4, 1:32, and 1:128) measured by SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 virus in BSL\u20103 conditions. The study selected a batch of saCoV2pp (~200\u2009ng p24/mL) mixed with this serum in serial dilution. The results showed that the infectivity of saCoV2pp was not affected by the blank serum, but it could be neutralized by vaccine\u2010induced serum in a dose\u2010dependent manner (Figure 5). The neutralization effect was positively correlated with neutralizing antibody levels detected by the SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 virus, suggesting that saCoV2pp can be used for the evaluation of neutralizing antibodies.\nFigure 5\nOpen in figure viewerPowerPoint\nDetecting the neutralizing effect of immune serum with saCoV2pp and saCoV1pp. Fifty microliters of blank serum and post\u2010immune serum were mixed with 200\u2009\u00b5L of saCoV2pp or saCoV1pp, and diluted to 1:32, 1:256. After neutralization at 37\u00b0C for 1\u2009hour, this mixture was added to Huh7.5 cells and grown for 15\u2009hours. After 48\u2009hours, the supernatant was removed, and the luciferase activity in the cell lysate was measured. Fetal bovine serum/Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (2%) was used as a negative control. Serum 1: GMT\u2009=\u20091:4. Serum 2: GMT\u2009=\u20091:32. Serum 3: GMT\u2009=\u20091:128. The black dotted line represents the cut\u2010off value. n\u2009=\u20092, P\u2009<\u2009.05\nTo measure the cross\u2010protection of the SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 neutralizing serum with SARS\u2010CoV\u20101, the same serum was used to neutralize saCoV1pp. No infection inhibition effect was observed. This result indicated that the neutralizing antibody induced by the SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 S protein had weak cross\u2010protection against saCoV1pp, at least as a low\u2010level neutralizing antibody (Figure 5).4 DISCUSSION\nBecause SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 is transmitted through the respiratory tract and needs to be operated under BSL\u20103 conditions, some research on the infectivity of this novel pathogen will be obviously restricted. Pseudoviral particles are defective viruses that do not have the ability to replicate, have a low biosafety concern, and are suitable for conducting research in ordinary laboratories. Currently, SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 has evolved into a global pandemic infection. Effective vaccines are still needed to control the epidemic and eliminate pathogens from the crowd as soon as possible. Both inactivated and live attenuated vaccines require suitable cell lines for virus production. This study first tested several human vaccine\u2010producing cells in January. The results showed that rodent CHO\u2010K1 and NIH3T3 cells were not sensitive to saCoV2pp infection. The lung is known to be the primary infected tissue for SARS\u2010CoV\u20102. The diploid human embryo lung cell KMB17 has been successfully used in the production of polio vaccine,15 hepatitis A vaccine,16 and EV71 vaccine,17 and it is expected that saCoV2pp has a low infectivity to KMB17. By comparing with the most infectious hepatocyte, Huh7, and analyzing the existing transcriptome results, after normalizing and comparing, the expression of ACE2 on Huh7 cells is approximately 30 times that of KMB17 cells (unpublished data), suggesting that the abundance of the SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 receptor ACE2 on lung cells may not be high during the embryonic development period. Clinical data showed that infants and young children are not susceptible to SARS\u2010CoV\u20102,18 and the expression abundance of ACE2 in lung tissue at different ages needs to be further confirmed. In addition, saCoV2pp can efficiently infect Vero and HEK293 cells.19 Although saCoV2pp is more infectious to HEK293 cells, considering the existence of the adenovirus genome residue in HEK293 cells, it is mainly used for the production of recombinant adenoviruses and adeno\u2010associated viruses. Vero cells are still a better choice and are currently used for the adaptation of strains and the production of inactivated vaccines.\nSARS\u2010CoV\u20102 is a new pathogen. Some biological characteristics are still not clear. It is known that the virus can form viremia after infecting the human body through the respiratory system. Therefore, it is possible to further infect other organs. Using immortalized cell line to analyze the infectivity of saCoV2pp, it can be easily observed that saCoV2pp does not easily infect cervical and epithelial cells but can infect liver, kidney, and colon cells. This result is consistent with recent clinical studies that found that SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 can cause hepatitis and nephritis in patients,2, 19 and SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 nucleic acid and viruses have been detected in patients' stool and urine.20, 21\nAnimal models are necessary tools for studying the pathogenic mechanism of viruses. Based on the high sensitivity of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 to liver cells, we tested the sensitivity of commonly used animal model liver cells to saCoV2pp. The results also show that mouse and rat liver cells are not sensitive to saCoV2pp. Rhesus monkey liver cells are also less sensitive to saCoV2pp, even though RHT6 is a cell line that retains hepatocyte characteristics and can be infected by a narrow host range of HCVpp. Rhesus monkeys are an animal model, SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection in the lungs of Rhesus monkeys have been established; however, compared with humans, the susceptibility is reduced, and rhesus monkeys infected with SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 may not be prone to the symptoms of hepatitis similar to humans. Tree shrews are an ancient primate, and tree shrew liver cells can be infected by both HCVpp and saCoV2pp, suggesting the potential advantages of establishing a small animal model of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection.\nIn clinical tests, a method capable of detecting neutralizing antibodies in patients' serum is still lacking. In addition, the level of neutralizing antibodies in serum is also an important indicator for evaluating the vaccine protection mechanism. In this study, our results showed that the SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 pseudovirus particle system was a successful surrogate model to evaluate the level of neutralizing antibodies in serum. Furthermore, the induced neutralizing antibodies did not have significant cross\u2010reactivity to saCoV1pp formed by the SARS\u2010CoV\u20101 spike protein. Due to the slow cytopathic time after a SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection when viruses are used for neutralization experiments under BSL\u20103 conditions, the pseudoviral system can significantly reduce the detection time to increase the detection speed.ACKNOWLEDGMENT\nThis study was supported by the CAMS Initiative for Innovative Medicine (2016\u2010I2M\u20101\u2010019 and 2016\u2010I2M\u20101\u2010013), National Science and Technology Major Projects (2018ZX09738003\u2010007, 2018ZX10101001\u2010002), Major Science and Technology Projects of Yunnan Province (2019ZF001), National Natural Science Foundation of China (81971947), and Talent development project (D2017003).CONFLICT OF INTERESTS\nThe authors declare that there are no conflict of interests.AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS\nTP, CD, and YWB performed the research.

They can infect respiratory, gastrointestinal, hepatic, and central nervous system of human, livestock, birds, bat, mouse, and many other wild animals.1-3 The outbreaks of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2002/2003 and the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) in 2012 have demonstrated the possibility of animal\u2010to\u2010human and human\u2010to\u2010human transmission of newly emerging CoVs.4, 5 An outbreak of mystery pneumonia in Wuhan since December 2019 has been drawing tremendous attention around the world. Chinese government and researchers have been taking swift measures to control the outbreak and conduct the etiological studies. The causative agent of the mystery pneumonia has been identified as a novel coronavirus (nCoV) by deep sequencing and etiological investigations by at least five independent laboratories of China (http://virological.org/ and https://www.gisaid.org/). On 12 January 2020, the World Health Organization temporarily named the new virus as 2019 novel coronavirus (2019\u2010nCoV). The sporadic emergence and outbreaks of new types of CoVs remind us that CoVs are a severe global health threat. It is highly likely that new CoV outbreaks are unavoidable in the future due to changes of the climate and ecology, and the increased interactions of human with animals. Thus, there is an urgent need to develop effective therapies and vaccines against CoVs.2 CORONAVIRAL GENOME STRUCTURE AND REPLICATION\nCoVs belong to the subfamily Coronavirinae in the family of Coronaviridae of the order Nidovirales, and this subfamily includes four genera: Alphacoronavirus, Betacoronavirus, Gammacoronavirus, and Deltacoronavirus (Figure 1A). The genome of CoVs is a single\u2010stranded positive\u2010sense RNA (+ssRNA) (~30\u2009kb) with 5\u2032\u2010cap structure and 3\u2032\u2010poly\u2010A tail. The genomic RNA is used as template to directly translate polyprotein 1a/1ab (pp1a/pp1ab), which encodes nonstructural proteins (nsps) to form the replication\u2010transcription complex (RTC) in a double\u2010membrane vesicles (DMVs).6 Subsequently, a nested set of subgenomic RNAs (sgRNAs) are synthesized by RTC in a manner of discontinuous transcription.7 These subgenomic messenger RNAs (mRNAs) possess common 5\u2032\u2010leader and 3\u2032\u2010terminal sequences. Transcription termination and subsequent acquisition of a leader RNA occurs at transcription regulatory sequences, located between open reading frames (ORFs). These minus\u2010strand sgRNAs serve as the templates for the production of subgenomic mRNAs.8, 9\nFigure 1\nOpen in figure viewerPowerPoint\nThe genomic structure and phylogenetic tree of coronaviruses. A, The phylogenetic tree of representative CoVs, with the new coronavirus 2019\u2010nCoV highlighted in red. B, The genome structure of four genera of coronaviruses. Pp1a and pp1b represent the two long polypeptides that are processed into 16 nonstructural proteins. S, E, M, and N indicate the four structural proteins spike, envelope, membrane, and nucleocapsid. 2019\u2010nCoV, 2019 novel coronavirus; CoVs, coronavirus; HE, hemagglutinin\u2010esterase. Viral names: HKU, coronaviruses identified by Hong Kong University; HCoV, human coronavirus; IBV, infectious bronchitis virus; MHV, murine hepatitis virus; TGEV, transmissible gastroenteritis virus\nThe genome and subgenomes of a typical CoV contain at least six ORFs. The first ORFs (ORF1a/b), about two\u2010thirds of the whole genome length, encode 16 nsps (nsp1\u201016), except Gammacoronavirus that lacks nsp1. There is a \u22121 frameshift between ORF1a and ORF1b, leading to production of two polypeptides: pp1a and pp1ab. These polypeptides are processed by virally encoded chymotrypsin\u2010like protease (3CLpro) or main protease (Mpro) and one or two papain\u2010like protease into 16 nsps.10, 11 Other ORFs on the one\u2010third of the genome near the 3\u2032\u2010terminus encodes at least four main structural proteins: spike (S), membrane (M), envelope (E), and nucleocapsid (N) proteins. Besides these four main structural proteins, different CoVs encode special structural and accessory proteins, such as HE protein, 3a/b protein, and 4a/b protein (Figure 1B, lower panel). All the structural and accessory proteins are translated from the sgRNAs of CoVs.7\nThe genome sequence alignment of CoVs shows 58% identity on the nsp\u2010coding region and 43% identity on the structural protein\u2010coding region among different CoVs, with 54% at the whole genome level (Figure 1B, upper panel), suggesting the nsps are more conserved and the structural proteins are more diverse in need of adaptation to new hosts. Since the mutation rates in the replication of RNA viruses are much higher than that of DNA viruses, the genomes of RNA viruses are usually less than 10\u2009kb in length. However, the CoV genome is much larger, with roughly 30\u2009kb in length, the largest known RNA viruses. The maintenance of such a large genome of CoVs may be related to the special features of the CoV RTC, which contains several RNA processing enzymes such as the 3\u2032\u20105\u2032 exoribonuclease of nsp14. The 3\u2032\u20105\u2032 exoribonuclease is unique to CoVs among all RNA viruses, probably providing a proofreading function of the RTC.12-14 Sequence analysis shows that the 2019\u2010nCoV possesses a typical genome structure of CoV and belongs to the cluster of betacoronaviruses that includes Bat\u2010SARS\u2010like (SL)\u2010ZC45, Bat\u2010SL ZXC21, SARS\u2010CoV, and MERS\u2010CoV. Based on the phylogenetic tree of CoVs, 2019\u2010nCoV is more closely related to bat\u2010SL\u2010CoV ZC45 and bat\u2010SL\u2010CoV ZXC21 and more distantly related to SARS\u2010CoV (Figure 1A).3 FUNCTIONS OF NONSTRUCTURAL AND STRUCTURAL PROTEINS IN CORONAVIRAL REPLICATION\nMost of the nsps of nsp1\u201016 have been reported for their specific roles in the replication of CoVs. However, the functions of some of the nsps are unknown or not well understood. The known functions of the 16 nsps are summarized in Table 1.\nTable 1.

Homotrimers of S proteins make up the spikes on the viral surface and they are responsible for attachment to host receptors.50, 51 The M protein has three transmembrane domains and it shapes the virions, promotes membrane curvature, and binds to the nucleocapsid.52, 53 The E protein plays a role in virus assembly and release, and it involved in viral pathogenesis.54, 55 The N protein contains two domains, both of which can bind virus RNA genome via different mechanisms. It is reported that N protein can bind to nsp3 protein to help tether the genome to RTC, and package the encapsidated genome into virions.56-58 N is also an antagonist of interferon (IFN) and viral encoded repressor of RNA interference, which appears to be beneficial for the viral replication.59\n3.1 Diversity of CoV pathogenesis\nDifferent CoVs display diverse host range and tissue tropism. Usually, alphacoronaviruses and betacoronaviruses infect mammals. In contrast, gammacoronaviruses and deltacoronaviruses infect birds and fish, but some of them can also infect mammals.4, 60 Before 2019, there were only six CoVs that were known to infect human and cause respiratory diseases. HCoV\u2010229E, HCoV\u2010OC43, HCoV\u2010NL63, and HKU1 cause only mild upper respiratory disease, and in rare cases some of them can cause severe infection in infants, young children and elders. SARS\u2010CoV and MERS\u2010CoV can infect lower respiratory tract and cause severe respiratory syndrome in human.56, 61 Some CoVs can infect livestock, birds, bats, mice, whales, and many other wild animals, and they can cause great economic loss. For example, in 2016, an HKU2\u2010related bat CoV, swine acute diarrhea syndrome CoV, caused a large\u2010scale outbreak of fatal disease in pigs in Southern China, and more than 24\u2009000 piglets were dead.62 This is the first documented spillover of a bat CoV that caused severe disease in livestock.4, 63\nThe new CoV, 2019\u2010nCoV, which belongs to betacoronaviruses based on sequence analysis (Figure 1A), can also infect the lower respiratory tract and cause pneumonia in human, but it seems that the symptoms are milder than SARS and MERS. Up to 20 January 2020, 291 cases in total have been confirmed in China by sequence analysis, clinical diagnosis and epidemiological examination, including 270 cases in Wuhan and 21 cases in Beijing, Shanghai, and Guangdong (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/yjb/new_index.shtml). In addition, four cases were confirmed in three other countries, including two cases in Thailand, one case in Japan, and one case in South Korea; all these patients had stayed in or visited Wuhan 2 weeks before the onset of the symptoms. Six deaths and 63 patients with severe symptoms were reported in Wuhan (http://wjw.wuhan.gov.cn/). Among the six death cases, four patients with published information are elder people of over 60 years old and have other illnesses before the infection, such as abdominal tumor and chronic liver disease, myocarditis and renal dysfunction, and cardiovascular disease.\nMany of the patients have direct or indirect contact with the Wuhan Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market that is believed to be the original place of the outbreak of the 2019\u2010nCoV. However, transmission of 2019\u2010nCoV from fish to human is unlikely. The 2019\u2010nCoV and fish CoVs such as Beluga Whale CoV/SW1 belong to different genera and apparently have different host ranges. As the Wuhan seafood market also sells other animals, the natural host of 2019\u2010nCoV awaits to be identified. Due to the possibility of transmission from animal to human, CoVs in livestock and other animals including bats and wild animals sold in the market should be constantly monitored. In addition, more and more evidence indicate the new virus 2019\u2010nCoV is spread via the route of human\u2010to\u2010human transmission because there are infections of people who did not visit Wuhan but had close contact with family members who had visited Wuhan and got infected (http://www.cctv.com/).\nThe major pathogenic CoVs are listed in Table 2 for better understanding the pathogenesis of CoVs.\nTable 2.

Recombinant IFN with ribavirin only has limited effects against CoVs infection.64 After SARS and MERS epidemics, great efforts have been devoted to development of new antivirals targeting CoVs proteases, polymerases, MTases, and entry proteins, however, none of them has been shown to be efficacious in clinical trials.65-67 Plasma and antibodies obtained from the convalescent patients have been proposed for use in treatment.68\nIn addition, various vaccine strategies, such as using inactivated viruses, live\u2010attenuated viruses, viral vector\u2010based vaccines, subunit vaccines, recombinant proteins, and DNA vaccines, have been developed but have only been evaluated in animals so far.69, 70\nSince there is no effective therapy or vaccine, the best measures now are to control the source of infection, early diagnosis, reporting, isolation, supportive treatments, and timely publishing epidemic information to avoid unnecessary panic. For individuals, good personal hygiene, fitted mask, ventilation, and avoiding crowded places will help to prevent CoVs infection.ACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThis study was supported by the Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No.: #81620108020 and #81672008), National Science and Technology Major Project (#2018ZX10733403), Shenzhen Science and Technology Program (Grant No.: KQTD20180411143323605) and Guangdong Provincial \u201cZhujiang Talents Program\u201d (2017).", "20289": "", "21571": "", "1890060309": "", "1890290404": "", "20645": "", "10499": "", "20556": "", "2161": "", "1890110407": "", "25773": "1 INTRODUCTION\nCoronaviruses (CoVs) are enveloped, positive\u2010sensed, single\u2010stranded RNA viruses belonging to the Coronaviridae family.1 They have been categorized based on antigenic properties and phylogenetic analyses in three main groups2: (a) alpha\u2010CoVs, mainly responsible for gastrointestinal disorders; (b) beta\u2010CoVs, that include: (i) bat coronavirus, (ii) the human severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) virus, (iii) the Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (MERS) virus; (c) gamma\u2010CoVs, that mainly infect avian species. Some variants of CoVs are associated with outbreaks, some others are continuously circulating and cause mostly mild respiratory infections (eg, the common cold). The most well known of these CoVs is the SARS\u2010CoV, which between 2002 and 2003 was responsible to cause an outbreak that spread around the world and resulted in over 8000 cases and 774 deaths, with a case fatality rate of around 9% to 11%.3 In 2012, a novel CoV, MERS\u2010CoV, causing severe respiratory symptoms was identified.4 Very recently, in December 2019, a novel beta\u2010CoV, was responsible of a new illness, first detected in Wuhan, China.5 We now know this to be another outbreak of CoV in humans (the 7th), that was recently renamed as SARS\u2010CoV\u20102. The origin of the virus is still unclear, however, genomic analysis suggests nCoV is most closely related to viruses previously identified in bats.6\nIn the first week of March 2020, over 98.192 confirmed cases and 3,380 deaths have been reported globally.7 The case counts are dramatically rising in part due to increased surveillance and testing. While the outbreak seems to be centered in Wuhan, which is now under quarantine, the virus has spread throughout China and abroad, including Western and South\u2010Eastern Pacific regions, European regions, Eastern Mediterranean regions as well as many states in the United States of America.8 It comes amid signs of the virus's shift away from its origins in China, with Italy, Iran, and South Korea emerging as the other countries hit hardest by the deadly disease. Italy is the worst affected country in Europe, with more than 4636 cases, a rise of 778 in a day, and a death toll of 197, an increase of 49.9 Nevertheless, there is still limited information about the genomic epidemiology of the SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 circulating in Italy from genomic surveillance studies that impairs our understanding of the virus introduction, establishment, and dissemination in the country. Thus, to better understand the emergence of the recent SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 epidemic in Italy, we analyzed a larger and updated dataset of recently released data of the COVID\u20102019 epidemic to improve more effective intervention strategies.2 MATERIALS AND METHODS\n2.1 Phylogenetic analysis\nThe dataset comprised (n\u2009=\u2009141) complete genomes sequences from the current (2019\u20102020) SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 epidemic retrieved from GISAID (https://www.gisaid.org/) database. The alignment was performed using MAFFT online program.10 The complete dataset was assessed for the presence of phylogenetic signal by applying the likelihood mapping analysis implemented in the IQ\u2010TREE 1.6.8 software (http://www.iqtree.org).11 A maximum likelihood (ML) phylogeny was reconstructed using IQ\u2010TREE 1.6.8 software under the general time\u2010reversible nucleotide substitution model with a proportion of invariant sites (GTR+I) which was inferred in jModelTest (https://github.com/ddarriba/jmodeltest2) as the best fitting model.123 RESULTS\nTo better understand the establishment and transmission of the novel SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 in Italy, the recent Italian genomes available on the GISAID database were added to a dataset of 138 SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 genomes from the global epidemic. An ML phylogenetic tree (Figure 1) was built to explore the recent Italian genomes relationship with previous worldwide isolates. ML phylogenies suggested that the three Italian strains, grouped into two different well\u2010supported phylogenetic clades (bootstrap score [BS] 0.80, 0.99, respectively). We found that two isolates from Italy (EPI_ISL_410546 a Chinese tourist from Hubei Province, and EPI_ISL_412974 the first Italian case isolate in Rome Italy) fall within a clade (BS\u2009=\u200994%) (Figure 1A clade 1) including sequences from several countries as China, Japan, Singapore, England, Australia, and Canada. However, it is important to note that sequences from China are positioned basally to this first clade, reinforcing the idea that the first introduction event could be mediated, as suspected by China.\nFigure 1\nOpen in figure viewerPowerPoint\nMaximum likelihood phylogeny, estimated from complete and near\u2010complete coronavirus (CoV) genomes using genome data available in GISAID. Colors represent different locations (panels A and B represent expansions of the clades containing the Italian CoV isolates [green]) in clade 1 closely related with sequence from England, in clade B closely related with sequences from Germany\nWe also identified that one Italian strain (EPI_ISL_412973 from the province of Lombardy) isolated in February 2020, grouped separately into a second clade (Figure 1B clade 2) including isolates from Germany, Finland, Switzerland, and Mexico. Phylogenetic analyses further suggest that the CoV epidemic might have been reintroduce to the country via Germany, since the basal sequence of this clade is a case that emerged in Munich in Germany in January 2020, highlighting a complex dynamic of transmission and a tight connection within European countries.4 DISCUSSION\nIn this study, we investigate the transmission path of the novel SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 in Italy. Our results indicate that the SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 circulation in Italy likely started from different multiple introductions from China and Germany (Figure 1, clades 1 and 2) (suggesting a possible European linkage) followed by autochthonous transmission within Italy. Moreover, more genomic data will be fundamental to shed light on the epidemiological dynamics of the virus in the country helping to understand how the virus is spreading both around the world and thought time. More genomic surveillance efforts during epidemics should be undertaken to provide enough data to make reliable inferences on the molecular epidemiology of the rapidly evolving virus. Phylogenetic inference robustness will be improved if other genomic sequences will be available to build an even more informative dataset despite the low heterogeneity of the sequenced strains. Consequently, this analysis has to be considered as the first preliminary report regarding the SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 epidemic in Italy that highlights two independent introductions probably mediated by China and Germany, respectively. This could reinforce the tight connection within samples that have been isolated all over Europe, indicating that the virus is spreading quite widely in Europe suggesting that it could be likely spreading in the general population.\nIn conclusion, our study shows that genomic data generated in real\u2010time can be employed to assist public health in monitoring and understanding the outbreak of novel emerging viral13 pathogens.ACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThe authors would like to thank all personnel from Health Surveillance Systems who coordinated surveillance in Italy.

In children below the age of five, the combined global mortality of only influenza and RSV reaches 300\u2009000 deaths each year.2 Other respiratory viruses, such as adenovirus and rhinovirus, are associated with lower mortality, but significant morbidity, causing a huge economic burden.3 The highly pathogenic emerging and reemerging coronaviruses that may cause epidemics or pandemics, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS\u2010CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS\u2010CoV), have posed great threat to global public health. Most recently, a novel coronavirus 2019\u2010nCoV (https://www.who.int) has caused the pneumonia in 41 confirmed cases of patients, including 7 in serious condition, 1 dead, and 2 recovered (https://www.shine.cn/news/nation/2001119576/). The full genomic sequence of this coronavirus was released on January 10, 2020 (http://virological.org/t/initial\u2010genome\u2010release\u2010of\u2010novel\u2010coronavirus/319?from=groupmessage&isappinstalled=0), which is more than 82% identical to those of SARS\u2010CoV and bat SARS\u2010like coronavirus (SL\u2010CoV).4\nAccurate and fast diagnosis of the causative viral pathogens is important to select the appropriate treatment, save people's lives, stop the epidemics, and reduce unnecessary use of antibiotics. All viruses mentioned above can cause both upper and lower respiratory tract infections, as well as overlapping clinical presentations, making it difficult for physicians to distinguish the causative agents without a solid laboratory analysis. Conventional diagnostic methods, such as viral culture and direct/indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA), are time\u2010consuming and labor intensive with limited sensitivity. Rapid and accurate diagnosis of respiratory viruses can help in epidemiologic monitoring, along with taking effective prevention steps and implementing appropriate antiviral therapies. Over the past decades, an evolution in viral diagnostic testing has been seen, all the way from conventional approaches to rapid antigen detection. More recently, highly sensitive nucleic acid amplification tests (NAAT) and point\u2010of\u2010care tests (POCT) have been developed.2\nIn this review, we describe various approaches currently available, or under development, for diagnosis of common respiratory virus infections in humans. It is anticipated that these data will assist clinical laboratories to rapidly and accurately diagnose respiratory viruses, thus providing physicians with essential information for timely and appropriate treatment of patients. The commonly used diagnostic approaches for influenza virus, RSV, coronavirus, adenovirus, and rhinovirus are summarized in Table 1 and described in detail in the following review.\nTable 1.

This family consists of five genera (influenza A virus, influenza B virus, influenza C virus, Thogotovirus, and Isavirus), which are classified based on internal nucleoprotein (NP) and matrix (M) proteins. Among these genera, only influenza A and influenza B viruses cause clinical diseases. Influenza B viral infections usually cause localized outbreaks, whereas influenza A virus is the primary pathogen for human infections and, thus, the major cause of large influenza epidemics and pandemics.44 Based on the glycoproteins hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA), which are located on the viral surface, influenza A viruses are divided into various subtypes. Until now, 18 HA (H1\u2010H18) and 11 NA (N1\u2010N11) subtypes have been identified.44 A number of diagnostic approaches, including virus isolation, as well as some emerging molecular\u2010based approaches, have been used to detect influenza viruses in clinical laboratories.\n2.1 Traditional approaches for influenza virus detection\nViral culture is the gold standard for diagnosing influenza viral infections. This approach includes inoculation of the corresponding cell lines, such as Madin Darby canine kidney (MDCK), A549, and rhesus monkey kidney (LLC MK2), with clinical samples, propagation for seven to 10 days to monitor the development of cytopathic effect (CPE), and final confirmation of influenza virus infection by hemadsorption using erythrocytes, specific antibody staining or immunofluorescence microscopy.5 IFA has been used since the 1960s. It directly stains respiratory epithelial cells derived from nasopharyngeal aspirates or swabs with fluorescently labeled influenza virus\u2010specific antibodies.5 Currently, several FDA\u2010approved enzyme\u2010linked immunosorbent (ELISA)\u2010based tests are available for diagnosis of influenza virus infections. However, ELISA\u2010based tests often show lower sensitivity compared with nucleic acid\u2010based methods. A novel immunoassay based on europium nanoparticles has been developed to rapidly detect 29 strains of influenza A and 10 strains of influenza B viruses with high sensitivity and specificity.6\n2.2 Molecular\u2013based approaches for influenza virus detection\nThe above\u2010described conventional diagnostic methods generally have lower sensitivity and specificity relative to molecular methods. With the development of laboratory approaches for virus diagnosis, isolation of viral pathogens from secretion samples has become much easier than before.\nThe rapid influenza diagnostic test (RIDT) offers a faster approach for detecting both influenza A and B viruses. However, it has limited ability to further identify the subtypes of influenza viruses. In addition, its test performance (ie, sensitivity and specificity) varies widely. For example, in November 2009, 290 suspected influenza patients were analyzed using direct antigen EZ Flu A+B kit. The sensitivity and specificity of RIDT were 40.5% and 94.5%, respectively.45 NAAT assays based on polymerase chain reaction (PCR) detect virus\u2010specific genetic materials, rather than viral antigens or antibodies. Therefore, optimal extraction of viral genetic materials is required. One of the advantages of NAAT over RIDT is that NAAT is able to identify different subtypes of influenza viruses. Trombetta's group found that NAAT shows much higher sensitivity for both influenza A and influenza B viruses, despite its relative lower specificity.7 A variety of NAAT assays, such as reverse transcriptase\u2010PCR, loop\u2010mediated isothermal amplification\u2010based assay (LAMP), DNA\u2010microarray\u2010based and sequencing\u2010based tests, are appearing for diagnosis of influenza viral infections in humans.5 Using the LAMP approach, Poon's group demonstrated 100% sensitivity for detection of seasonal influenza A H1N1 and H3N2 viruses from clinical specimens with analytical sensitivity of 10 copies per reaction.8 Compared with the RT\u2010PCR\u2010based assay, a real\u2010time reverse transcription LAMP\u2010based assay (RT\u2010LAMP) showed a sensitivity of 97.8% and a specificity of 100% for detecting 2009 H1N1 pandemic virus.9 LAMP\u2010based assays have also been used to detect the highly pathogenic H5N1 and H7N9 avian influenza viruses, having comparable, or higher, sensitivities than RT\u2010PCR\u2010based approaches.10-12 However, the high cost of NAAT, the complexity of the equipment required, and the need for trained professionals make NAAT assays less practical in areas with limited resources.\nIn addition to the above approaches, the DNA\u2010microarray\u2010based approach has been developed to detect influenza viruses, offering a novel tool for accurate and rapid diagnosis of influenza epidemics or pandemics. This assay uses multiple oligonucleotides specially designed to target conserved sequences encoding HA, NA and M proteins of influenza A and B viruses.5 For instance, Zhao's research group has developed a gold nanoparticle\u2010based genomic microarray assay, which is able to differentiate H5N1 viruses from the major seasonal influenza A viruses (H1N1, H3N2). This can be explained by oligonucleotides which are designed on the basis of consensus sequence of the HA and NA genes of the H5N1 virus and M gene of H1N1, H3N2, and H5N1 viruses.13 The same group has expanded the platform and designed specific oligonucleotides for HA, NA and M genes of the 2009 pandemic H1N1 virus, enabling the detection of the 2009 pandemic H1N1 virus and distinguish it from other influenza A viruses.46\nParticularly, a combinational diagnostic platform is reported using nanomicroarray for screening and multiplex next\u2010generation sequencing (NGS) assays for confirmation to simultaneously identify and characterize influenza A and B viruses in a single sample.47 Recently, a high\u2010throughput whole genome sequencing (WGS) method with the MinION portable sequencer was developed to test influenza A and B viruses, as subsequently validated by the Illumina MiSeq platform. The overall accuracy, precision, as well as recall rates, were 99.95%, 97.88%, and 89.41%, respectively, from 1D reads and 99.97%, 99.86%, and 93.28%, respectively, from 1D2 reads.143 HUMAN RESPIRATORY SYNCYTIAL VIRUS AND ITS DIAGNOSTIC APPROACHES\nHuman RSV is a nonsegmented, negative\u2010sense and single\u2010stranded RNA virus of the Paramyxoviridae family. The genome of RSV includes ten genes that encode eleven proteins. RSV can be classified into subgroups A and B according to the genome sequence and the reactivity of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) to the surface glycoprotein (G) and fusion protein (F).48, 49 RSV is a leading cause of severe respiratory disease in immunocompromised populations, such as infants and elderly populations, with significant morbidity and mortality worldwide. Early and accurate RSV diagnosis is crucially important for appropriate treatment.\n3.1 Traditional approaches for human respiratory syncytial virus detection\nELISA and immunofluorescence assays are traditional assays to identify RSV. However, a modified ELISA method has been developed, targeting RSV F protein and it can detect RSV within 25\u2009minutes at low cost.15 The immunofluorescence assay can rapidly detect RSV antigens using a fluorescence\u2010tagged primary or secondary antibody. For example, the direct fluorescent antibody assay (DFA), which requires a certain number of cells in the specimen, with a sensitivity and specificity of 94% and 96.8%, respectively, is widely used for detection of RSV in clinical laboratories because of its simplicity and rapidity. For this reason, this assay has particular use in resource\u2010limited countries since it can potentially eliminate prolonged hospitalization and unnecessary use of antibiotics.16\nSemiconductor quantum dots can be used for biological and biomedical applications because of their unique size\u2010dependent optical and electronic features. The assay detects RSV F protein using thioglycolate (TGA)\u2010coated cadmium telluride (CdTe) particles, which are bioconjugated with RSV anti\u2010F protein mAb.17 It overcomes some of DFA's disadvantage, such as relatively low sensitivity, because of the background staining, and the rapid fading of the dye. Also, this assay is more sensitive than RT\u2010PCT. By probing F and G proteins with QDs, confocal microscopy could detect the progression of RSV infection in the HEp\u20102 cell line, and this method was found to be more sensitive compared to RT\u2010PCR.18\nLateral flow immunoassay (LFIA) is another rapid RSV detection method based on an immunochromatographic technique using the samples of nasal washes or aspirates. Many LFIA kits are now available in the market, such as BD Directigen EZ RSV, Binax Now RSV, RSV Respi\u2010Strip, Remel Xpect, and QuickLab RSV Test.19-21 The sensitivity and specificity of the abovementioned kits are normally higher than 90% and 95%, but they differ by manufacturer.\n3.2 PCR\u2010based approaches for human respiratory syncytial virus detection\nThe PCR method is based on the nested RT\u2010PCR technique involving the outer and inner primers designed from the F gene of RSV\u2010A or \u2010B. This method has been developed in both circle time and operability in adult infections.22 Therefore, it can be used to detect samples with low viral titers and sensitively perform identification using antigen\u2010based detection approaches.\nThe following novel PCR detection methods have been established by modification of the conventional PCR approach. For example, real\u2010time quantitative PCR (RT\u2010qPCR) is a rapid, specific, and sensitive TaqMan PCR method for detection, subgrouping, and quantitation of pathogens. This assay increases the sensitivity of conventional PCR. It needs two sets of primer\u2010probe pairs, which come from the nucleotide sequence of nucleocapsid (N) gene or Fusion (F) gene targeting RSV\u2010A and RSV\u2010B, respectively.23, 24 A quantitative TaqMan PCR assay was once used to detect 175 nasopharyngeal aspirates obtained from children with respiratory symptoms in Hong Kong, and it detected 36 RSV\u2010positive samples, including 10 as RSV\u2010A and 26 as RSV\u2010B. In contrast, a cell culture\u2010based assay only identified 21, and an immunofluorescence assay identified 32 RSV\u2010positive specimens, all of which were among those identified by the TaqMan PCR assay, suggesting the greater accuracy and sensitivity of the TaqMan PCR assay.24 In addition, locked nucleic acid (LNA)\u2010based one\u2010tube nested real\u2010time (OTNRT)\u2010PCR is an assay with very high sensitivity and low incidence of cross\u2010contamination for detection of RSV.25 A total of 143 nasopharyngeal aspirate samples that tested RSV\u2010negative by qRT\u2010PCR were confirmed as RSV\u2010positive by sequencing the OTNRT\u2010PCR products,25 indicating that OTNRT\u2010PCR is more sensitive than RT\u2010qPCR for detection of RSV in clinical samples. Moreover, the rapid reverse\u2010transcription recombinase\u2010aided amplification (RT\u2010RAA) assay was developed as a molecular\u2010based diagnostic method to detect subgroup RSV A and B genomes in clinical specimens. This method mainly utilizes an enzyme mixture, including single\u2010strand DNA binding protein (SSB), recombinase UvsX, and DNA polymerase, to detect RNA amplicons of RSV.26 It is performed at 39\u00b0C in less than 30\u2009minutes with high specificity. Furthermore, reverse transcription strand invasion\u2010based amplification (RT\u2010SIBA) is reverse transcription isothermal nucleic acid amplification for rapid detection of RSV with good sensitivity since it can detect as few as 10 copies of RSV RNA within 20\u2009minutes.27 RT\u2010SIBA does not need highly purified RNA for detection of RSV, which can reduce the complexity of specimen preparation and shorten the total detection cycle in clinical specimens.4 CORONAVIRUS AND ITS DIAGNOSTIC APPROACHES\nCoronaviruses belong to the family of Coronaviridae. Bats have been recognized as natural reservoir and vectors of a variety of coronaviruses and the viruses have crossed species barriers to infect humans and many other different kinds of animals, including avians, rodents, and chiropters.50, 51 Coronavirus may cause respiratory and neurological diseases.52 So far, six human coronaviruses (HCoVs) have been identified, including HCoV\u2010229E, HCoV\u2010HKU1, HCoV\u2010OC43, HCoV\u2010NL63, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS\u2010CoV), and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS\u2010CoV).53 MERS\u2010CoV is a human coronavirus first reported in June 2012 that can cause human respiratory diseases.52 It has been classified as a lineage C \u03b2\u2010coronavirus, and its structure comprises a ~30\u2009kb positive\u2010sense, single\u2010stranded RNA genome, which is closely related to the lineage C \u03b2\u2010coronaviruses of Tylonycteris bat CoV HKU4 and Pipistrellus bat CoV HKU5.54 By genomic analysis of lineage C \u03b2\u2010coronaviruses, human MERS\u2010CoV has shown high similarities to MERS\u2010CoV derived from camels with >99.5% nucleotide identities, suggesting that the human and camel isolates belong to the same coronavirus species.4 As of September 30, 2019, 2468 laboratory\u2010confirmed cases of MERS\u2010CoV infections, including 851 deaths in 27 countries, have been reported to WHO (https://www.who.int/emergencies/mers\u2010cov/en/). Because no commercial vaccines or therapeutic treatments are currently available for MERS, rapid and accurate diagnosis of MERS\u2010CoV is important for the prevention of its transmission and outbreaks.\nCurrent diagnostic tests for coronavirus include RT\u2010PCR, real\u2010time reverse transcription PCR (rRT\u2010PCR), reverse transcription loop\u2010mediated isothermal amplification (RT\u2010LAMP), as well as real\u2010time RT\u2010LAMP.51, 55-58\nA duplex RT\u2010PCR method has been developed based on primers and probes targeting the conserved spike S2 gene of SARS\u2010CoV and MERS\u2010CoV. By using pUC57SARS\u2010pS2 as a template for SARS\u2010CoV and pGEM\u2010MERSS2 as a template for MERS\u2010CoV, respectively, adequate detection limits of 50 to 100 copies/mL were achieved.28 The singleplex RT\u2010iiPCR assays are designed to detect MERS\u2010CoV envelope gene (upE) and open reading frame 1a (ORF1a) genes separately. Compared to the reference singleplex RT\u2010qPCR assay, the sensitivities of the singleplex MERS\u2010CoV ORF1a and upE RT\u2010iiPCR assays are 99.03% and 100%, respectively.29\nSix commercially available MERS\u2010CoV RNA detection kits based on rRT\u2010PCR are available, including AccuPower (Bioneer, Korea), Anyplex (Seegene, Korea), DiaPlexQ (SolGent, Korea), LightMix (Roche Molecular Diagnostics, Switzerland), UltraFast kits (Nanobiosys, Korea) and PowerChek (Kogene Biotech, Korea). The PowerChek MERS Real\u2010time PCR, Anyplex II MERS\u2010CoV (upE) Real\u2010time Detection and DiaPlexQ MERS Virus Detection kits consist of two steps. A single gene targets the upstream region of the upE region for screening, and multiple genes target both upE and ORF1a regions for final confirmation.30 The AccuPower MERS\u2010CoV Real Time RT\u2010PCR, LightMix Molecular Dx MERS\u2010CoV upE/ORF1a, and UltraFast LabChip MERSCoV Real\u2010time PCR kits use two single gene\u2010targeting reagents to detect the upE and ORF1a genes simultaneously.30 No cross\u2010reactivity has been reported with other respiratory viruses. Based on the validation tests, including 28 specificity panels and 9 clinical specimens, the sensitivity and specificity of all these rRT\u2010PCR kits for detecting upE and ORF1a reach 100% (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.60\u20101.00) and 100% (95% CI, 0.79\u20101.00), respectively. Based on results from the high inhibition panel, AccuPower and PowerChek have lowest sensitivity to the presence of PCR inhibition.29 Therefore, the overall sensitivity and specificity of the above six rRT\u2010PCR kits are sufficient for diagnosing MERS\u2010CoV infection.\nIn the RT\u2010LAMP assay, two primer sets were constructed with one set targeting the N gene and one set targeting the ORF1a gene. Both sets have shown high efficiency in amplifying target sequences derived from different MERS\u2010CoV strains with no cross\u2010reactivity observed with other respiratory viruses.31 Huang's research group has established a nucleic acid visualization technique that combines the RT\u2010LAMP technique and a vertical flow visualization strip (RT\u2010LAMP\u2010VF) to detect the N gene of MERS\u2010CoV.52 The RT\u2010LAMP\u2010VF assay can detect 2\u2009\u00d7\u2009101 copies/\u03bcL of synthesized RNA transcript and 1\u2009\u00d7\u2009101 copies/\u03bcL of MERS\u2010CoV RNA without cross\u2010reactivity to multiple SARS\u2010related\u2010CoVs, including HKU1, HKU4, OC43 and 229E, thus exhibiting high specificity.\nRT\u2010LAMP and RT\u2010LAMP\u2010VF mentioned above are assays for rapid and accurate detection of MERS\u2010CoV infection. Bonhan Kooa's team designed an arch\u2010shaped multiple\u2010target sensor capable of rapid pathogen identification using direct amplification in clinical samples. The method can detect a variety of viruses including MERS\u2010CoV with high sensitivity and specificity and is able to distinguish MERS\u2010CoV from HCoV in clinical samples within 20\u2009minutes.32 The TaqMan probe\u2010based one\u2010step rRT\u2010PCR assays provide rapid and sensitive internal diagnostic detection of MERS\u2010CoV by detecting the upE and open reading frame (ORF) 1b. This method is reliable, specific and reproducible. In addition, different from the traditional two\u2010step sample detection method, the one\u2010step method combines two steps into one step, thus increasing the sensitivity of the measurement, for example, <10 and \u226650 copies of RNA template per reaction for upE and ORF1b, respectively.33 The MAb\u2010based rapid NP detection method for MERS\u2010CoV was used for preliminary rapid screening of MERS\u2010CoV infection due to its high specificity but moderate sensitivity. The detection limit of this assay is about 103.7 to 104.2 TCID50/mL of MERS\u2010CoV, and the sensitivity is about 25\u2010 to 100\u2010fold lower than that of antigen capture ELISA.345 HUMAN ADENOVIRUS AND ITS DIAGNOSTIC APPROACHES\nAdenovirus (AdV) infections are now regarded as a significant source of human or animal morbidity and mortality. Human adenovirus (hAdV) infections are readily transmittable, infecting all age groups, especially infants and the elderly, as well as those with immunodeficiency and organ transplantation.59 HAdV has a non\u2010enveloped spherical structure with a diameter of 70 to 100\u2009nm. The external shell consists of 252 capsomeres, including 240 hexons and 12 pentons, which are composed of an icosahedral viral capsid. The capsomeres are arranged on 20 triangular surfaces, making the shell form 30 edges and 12 vertices. The genome of hAdV exists in the capsid in the form of linear double\u2010stranded DNA with sizes ranging from 34 to more than 37\u2009kb. The genome contains the early expressed E1~E4 genes associated with replication of hAdV, intermediate gene of \u2168 and \u2163a2, and late region genes L1~L5 associated with the production of mature virions.60 HAdV belongs to the Adenoviridae family, and it has been classified into seven species (A to G) with over 50 serotypes based on hexon and fiber protein characteristics, relative nucleic homology, immunochemical responses, biological properties, and phylogenetic relationships.35, 61, 62 This subdivision has some clinical relevance, essentially because different hAdVs differ in tissue orientation and disease type. HAdV can cause multiple diseases, such as respiratory disease (hAdV\u2010B, \u2010C, and \u2010E), gastroenteritis (hAdV\u2010F and \u2010G), keratoconjunctivitis (hAdV\u2010B and \u2010D), and meningoencephalitis (hAdV\u2010A, \u2010B, and \u2010D).59, 63 Therefore, effective and rapid diagnosis of hAdV ahead of its progression will provide for effective monitoring of hAdV infection and guarantee timely and effective treatment of hAdV\u2010associated diseases.\n5.1 Tratitional approaches for human adenovirus detection\nThe isolation of adenovirus after growth in cell culture and its immunological detection are generally thought to be the \u201cgold standard.\u201d36 Samples, such as throat swabs and stool specimen, collected from patients are treated overnight with antibiotics, centrifuged, and supernatant inoculated with susceptible cells (Hep\u20102, Graham 293, or A549). CPE is observed after cell incubation at 37\u00b0C, and then the hAdV is isolated. The serotype of hAdV can be determined by detecting the antigenic determinant of penton proteins by the hemagglutination inhibition (HI) test. HAdV can also be typed by detecting the antigenic determinant of hexon proteins by neutralizing test (NT). However, these methods are time\u2010consuming, require experienced technicians to analyze the results, and the results are still uncertain. Different types of hAdV infection can cause different diseases and different symptoms; thus, detection of antigens and antibodies can make the diagnosis of hAdV more rapid and sensitive. Indirect ELISA can detect the IgA, IgM and IgG antibodies of hAdV in human serum or plasma. Immunofluores (IF), latex agglutination test (LAT) and enzyme immunoassay (EIA) are also common diagnostic methods accepted by most clinical laboratories because of their simple and rapid characteristics.\n5.2 Molecular\u2010based approaches for human adenovirus detection\nEmerging molecular\u2010based detection methods have gradually replaced traditional detection technology in many laboratories and clinical practices, providing reliable new methods for the diagnosis of hAdV.60\nSpecific antigenic determinants on the hexon surface of hAdV can be identified by neutralizing antibodies. The antigenic determinants of hexon proteins have two loops, L1 and L2, which are divided into seven hypervariable regions (HVR), among which HVR 1 to 7 has become the newest method of choice for adenovirus typing. Madisch developed a two\u2010step diagnostic method that can classify 51 serotypes by amplification and sequencing of the amplification elements on L1 and L2.37 Shimada studied a more conservative hexon gene on HVR, which can type 44 serotypes, but it is limited to the hAdV serotypes that can lead to corneal conjunctivitis.38 Real\u2010time PCR is a sensitive and quantitative technique to diagnose hAdV infections. A real\u2010time PCR with consensus primer and probe for a conserved region of the hexon gene has been designed to detect 51 prototypes. The sensitivity of the assay is \u226415 copies per run, and the linear range of quantitation was 1.5\u2009\u00d7\u2009101 to 1.5\u2009\u00d7\u2009108 copies/run.39 The RealStar Adenovirus PCR Kit 1.0 is a real\u2010time PCR\u2010based diagnostic test for in vitro detection and quantification of hAdV\u2010specific DNA. Its sensitivity is 1.09 copies/\u03bcL (95%, 0.62\u20103.08 copies/\u03bcL), and it has no cross\u2010reactivity against 35 human viral pathogens. Compared with the RealStar Adenovirus PCR Kit, the in\u2010house qPCR assay is more sensitive and reliable for the detection and quantification of hAdV\u2010specific DNA. The performance characteristics of this in\u2010house qPCR have been evaluated against the RealStar Adenovirus PCR Kit, using 122 clinical specimens and 18 proficiency samples.35 In this study, the in\u2010house hAdV qPCR assay detected six hAdV species A to F, except species G. Using the RealStar Adenovirus PCR Kit as the reference, the sensitivity and specificity are 98.1% and 100%, respectively, for the in\u2010house qPCR assay, and the correlation of the two assays is quite good (R2\u2009=\u20090.984). Furthermore, the in\u2010house qPCR assay has a linear range up to 9 log10 copies/m, and the %CV values suggested quite low intra\u2010/inter\u2010assay variations.6 RHINOVIRUS AND ITS DIAGNOSTIC APPROACHES\nRhinoviruses (RVs) are RNA viruses belonging to the family Picornaviridae genus Enterovirus, which has been classified into 3 species (A to C) with over 160 serotypes.64-67 RVs are small single\u2010stranded RNA viruses with an icosahedral symmetrical capsid.68 RVs are the most frequent cause of respiratory tract infections in both children and adults. RV\u2010A and RV\u2010C are common RV species causing lower airway illness, wheezing and acute asthma, and they can lead to more severe symptoms than RV\u2010B in children.67, 69\nCulture isolation of virus combined with acid stabilization test is a classic method for RV diagnosis. However, this assay is time\u2010consuming and laborious, limiting its value for clinical treatment. Human RV antibodies can be detected by immunological methods, such as the complement fixation test (CFT), HI test, IF, and ELISA. However, owing to the lack of suitable cross\u2010reactive antigens to cover a large number of RV serotypes, the application of these methods is greatly limited. In contrast, the one\u2010step, real\u2010time PCR assay detects RVs by using a sequence detection system. This assay improves workflow, reduces preparation time, and eliminates cross\u2010contamination that might be introduced during cDNA transfer from the reverse transcription reaction into the PCR reaction step.40 Semi\u2010nested RT\u2010PCR assay is based on an extremely sensitive PCR to detect airborne RVs, which has a limit of detection (LOD) of approximately 0.8 median tissue culture infectious dose (TCID50).41 The one\u2010step Panenterhino/Ge/08 real\u2010time RT\u2010RCR assay has been developed and validated by using an internal extraction control and serial dilutions of an in vitro\u2010transcribed rhinovirus RNA reference standard.42 The LOD and limit of quantification (LOQ) of this assay are 3.10\u2009log copies/mL and 4.10\u2009log copies/mL, respectively. The linearity is conserved from 4.10 to 9.10\u2009log copies/mL, and intra\u2010assay reproducibility is r2\u2009=\u20090.999.42 With the rapid development of WGS technology, more and more laboratories may perform WGS on human RV isolates clinically. With the discovery of hRV\u2010C, the data volume of whole\u2010genome hRV sequencing has been increased and improved significantly. This will help researchers and clinicians to understand the evolutionary and recombination of RV,43 which may improve diagnosis.7 MULTIPLEX RESPIRATORY VIRUS DETECTION\nAlthough single respiratory viruses can be detected in patients with symptoms, other respiratory viruses may also exist simultaneously. Children, especially those under 5 years of age, present with a higher frequency of coinfections.70-72 Multiplex assays that contain more than one viral gene target in a single tube have the advantage of rapid detection of several potential viral pathogens simultaneously. Multiplex real\u2010time PCR has allowed simultaneous detection of multiple respiratory viruses in a short time. Compared with the singleplex approach, the multiplex diagnostic approach has higher sample throughput (96 samples per run), shorter turnaround time (5\u2009hours), and a smaller amount of sample requirement.73\nThe Luminex NxTAG Respiratory Pathogen Panel (NxTAG\u2010RPP) is a new high\u2010throughput multiplex real\u2010time PCR system, which was upgraded from the xTAG Respiratory Viral Panel Fastv2 (RVPv2) assay.73 This assay demonstrates good diagnostic performance on detection of multiplex respiratory pathogens. A total of 284 clinical respiratory specimens, including hAdV and RV, and 3 influenza A/H7N9 viral culture samples have been tested, and the overall diagnostic sensitivity of the NxTAG\u2010RPP was 98.9% (95% CI, 97.2 to 99.7), while the specificity was 99.0% (95% CI, 98.6 to 99.2). This assay demonstrated 100% sensitivity for detection of hAdV.73 A number of such assays have been developed, as described, and are summarized in Table 2.\nTable 2.

No cross\u2010reactivity was observed among other common respiratory viruses, and the total detection time of this assay was 2.7\u2009hours for 96 samples.\nThe Panther Fusion respiratory assay has been developed to detect multiple respiratory viruses, and it consists of three multiplex real\u2010time PCR panels: Flu A/B/RSV, Paraflu (Parainfluenza), and hAdV/hMPV/RV.75 The performance characteristics of this assay for the detection of Flu A/B, RSV, Paraflu 1 to 3, hMPV, RV, and hAdV have been evaluated using 395 nasopharyngeal (NP) and 104 lower respiratory tract (LRT) samples.75 The Wilson\u2010126 Score method was used to calculate the 95% CI for positive percent agreement (PPA) and negative percent agreement (NPA). For the NP samples, the Panther Fusion Assay has 100% PPA and 98.4% to 100% NPA for all targets. For the LRT samples, it had 100% PPA for all targets and 100% NPA for all targets, except hMPV (96.1%).75\nFast Track Diagnostics Respiratory pathogens 21 (FTD21 kit) is a commercial multiplex nucleic acid amplification assay. The FTD21 kit has been evaluated using 665 samples from patients with influenza\u2010like illness. This kit has sensitivity of 90.7% and specificity of 100% compared to the RealStar 1.0 kit. In addition, upon modification of the FTD21 kit, the sensitivity increased to 97.3%.76\nA GeXP\u2010based multiplex RT\u2010PCR assay (GeXP assay) has been developed to detect 16 different respiratory viruses simultaneously.77 Seventeen sets of chimeric primers were designed to initiate the RT\u2010PCR, and another pair of universal primers was used for subsequent cycles of RT\u2010PCR.77 The GeXP assay achieves a sensitivity of 20 to 200 copies for a single virus, and when all 16 premixed viral targets were present, the sensitivity was 1000 copies, suggesting that this assay is a sensitive and specific method for detecting respiratory viruses.77\nThe Qiagen ResPlex II V2.0 kit, which uses a target\u2010enriched multiplexing RT\u2010PCR amplification combined with a suspension array detection, detects a total of 17 respiratory viruses, including Flu A/B, PIV 1/2/3/4, RSV, hMPV, rhinoviruses (RVs), enterovirus (EV), human bocavirus (hBoV), hAdV, four coronaviruses (229E, OC43, NL63, and HKU1) and FluA pdm09 from 438 nasopharyngeal swab specimens.78 The specificity of the test was about 92.9% to 100%. The sensitivity for PIV3, hMPV, PIV1 and BoV was reported to be 73.1%, 70%, 66.7%, and 55.6%, respectively, but the sensitivity for FluA, EnV, OC43, RSV and H1N1 was relatively low.78\nThe FilmArray multiplex PCR system is a multiplex PCR panel that can be used to detect 17 viruses, including RSV\u2010A and RSV\u2010B, and 2 bacteria. This platform requires 2 minutes of hands\u2010on time for sample preparation and about 1 hour for device running time. The testing platform integrates cell lysis reagents, DNA/RNA extraction reagents, purification reagents, amplification reagents, and also detection reagents into one pouch.79 After finishing the run, software analyses were performed, and the test results were presented in an integrated table that includes all tested pathogens.79 The studies have revealed the sensitivity to be 86.4% for RSV\u2010A and 100% for RSV\u2010B, and the specificity was 100% for RSV\u2010A and RSV\u2010B compared to a combination reference of eSensor, xTAG, and a laboratory\u2010developed test.78 The sensitivity and specificity were 100% and 99.5% compared to the Prodesse assay.798 CONCLUSIONS\nRespiratory viruses are a major cause of symptomatic respiratory tract infection in all age groups worldwide. Timely and accurate diagnosis of these viruses enables appropriate treatment of infections. Traditional and modern molecular diagnostic approaches with their advantages, disadvantages and principles, are summarized for several common respiratory viruses, such as influenza virus, human RSV, coronavirus, hAdV, and rhinovirus, as discussed in this review. However, these respiratory viruses are prone to antigenic drift caused by point mutations in viral genes, and new strains with pandemic potential may result from gene reassortment. All of these continue to pose new challenges to rapid and accurate detection of respiratory virus infection in humans. Therefore, the identification of mutations within viral genomes is quite essential. However, efforts to pinpoint genetic mutations in human respiratory viruses have relied on high\u2010throughput sequencing of single genes or gene families using Sanger sequencing. Although this approach has been fruitful, the cost and throughput of Sanger sequencing generally prohibits systematic sequencing of the ~22\u2009000 genes that make up the exome. The recent development of NGS technologies changed this paradigm by providing the capability to rapidly sequence exomes, transcriptomes, and genomes at relatively low cost. The application of NGS in diagnosis and identification of respiratory pathogens especially for patients with severe pneumonia or those with unknown origin infections becomes more and more popular. NGS exhibited the ability to detect coinfections in severe pneumonia patients and performed well in diagnosing severe pneumonia compared to conventional methods. As an infrequently circulating genotype, genomic characterization of the whole genome of a viral strain will promote further studies on its epidemiology and pathogenicity, and aid the diagnosis of a new emerging respiratory virus. WGS enables better identification of transmission events and outbreaks, which is not always possible with sub\u2010genomic sequences.ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nThis study was supported by grants from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (81974302 and 81601761), the Program for Youth Talent of Higher Learning Institutions of Hebei Province (BJ2018045), a starting grant from Hebei Agricultural University (ZD2016026 and YJ201843), and Hebei Province's Program for Talents Returning from Studying Overseas (CN201707).CONFLICT OF INTERESTS\nThe authors declare that there are no conflict of interests.AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS\nNZ, LW, XD, RL, MS, CH, YS, and LH drafted the manuscript.
