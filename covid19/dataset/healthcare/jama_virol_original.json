{"jama.2020.3204": "Key Points\nQuestion  What was the initial experience in Singapore with the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)?\nFindings  In this descriptive case series of the first 18 patients diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection in Singapore between January 23 and February 3, 2020, clinical presentation was a respiratory tract infection with prolonged viral shedding from the nasopharynx of 7 days or longer in 15 patients (83%). Supplemental oxygen was required in 6 patients (33%), 5 of whom were treated with lopinavir-ritonavir, with variable clinical outcomes following treatment.\nMeaning  These findings provide clinical features and course among patients diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection in Singapore.\nAbstract\nImportance  Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in Wuhan, China, in December 2019 and has spread globally with sustained human-to-human transmission outside China.\nObjective  To report the initial experience in Singapore with the epidemiologic investigation of this outbreak, clinical features, and management.\nDesign, Setting, and Participants  Descriptive case series of the first 18 patients diagnosed with polymerase chain reaction (PCR)\u2013confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection at 4 hospitals in Singapore from January 23 to February 3, 2020; final follow-up date was February 25, 2020.\nExposures  Confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection.\nMain Outcomes and Measures  Clinical, laboratory, and radiologic data were collected, including PCR cycle threshold values from nasopharyngeal swabs and viral shedding in blood, urine, and stool. Clinical course was summarized, including requirement for supplemental oxygen and intensive care and use of empirical treatment with lopinavir-ritonavir.\nResults  Among the 18 hospitalized patients with PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection (median age, 47 years; 9 [50%] women), clinical presentation was an upper respiratory tract infection in 12 (67%), and viral shedding from the nasopharynx was prolonged for 7 days or longer among 15 (83%). Six individuals (33%) required supplemental oxygen; of these, 2 required intensive care. There were no deaths. Virus was detectable in the stool (4/8 [50%]) and blood (1/12 [8%]) by PCR but not in urine. Five individuals requiring supplemental oxygen were treated with lopinavir-ritonavir. For 3 of the 5 patients, fever resolved and supplemental oxygen requirement was reduced within 3 days, whereas 2 deteriorated with progressive respiratory failure. Four of the 5 patients treated with lopinavir-ritonavir developed nausea, vomiting, and/or diarrhea, and 3 developed abnormal liver function test results.\nConclusions and Relevance  Among the first 18 patients diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection in Singapore, clinical presentation was frequently a mild respiratory tract infection. Some patients required supplemental oxygen and had variable clinical outcomes following treatment with an antiretroviral agent.\nIntroduction\nThe third novel coronavirus in 17 years emerged in Wuhan, China, in December 2019.1 Phylogenetics has indicated that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is closely related to bat-derived SARS-like coronaviruses.2 Early reports from Wuhan described the associated coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) as a SARS-like atypical pneumonia in which 26% to 33% of patients required intensive care and 4% to 15% died.1,3,4 A large case series of 72\u202f314 infected individuals has since refined these initial estimates in China to severe disease in 14% and a case-fatality rate of 2.3%.5\nOn January 23, 2020, the first imported SARS-CoV-2 infection in Singapore was detected in a visitor from Wuhan. Subsequently, COVID-19 has been diagnosed among other visitors and returning travelers, and from limited local transmission.6\nWhile a proven effective antiviral treatment in COVID-19 is not available, the antiretroviral drug lopinavir-ritonavir has been proposed, as its potential effectiveness in the treatment of SARS was suggested in 2 case series.7,8 In Middle East respiratory syndrome, lopinavir-ritonavir also showed potential activity in marmosets,9 but in a mouse model it did not reduce virus titer or lung pathology, although it improved lung function.10\nThis case series describes the epidemiologic features, clinical presentation, treatment, and outcomes of the first 18 patients in Singapore with confirmed COVID-19.\nMethods\nOutbreak Response\nOn January 2, 2020, after first reports of an outbreak of atypical pneumonia in Wuhan, China, the Singapore Ministry of Health issued a health alert that patients with pneumonia and recent travel to Hubei Province should be screened for SARS-CoV-2 infection. All individuals with suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection were isolated with airborne and contact precautions, and attending staff wore personal protective equipment in accordance with the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines.11 Extensive contact tracing followed by quarantine of asymptomatic contacts and hospital isolation and screening of symptomatic contacts was strictly enforced.\nData and Specimen Collection\nIndividuals confirmed to have COVID-19 by SARS-CoV-2 real-time reverse transcriptase\u2013polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) were eligible for inclusion in this study (eMethods in the Supplement). Data were collected at the 4 hospitals that provided care for these patients.\nWaiver of informed consent for collection of clinical data from infected individuals was granted by the Ministry of Health, Singapore, under the Infectious Diseases Act as part of the COVID-19 outbreak investigation. Written informed consent was obtained from study participants for collection of biological samples after review and approval of the study protocol by the institutional ethics committee.\nData from electronic health records were summarized using a standardized data collection form. Two researchers independently reviewed the data collection forms for accuracy.\nSpecimens (blood, stool, and urine samples; nasopharyngeal swabs) were collected at multiple time points in the first 2 weeks following study enrollment and tested by RT-PCR for the presence of SARS-CoV-2. RT-PCR cycle threshold values were collected. The cycle threshold value correlates with the number of copies of the virus in a biological sample, in an inversely proportional and exponential manner. Sequencing of PCR products of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) gene were used to construct phylogenetic trees (eMethods in the Supplement).\nClinical Management\nAs part of standard of care, complete blood cell count, tests of kidney and liver function, and measurement of C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase levels were performed. Respiratory samples were tested for influenza and other respiratory viruses with a multiplex PCR assay.\nAll patients received supportive therapy, including supplemental oxygen when saturations as measured by pulse oximeter dropped below 92%. Patients clinically suspected of having community-acquired pneumonia were administered empirical broad-spectrum antibiotics and oral oseltamivir. Coformulated lopinavir-ritonavir (400 mg/100 mg twice daily orally for up to 14 days) was prescribed to selected patients at the treating physicians\u2019 discretion after shared decision-making and provision of oral informed consent. Corticosteroids were avoided, reflecting increased mortality with their use in severe influenza.12\nRespiratory samples were sent daily for SARS-CoV-2 PCR on clinical recovery. Deisolation was contingent on at least 2 consecutive negative PCR assay results more than 24 hours apart.\nResults\nEpidemiologic Features\nBetween January 23 and February 3, 2020, 18 patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 were diagnosed in Singapore, with symptom onset from January 14 to January 30, 2020. All patients reported travel to Wuhan, China, in the 14 days prior to illness onset (eTable 1 in the Supplement). Four patients (22%) were identified through contact tracing, while 3 (17%) were identified through border screening. Of the 18 patients, 16 (89%) were Chinese nationals, while 2 (11%) were Singapore residents. There were 5 clusters comprising family, traveling companions, or other close contacts (eFigure 1 in the Supplement). Contact tracing of the 18 patients identified a total of 264 close contacts in Singapore (eFigure 2 in the Supplement). As of February 25, 2020, no infections had been detected among health care workers involved in the care of patients with COVID-19.\nClinical Features\nClinical features are summarized in the Table. Fever (13 [72%]), cough (15 [83%]), and sore throat (11 [61%]) were common symptoms. Rhinorrhea was infrequent (1 [6%]), while 6 patients (33%) had an abnormal chest radiograph finding or lung crepitations. No patients presented with a severe acute respiratory distress syndrome, and only 1 required immediate supplemental oxygen. Lymphopenia (<1.1 \u00d7109/L) was present in 7 of 16 patients (39%) and an elevated C-reactive protein level (>20 mg/L) in 6 of 16 (38%), while kidney function remained normal.\nThe clinical course was uncomplicated for 12 patients (67%), but 6 patients (33%) desaturated and required supplemental oxygen (Figure 1). Chest radiographs showed no pulmonary opacities at presentation in 12 patients (67%) and remained clear throughout the acute illness in 9 (50%). Three patients with initially normal chest radiograph findings developed bilateral diffuse airspace opacities; of these, 2 had been persistently febrile for more than 1 week. Two individuals (11%) required admission to the intensive care unit because of increasing supplemental oxygen requirements, and 1 (6%) required mechanical ventilation. No concomitant bacterial or viral infections were detected, and there were no deaths as of February 25, 2020.\nClinical Outcomes\nOf the 6 patients who required supplemental oxygen, 5 received lopinavir-ritonavir (Figure 2). For 3 of 5 patients (60%), initiation of lopinavir-ritonavir was followed by a reduction in supplemental oxygen requirements within 3 days, and viral shedding in nasopharyngeal swabs cleared within 2 days of treatment for 2 of 5 (40%).\nTwo patients, however, deteriorated and experienced progressive respiratory failure while receiving lopinavir-ritonavir, with 1 requiring invasive mechanical ventilation. Virus continued to be detected by nasopharyngeal swab or endotracheal tube aspirate for these 2 patients for the duration of their admission to intensive care.\nFour of the 5 patients treated with lopinavir-ritonavir developed nausea, vomiting, and/or diarrhea, and 3 developed abnormal liver function test results. Only 1 individual completed the planned 14-day treatment course as a result of these adverse events.\nVirologic Features\nMedian duration of viral shedding from first to last positive nasopharyngeal swab collected as part of clinical care was 12 days (range, 1-24), and 15 patients (83%) had viral shedding from the nasopharynx detected for 7 days or longer. Daily serial RT-PCR cycle threshold values for all 18 patients are shown in eFigure 3 in the Supplement. The time course of serial cycle threshold values by day of illness for 12 patients not receiving supplemental oxygen and 6 patients receiving supplemental oxygen (of whom 5 were treated with lopinavir-ritonavir) appeared similar (eFigure 4 in the Supplement).\nVirus was detected by PCR in stool (4/8 patients [50%]) and in whole blood (1/12 [8%]); virus was not detected in urine (0/10 samples) (eTable 2 in the Supplement). Viral culture results were not available at the time of writing to determine the viability of virus detected outside the respiratory tract.\nSequences for phylogenetic analysis were available for 6 viruses (eFigure 5 in the Supplement). All clustered together with other SARS-CoV-2 sequences reported from China and other countries and are available in public databases.\nDiscussion\nThis descriptive case series reports the clinical features of the first 18 patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection in Singapore, reporting epidemiologic features and clinical course in detail.\nPerhaps reflecting the intensive efforts at contact tracing, 28% of patients were without fever vs 1.4% to 17% in 3 previously reported studies from Wuhan, China.1,4,13 In the current study, 6 of 18 patients (33%) experienced oxygen desaturation to 92% or less, in contrast to the 76% to 90% supplemental oxygen use from the other 3 studies.1,4,13\nIn 4 of 8 patients, virus was detected in stool, regardless of diarrhea, over 1 to 7 days. Viremia was detected in 6 patients1 and 1 of 5 patients14 in China but only in 1 of 12 in this study. In the family cluster in Shenzhen, the virus was not detected in urine or stool.14 In SARS, viremia was observed in the first week, with peak respiratory viral shedding in the second week and persistent stool viral shedding beyond the second week.15 In Middle East respiratory syndrome, viral shedding was greater in lower respiratory tract samples than in blood and stool.16 Viral load in nasopharyngeal samples and viremia was associated with disease severity in SARS.17\nIn this study, viral load in nasopharyngeal samples from patients with COVID-19 peaked within the first few days after symptom onset before declining. The duration of viral shedding from nasopharyngeal aspirates was prolonged up to at least 24 days after symptom onset. This was longer than reported from a comparable series from China.18 Toward the end of this period virus was only intermittently detected from nasopharyngeal swabs. It is unclear whether this is attributable to biological differences in the intensity of shedding or to sampling variability when low amounts of virus are present. Determining whether the virus remains transmissible throughout the period of detectability is critical to control efforts.\nFive patients were treated with lopinavir-ritonavir within 1 to 3 days of desaturation, but evidence of clinical benefit was equivocal. While defervescence occurred within 1 to 3 days of lopinavir-ritonavir initiation, it was unable to prevent progressive disease in 2 patients. Decline in viral load as indicated by the cycle threshold value from nasopharyngeal swabs also appeared similar between those treated and not treated with lopinavir-ritonavir. The effectiveness of lopinavir-ritonavir treatment in COVID-19 needs to be examined in an outbreak randomized trial, given a lack of clear signal in this small case series.\nLimitations\nThis study has several limitations. First, it was a case series of 18 patients who acquired their infection following travel to Wuhan, China. Findings from this study are valuable early data from a high-resource setting but may change as this outbreak continues to evolve and local transmission clusters emerge. Second, 9 individuals (50%) presented to the hospital more than 2 days after symptom onset. As a result, sample collection early during the course of illness was limited. Third, biological samples were collected systematically when possible, but not all patients consented to sample collection. Baseline laboratory data were also not available for all patients. Fourth, cycle threshold values are a quantitative measure of viral load, but correlation with clinical progress and transmissibility is not yet known.\nConclusions\nAmong the first 18 patients diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection in Singapore, clinical presentation was frequently a mild respiratory tract infection. Some patients required supplemental oxygen and had variable clinical outcomes following treatment with an antiretroviral agent.\nBack to top\nArticle Information\nCorresponding Authors: Barnaby Edward Young, MB, BChir (Barnaby_young@ncid.sg) and Yee-Sin Leo, MPH (Yee_Sin_Leo@ncid.sg), National Centre for Infectious Diseases, 16 Jln Tan Tock Seng, Singapore 308442.\nAccepted for Publication: February 27, 2020.\nPublished Online: March 3, 2020. doi:10.1001/jama.2020.3204\nCorrection: This article was corrected online on March 20, 2020, for an incorrect medication dose in the text, a typographic error in Figure 1, and an error in the author affiliations.\nAuthor Contributions: Dr Young had full access to all of the data in the study and takes responsibility for the integrity of the data and the accuracy of the data analysis.\nConcept and design: Young, Ong, O.-T.

Most pediatric patients were hospitalized, and symptomatic children received mainly supportive care; no deaths were reported in the age range of 0 to 9 years.\nMeaning  Most children with COVID-19 presented with mild symptoms, if any, generally required supportive care only, and typically had a good prognosis and recovered within 1 to 2 weeks.\nAbstract\nImportance  The current rapid worldwide spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection justifies the global effort to identify effective preventive strategies and optimal medical management. While data are available for adult patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), limited reports have analyzed pediatric patients infected with SARS-CoV-2.\nObjective  To evaluate currently reported pediatric cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection.\nEvidence Review  An extensive search strategy was designed to retrieve all articles published from December 1, 2019, to March 3, 2020, by combining the terms coronavirus and coronavirus infection in several electronic databases (PubMed, Cochrane Library, and CINAHL), and following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses guidelines. Retrospective cross-sectional and case-control studies, case series and case reports, bulletins, and national reports about the pediatric SARS-CoV-2 infection were included. The risk of bias for eligible observational studies was assessed according to the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology reporting guideline.\nFindings  A total of 815 articles were identified. Eighteen studies with 1065 participants (444 patients were younger than\u200910 years, and 553 were aged 10 to 19 years) with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were included in the final analysis. All articles reflected research performed in China, except for 1 clinical case in Singapore. Children at any age were mostly reported to have mild respiratory symptoms, namely fever, dry cough, and fatigue, or were asymptomatic. Bronchial thickening and ground-glass opacities were the main radiologic features, and these findings were also reported in asymptomatic patients. Among the included articles, there was only 1 case of severe COVID-19 infection, which occurred in a 13-month-old infant. No deaths were reported in children aged 0 to 9 years. Available data about therapies were limited.\nConclusions and Relevance  To our knowledge, this is the first systematic review that assesses and summarizes clinical features and management of children with SARS-CoV-2 infection. The rapid spread of COVID-19 across the globe and the lack of European and US data on pediatric patients require further epidemiologic and clinical studies to identify possible preventive and therapeutic strategies.\nIntroduction\nIn late December 2019, the first pneumonia cases of unknown origin were identified in Wuhan, the capital city of Hubei province in central China.1 The causative pathogen has been identified as a novel enveloped RNA betacoronavirus.2 Given the phylogenetic similarity to the previously isolated severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), the new virus has been named SARS-CoV-2.3\nThe World Health Organization declared coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, a pandemic health emergency.4 Person-to-person transmission of SARS-CoV-2 occurs primarily through close contact with an infected person, mainly via respiratory droplets and after touching contaminated objects. Additional routes of transmission are currently under investigation, including fecal viral shedding.5 One of the putative mechanisms of viral entry depends on binding of the viral spike (S) proteins to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 cellular receptors and on S protein priming by the host cellular serine protease TMPRSS2.6 The understanding of the host-virus immunologic interaction is still incomplete.\nThe current rapid worldwide spread of SARS-CoV-2 infection and the severity of some cases of COVID-19 mimicking that of SARS justify the global effort to identify effective preventive strategies and optimal medical management, including the implementation of targeted therapies and vaccine development.\nAt present, defining the clinical characteristics and severity of the disease in large cohorts of patients is an urgent need. While data are available for adult patients with COVID-19, limited reports analyze pediatric patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. In this context, we performed the first systematic review, to our knowledge, of COVID-19 in children and adolescents to evaluate clinical features, diagnostic tests, current therapeutic management, and prognosis.\nMethods\nOutcome\nThe primary outcome of this study was the systematic evaluation and characterization of currently reported pediatric cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection. In particular, the primary analysis focused on age, clinical manifestations, diagnostic and therapeutic management, and prognosis of children with COVID-19.\nSearch Strategy\nAn extensive search strategy was designed to retrieve all articles published from December 1, 2019, to March 3, 2020, combining the generic terms coronavirus and coronavirus infection in key electronic bibliographic databases (PubMed, Cochrane Library, and CINAHL), following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) reporting guideline.7 Search results were compiled using RefWorks software (ProQuest). In keeping with the quality standards for reporting systematic reviews and meta-analysis of observational studies,8 2 independent researchers (R.C. and M.V.) screened retrieved articles. The same investigators independently assessed full texts of records deemed eligible for inclusion. Any discrepancies were resolved by discussion and consensus. Authors of publications reporting unclear data were contacted by email for clarification.\nStudy Selection and Risk of Bias Assessment\nThe risk of bias for eligible observational studies (cross-sectional and case-control) was assessed according to the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) reporting guideline.9 The risk was evaluated using a question tool explicitly designed for this review, which asked (1) Did the patients meet inclusion criteria (0- to 19-year-old participants affected by SARS-CoV-2)? (2) Were the diagnoses free from outcome misclassification? Two investigators (R.C. and M.V.) independently assigned an overall risk of bias to each eligible study, and if they disagreed, a third reviewer (A.L.) was consulted. Studies with risks of bias were excluded. Study inclusion and exclusion criteria are detailed in the Box.\nBox.\nInclusion and Exclusion Criteria\nInclusion criteria\nPopulation: children and adolescents (age \u226419 y) with confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection\nStudy design: retrospective studies (cross-sectional studies, case-control studies, case series, and case reports), bulletins, and national reports\nOutcome: evaluation of clinical symptoms of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19); description of the sources and the possible mechanisms of infection; description of diagnostic tests and therapeutic strategies; patients\u2019 prognosis\nExclusion criteria\nClinical guidelines, consensus documents, clinical trials, reviews, systematic reviews, and conference proceedings\nStudies about other serotypes of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus infection\nData Extraction\nTwo independent reviewers (R.C. and M.V.) extracted data from each eligible study using a standardized data extraction sheet and then proceeded to cross check the results. Disagreements between reviewers regarding extracted data were resolved through discussion and consensus of a third reviewer (A.L.). The following information was extracted: first author name, date of publication, country, type of study (retrospective study, case report, case series), age (0-19 years) and sex of affected children, diagnostic tests (nasopharyngeal swab, chest radiograph, and lung computed tomography [CT]), clinical symptoms, therapies, and prognosis (hospitalization, intensive care unit admission, or death).\nResults\nThe search found 815 articles. After removing 39 duplicates, 776 articles were reviewed based on the title and abstract, and of those, 690 articles were excluded. Eighty-six full texts were assessed for eligibility, with 68 excluded based on article type (reviews, systematic reviews, editorials, guidelines), topic (other viral agents), and population (adult patients with COVID-19). One of these 68 excluded articles was retracted. Eighteen articles met the inclusion criteria and were analyzed for the systematic review (Figure). Included cross-sectional studies showed low risk of bias.\nStudy Characteristics and Demographic Features\nAll the included articles were published in February 2020 except 1 article published in March 2020.10 Seventeen studies were conducted in China10-26 and 1 in Singapore.27 We found a total of 1065 pediatric cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection. All included articles reported the age at onset of the infection. In particular, 444 were cases of children younger than 10 years,11,14-19,22,24,26,27 and 553 were children ranging from age 10 to 19 years.10,13,14,20,24 Two articles described the cases of 2 newborns,15,22 and 5 other articles reported infant cases.10,16-18,27 Twelve articles stated the sex of involved patients,10,11,16-23,26,27 specifically, 24 children were boys, and 32 were girls. Seventeen articles reported that patients had a history of travel in Wuhan, China, or contact with affected family members (Table).10-23,25-27\nClinical Symptoms, Therapeutic Management, and Prognosis\nSixteen articles reported clinical symptoms.10-12,14-23,25-27 Patients were symptomatic in 14 studies,11,12,14-18,20-23,25-27 while 2 articles reported 3 clinical cases of asymptomatic children aged 12, 10, and 7 years.10,19 Fever and cough were the main symptoms, with both reported in 6 of the included studies.11,12,14,23,25,26 Also, fever was a symptom described in 12 articles.11,12,14,16-18,20,21,23,25-27 When reported, respiratory symptoms appeared mild, except for 1 study of a severe SARS-CoV-2 infection in a 13-month-old infant.17 This patient developed vomiting, diarrhea, fever, and pneumonia, complicated by shock with metabolic acidosis and kidney failure that required intensive care and assisted ventilation.17 A history of gastrointestinal symptoms was described in 2 articles, with vomiting the primary clinical manifestation.17,22 We found 2 articles that reported cases of neonatal COVID-19.15,22 One article described a case of a newborn aged 30 hours who acquired SARS-CoV-2 from the mother who had been infected, and the newborn developed mild respiratory distress with abnormal findings at chest radiography.15 The other neonatal case was a 17-day-old infant who developed intermittent vomiting that required intravenous rehydration and supportive care.22\nPatients (both symptomatic and asymptomatic children) were hospitalized.11,12,14,16-23,25-27 Except for the single case of severe infection, none of the included patients required oxygen or assisted ventilation. Five articles reported the administration of treatments to 14 children.11,16,17,22,26 The 3 asymptomatic patients did not require any therapy.10,27 Most included patients needed supportive therapy. In 2 articles, children with pneumonia were treated with antibiotics.16,26 The infant hospitalized in the pediatric intensive care unit for shock and acute kidney failure was successfully treated with an aggressive resuscitation therapy, assisted ventilation, intravenous dopamine, blood transfusion, dialysis, intravenous immunoglobulins, antibiotics (meropenem and linezolid), and oseltamivir.17 In general, included patients had a good prognosis; however, 1 death was reported in the age range of 10 to 19 years.24\nDiagnostic Tests\nIn all included studies, patients underwent the nasopharyngeal swab, which tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. The reason for performing the SARS-CoV-2 molecular test was reported in all articles and included a history of contact with infected parents or other family members and/or with people from Wuhan, China.10-23,25-27\nChildren underwent radiologic tests in 12 articles.11-17,19-22,26 Three articles reported chest CT,13,19,21 3 articles mentioned chest radiographs,15,20,26 and 4 articles reported both imaging tests.11,16,17,22 Radiologic findings differed from article to article and were mainly characterized by bronchial thickening (described in 4 articles),11,16,17,22 ground-glass opacities (reported in 3 articles),12,19,21 or inflammatory lung lesions.15,26\nDiscussion\nThe current rapid worldwide spread of SARS-CoV-2 infection requires continual improvement of knowledge about the epidemiology and clinical characteristics of COVID-19. Since December 2019, when the disease was reported in Wuhan city and quickly spread throughout China, data on the clinical characteristics of the affected patients have been reported mainly from adult patients. At present, only limited reports analyze pediatric patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. In this context, we performed the first systematic review of COVID-19 in children and adolescents to evaluate clinical features, diagnostic tests, current therapeutic management, and prognosis, to our knowledge.\nSeventeen articles reported studies performed in China, and 1 article reported a clinical case from Singapore, 1 of the countries with the highest number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in the Western Pacific Region after the Republic of Korea and Japan.28 Although SARS-CoV-2 infection is currently spread throughout China and has widely diffused across other countries, complete reports on pediatric cases are still lacking. Generally, clinical data from affected Chinese adult patients have been available since January 2020, but pediatric retrospective studies and case reports were not published before February 2020, to our knowledge.\nThis systematic review of pediatric cases of COVID-19 shows that most children and adolescents who were infected by SARS-CoV-2 (ie, tested positive by nasopharyngeal swab) presented with mild symptoms.29-31 Frequent clinical manifestations included fever, dry cough, and fatigue accompanied by other upper respiratory symptoms, such as nasal congestion and runny nose.31 Moreover, the main gastrointestinal symptoms were nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, which were reported in a few cases, particularly in a newborn and infants.31 In our analysis, only 1 pediatric case presented with severe lower respiratory tract infection (COVID-19 pneumonia), complicated by shock and kidney failure, and fortunately, it was successfully treated with intensive care.17 Unlike adults,32-34 children do not seem to be at higher risk of severe illness based on age and sex. However, at present, no data are available on the role of comorbidities in the severity of pediatric COVID-19.\nIn general, pediatric patients with COVID-19 had a good prognosis and recovered within 1 to 2 weeks after disease onset, and cases of pediatric death from COVID-19 were not reported in the age range of 0 to 9 years. One death was reported in the age range of 10 to 19 years, but no more information was provided about this patient.24,35 Our results confirmed the current knowledge about the disease severity of COVID-19 in children.29-31,35\nIt is worth noting that COVID-19 infection might affect newborns who acquired the infection from the mother, suggesting a possible perinatal-peripartum transmission.15 However, Chen et al36 recently reported 9 cases of pregnant women with COVID-19 who underwent cesarean delivery, without transmitting COVID-19 to their infants. In addition, viral infections might be acquired during vaginal delivery or through postpartum breastfeeding, but respiratory viruses, including Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus and SARS, did not show infection through vertical (intrauterine) and peripartum transmission or through breastfeeding.15,37\nFor COVID-19, there continue to be conflicting data as to the role of breastfeeding on transmitting neonatal-maternal infection. UNICEF recommends continuing with breastfeeding, while applying necessary precautions to prevent transmission of infection.38 In contrast, the Chinese Working Group for the Prevention and Control of Neonatal SARS-CoV-2 Infection recommends milk formula for every child of a mother who has been infected.39\nOur analysis showed that pediatric patients acquired infections mainly through close contact with their parents or other family members who lived in Wuhan, China, or had traveled there.19,31 This finding aligns with results of a February 2020 report by Wang et al,40 in which 31 patients, all pediatric, and all from provinces in Northern China, underwent nasopharyngeal swab to detect SARS-CoV-2 in respiratory secretions. Furthermore, the nasopharyngeal swab was performed in asymptomatic children with a history of contact with infected family members.40 In our analysis, we included 3 cases of asymptomatic patients who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by nasopharyngeal swab, as part of an effort to perform a history of close contact with infected people.\nRemarkably, in another recent article, Xu et al5 reported that 8 pediatric patients tested positive on rectal swabs, even after nasopharyngeal testing was negative, suggesting viral shedding through gastrointestinal tract and the possibility of fecal-oral viral transmission. However, these preliminary results need to be confirmed by larger studies. Of note, no patients included in our analysis underwent rectal swab.\nRecently, the group study at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health showed that children are at similar risk of infection as the general population, although they are less likely to have severe symptoms. This finding should be considered in analyses of transmission and control.41 These preliminary data, coupled with our results, may suggest that children, even when presenting with mild symptoms or are asymptomatic, might be a source of viral transmission.19,31 This underscores the importance of extensive preventive strategies that include quarantining and limitation of playing and school activities. Further studies focused on the pediatric population are needed to confirm this hypothesis.\nChen et al31 report that the main radiologic features are bronchial thickening, ground-glass opacity, or inflammatory lung lesions, suggestive of pneumonia. These pulmonary findings were also found in patients with mild symptoms or who were asymptomatic, suggesting that COVID-19 induces a primary inflammation of lower respiratory tract airways.29 Although mild respiratory symptoms were mainly reported, several patients underwent chest CT. Currently, there are no studies that compare the chest radiograph with CT or other radiologic tests (lung ultrasonography) to assess COVID-19 in children, to our knowledge.31 Biologic effects of ionizing radiations are widely known; therefore, pediatricians should evaluate and choose the best radiologic options based on clinical conditions and possible adverse events.\nData about therapies were quite limited. Patients with mild respiratory symptoms, pneumonia, and fever were treated with antibiotics and supportive care. Except for the infant hospitalized in the pediatric intensive care unit, none of the patients required oxygen therapy. Currently, many therapeutic questions in children with COVID-19 remain unanswered, so in the interim, pediatric knowledge stems from the management of other respiratory infectious diseases.31,42,43\nLimitations and Strengths\nThis study has several limitations. First, the research occurred over a brief 3-month period. Second, nearly all the articles came from Chinese reports, as European and US studies in children with COVID-19 were not available, to our knowledge, at the time this review was conducted. As a result, we could not assess possible clinical, diagnostic, and therapeutic differences, and compare pediatric results with data from adults with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Third, we were unable to evaluate any possible correlation between viral burden and clinical symptoms. Fourth, the included studies were observational designs, and many were simple case series or case reports.\nA key strength of this systematic review is the absence of population bias (all patients tested positive for SARS-CoV-2). Also, to our knowledge, this is the first systematic review that summarized the current evidence on new SARS-CoV-2 infection in children, clarifying the clinical and therapeutic lack of knowledge.\nConclusions\nThis systematic review assesses and summarizes clinical features and management of children with COVID-19. Currently, the majority of evidence results from studies and clinical cases from China, where the outbreak of COVID-19 first started. Children mainly acquire SARS-CoV-2 infection from their family members but seem to experience less severe COVID-19 than adults, presenting mild symptoms, if any, good prognosis, and recovering within 1 to 2 weeks after disease onset. The quick worldwide spread of SARS-CoV-2 infection and the lack of European and US data on pediatric patients require further epidemiologic and clinical studies to identify possible preventive and therapeutic strategies.\nBack to top\nArticle Information\nCorresponding Author: Amelia Licari, MD, Pediatric Clinic, Fondazione IRCCS Policlinico San Matteo, University of Pavia, Piazzale C.

We review the basics of coronaviruses, with a focus on COVID-19, along with their effects on the cardiovascular system.\nObservations  Coronavirus disease 2019 can cause a viral pneumonia with additional extrapulmonary manifestations and complications. A large proportion of patients have underlying cardiovascular disease and/or cardiac risk factors. Factors associated with mortality include male sex, advanced age, and presence of comorbidities including hypertension, diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular diseases, and cerebrovascular diseases. Acute cardiac injury determined by elevated high-sensitivity troponin levels is commonly observed in severe cases and is strongly associated with mortality. Acute respiratory distress syndrome is also strongly associated with mortality.\nConclusions and Relevance  Coronavirus disease 2019 is associated with a high inflammatory burden that can induce vascular inflammation, myocarditis, and cardiac arrhythmias. Extensive efforts are underway to find specific vaccines and antivirals against SARS-CoV-2. Meanwhile, cardiovascular risk factors and conditions should be judiciously controlled per evidence-based guidelines.\nIntroduction\nCoronaviruses (CoVs) are single-stranded positive-sense RNA viruses, with the capacity for rapid mutation and recombination. Coronaviruses are known to cause respiratory or intestinal infections in humans and animals.1 Acute respiratory infections, including influenza, respiratory syncytial virus, and bacterial pneumonias, are well-recognized triggers for cardiovascular diseases (CVD),2,3 and the underlying CVD is usually associated with comorbidities, which may increase the incidence and severity of infectious diseases.4 The emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus, which causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has rapidly grown into a pandemic, and a large proportion of affected patients have been reported to have underlying CVD.5,6 In this report, we briefly review the basics of coronaviruses and their potential effects on the cardiovascular system. Our knowledge of COVID-19 is still evolving rapidly, and this review discusses previous learnings from outbreaks of SARS and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), as well as seasonal influenza, to obtain further insight into effects of coronaviruses on the cardiovascular system. Understanding the effects of COVID-19 on the cardiovascular system is essential for providing comprehensive medical care for cardiac patients.\nCoronaviruses in Humans\nCoronaviruses are named for crownlike spikes on their surface and belong to the Coronavirinae subfamily, which are further classified into 4 groups: the \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3, and \u03b4 CoVs by phylogenetic clustering, of which \u03b1 and \u03b2 are known to cause infection in humans.7 Coronaviruses contain 4 major structural proteins: the spike (S) protein (which mediates attachment to the host receptor and subsequent fusion of the virus and cell membrane), the nucleocapsid (N) protein, the membrane (M) protein, and the envelope (E) protein.8\nThe first human CoV (HCoV) was identified in the mid-1960s in human embryonic tracheal organ cultures, and until 2003, only 2 HCoV species, HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, were recognized. Currently, 7 different CoV strains are known to infect humans, including HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63, HCoV-OC43, and HCoV-HKU1, which generally cause self-resolving infection. There are also severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and newly identified SARS-CoV-2, which can cause lethal respiratory infections in humans.9,10\nEndemic Coronaviruses\nFour HCoV types, including HCoV-229E (\u03b1-CoV), HCoV-NL63 (\u03b1-CoV), HCoV-OC43 (\u03b2-CoV), and HCoV-HKU1 (\u03b2-CoV) are endemic in humans and usually cause mild, self-limiting respiratory infections, which account for 15% to 30% of common colds.11 Infection with these HCoVs typically cause mild upper respiratory infections in young adults but may lead to hospitalization in elderly patients with underlying cardiac and lung disease.12 Typically, coronaviruses account for a small percentage of patients hospitalized for acute respiratory illness.13\nSevere Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus\nThe SARS-CoV outbreak began in the Guangdong Province in southern China in November 2002, and was most likely linked to a zoonotic event in the wild-animal markets in China. Soon after the isolation of SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV\u2013like viruses were found in Himalayan palm civets and raccoon dogs, with 99.8% nucleotide homology to human SARS-CoV.14\nThe SARS-CoV belongs to the \u03b2-CoVs group and binds to the zinc peptidase angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a surface molecule that is localized on the endothelial cells of arteries and veins, arterial smooth muscle, respiratory tract epithelium, epithelia of the small intestine, respiratory tract epithelium, and immune cells, to enter the host cell.15-17 Suppression of ACE2 expression during SARS-CoV infection has been proposed to play a role in the pathologic changes in the lung and contribute to the severe pneumonia and acute lung failure observed with this virus.18\nFurther studies of wild animals proved robust evidence that SARS-CoV might have originated in bats, when a SARS-like CoV was identified in Chinese horseshoe bats with a sequence similarity of 87% to 92% with human SARS-CoV, and it is believed that palm civets and raccoon dogs provided the intermediate amplification host for SARS-CoV before transmitting it to animal handlers in the animal market.14 Transmission of SARS-CoV is primarily from person-to-person close contact, via respiratory droplets, with an incubation period of 2 to 11 days after exposure.11 The SARS-CoV may be shed into the environment and transferred from environmental surfaces to the hands of patients and health care clinicians. Transmission of infection could be facilitated through contact with the nose, eyes, or mouth.19,20 The ability of an infected patient to transmit the virus to other individuals is assessed by R0 (ie, R naught: basic reproduction number).21 The estimated R0 for SARS-CoV is about 3, which means that each person with SARS-CoV is expected to infect 3 other persons in a susceptible population (Table 1).22\nIn 2003, a total of 8096 people in 29 countries were reported ill with SARS and 774 of them died (around 10%). In the United States, there were 8 laboratory-confirmed and an additional 19 probable SARS cases, with no causal fatalities. The global SARS outbreak cost the world around $40 billion over a period of 6 months.23,24 Currently, there is no vaccine or specific antiviral effective against SARS-CoV. Therefore, treatment of SARS entailed supportive care and use of broad-spectrum antimicrobial coverage to treat secondary bacterial infection. Advanced age (especially older than 60 years), underlying comorbidities (such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, cancer, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), and high-lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) at presentation were independent predictive factors of mortality in SARS-CoV infection.25 Of note, during the SARS outbreak, there was not a significant increase in morbidity or mortality in infants and children.14\nCardiovascular Complications of SARS\nThe SARS-CoV also may have also resulted in cardiovascular complications, although most of the data have been anecdotal in the absence of systematic studies. Acute coronary syndrome and myocardial infarction were noted to occur after SARS.26,27 In a limited study of 75 patients hospitalized with SARS, acute myocardial infarction (AMI) was the cause of death in 2 of 5 fatal cases.26 Findings from this limited study have not been confirmed in other reports. A small prospective study among 46 patients with established clinical diagnosis of SARS and without preexisting cardiac disease collected information at the acute stage of infection (baseline) and 30 days later and showed no significant change in systolic function.28 However, transient diastolic function was detected during SARS infection which was resolved on follow up.28\nIn another study of 121 patients (mean [SD] age of 37.5 [13.2] years; 36% men) with a diagnosis of SARS, in whom 12 patients had underlying cardiovascular disease, tachycardia was the most common finding (72%), and other complications were hypotension (50%), bradycardia (15%), transient cardiomegaly (11%), and transient paroxysmal atrial fibrillation in only 1 patient.29 Most of these patients were asymptomatic, and these conditions were mostly self-limiting.\nA study from Singapore27 reported postmortem examinations in 8 patients who died from SARS in which 4 patients had pulmonary thromboemboli and 3 patients had deep vein thrombosis. One patient had subendocardial infarction with occlusive coronary disease (who had AMI on presentation with SARS). One patient had marantic 5- to 12-mm valvular vegetations involving the mitral, tricuspid, and aortic valves, along with infarction in heart, kidneys, spleen, and brain.27 The presence of pulmonary embolism (PE) and deep vein thrombosis and AMI are of great clinical interest, but the generalizability of this limited study is not established.\nMiddle East Respiratory Syndrome\nThe MERS-CoV epidemic emerged in Saudi Arabia in June 2012.30 The virus transmitted from infected dromedary camels, as the intermediate host, to humans through close contact. It is believed that in the distant past, the MERS-CoV may have originated in bats and transmitted to dromedary camels.30,31 Middle East respiratory syndrome CoV belongs to the \u03b2-CoVs group and use a serine peptidase, dipeptidyl peptidase 4, as the receptor to enter the host cell.15 Middle East respiratory syndrome CoV spreads from an infected person\u2019s respiratory secretions to others through close contact, with an incubation period of 2 to 13 days.11,32 Middle East respiratory syndrome CoV is likely shed into the environment and transferred from environmental surfaces to hands, which then could cause infection through contact with the nose, eyes, or mouth in patients similar to SARS-CoV.19\nAs of November 30, 2019, a total of 2494 laboratory-confirmed infections of MERS-CoV have been reported, with 858 associated deaths (case-fatality rate: 34.4%) in 26 countries, with most cases from Saudi Arabia, with 2102 cases with a case-fatality rate of 37.1%.33 The estimated R0 of MERS-CoV outbreaks in Saudi Arabia and South Korea were between 2 to 5, which means that each person with MERS-CoV is expected to infect 2 to 5 other people in a totally susceptible population.34 The clinical risk factors for mortality in MERS were older age, male sex, and underlying medical conditions including diabetes mellitus, cardiac diseases, chronic kidney disease, respiratory disease, hypertension, and cancer.35,36 A systematic analysis of 637 MERS-CoV patients showed that 30% of cases had underlying cardiac diseases, 50% had hypertension, 50% had diabetes, and 16% had obesity.37\nSevere Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2, Causing COVID-19\nOn December 31, 2019, several local health facilities reported clusters of pneumonia of unknown etiology that were epidemiologically linked to a large seafood and live-animal market in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China. On January 9, 2020, a novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, initially named as 2019-nCoV, was officially identified as the cause of an outbreak of viral pneumonia. This viral pneumonia disease was named COVID-19.38 Severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV-2 belongs to the \u03b2-CoVs group that has 89% nucleotide identity with bat SARS-like CoVZXC21 and 82% with that human SARS-CoV, and similar to SARS-CoV, uses ACE2 as the receptor to enter the host cell.39,40 The SARS-CoV-2 is less genetically similar to MERS-CoV (around 50% nucleotide identity).41 The SARS-CoV-2 infection causes a severe respiratory illness with many epidemiologic, clinical, radiologic, and laboratory findings similar to SARS-CoV infection in 2003.42 Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 seems to be primarily from person to person via close contact, through respiratory droplets, with a mean incubation period of 5.2 days (95% CI, 4.1-7.0 days), with the 95th percentile of the distribution at 12.5 days.42,43 Another study estimated the incubation period to be up to 14 days (ranges from 2-14 days).44\nThere is some concern about a possible fecal-oral route of transmission for SARS-CoV-2 because patients with SARS and MERS frequently had diarrhea, and SARS-CoV RNA was detected in stools of patients with SARS.45 Gastrointestinal symptoms, such as diarrhea, abdominal pain, and vomiting, have been reported in 2% to 10% of patients with COVID-19,45 and a March 2020 report46 from a US patient showed positive stool test for SARS-CoV-2.\nAs of March 19, 2020, there have been 213\u202f254 confirmed cases of COVID-19 reported worldwide, with 8843 fatalities.47 The estimated R0 of SARS-CoV-2 is between 2 and 3, which means that each person with SARS-CoV-2 infection is expected to infect 2 to 3 other people in a susceptible population.43,48 For comparison purposes, the average R0 for seasonal influenza is around 1.3.49\nThe SARS-CoV-2 infection primarily affects adults, with fewer cases reported in children of 15 years or younger.43,50,51 As of March 3, 2020, per World Health Organization Director-General's opening remarks, the global mortality rate has been about 3.4%. The overall crude fatality rate varies by location, intensity of transmission, and variations of care. The nationwide mortality rate in China has been around 3.8% (5.8% in Wuhan; 0.7% other areas in China).52 In 1099 laboratory-confirmed cases, the overall mortality rate was 1.4%.53 In China, the overall crude fatality rate was higher in the early stages of the outbreak and has decreased over time (to 0.7% for patients with symptom onset after February 1, 2020), which could possibly be owing to evolution in patients\u2019 standard of care.52 A different method of mortality estimation using the number of death divided by the number of cases diagnosed 14 days prior (ie, the incubation period) yields a global mortality rate of 5.7%.54 Of note, owing to presence of undiagnosed asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic cases, the full denominator remains unknown. However, the mortality rate is higher in Italy (about 8%), while it is much lower in South Korea (about 0.6%). It is not known whether these difference are due to higher percentage of older patients in Italy, widespread testing in South Korea that increases the denominator by including more asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic low-risk patients, or other undetermined factors. The overall symptomatic secondary attack rate (the rate of transmitting the disease to close contacts) in patients with COVID-19 is 0.45% for close contacts and 10.5% for household members.55\nThe 3 primary symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, cough, and shortness of breath. Less common symptoms are muscle pain, anorexia, malaise, sore throat, nasal congestion, dyspnea, and headache. Symptoms may appear in as few as 2 days or as long as 14 days after exposure.56 The detected viral load is similar in the asymptomatic and symptomatic patients with COVID-19, which suggests potential transmission of the virus from asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic patients to other persons.57 Higher viral loads were detected early after symptom onset, and viral loads were higher in the nose compared with the throat.57 In the United States, diagnosis is currently through SARS-CoV-2 real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction diagnostic panel using upper and lower respiratory specimens.56 New serologic tests, at-home test kits, and point-of-care tests are likely to become available in the near future. Simultaneous coinfection with other respiratory viruses has been reported.58\nChest computed tomography scan has been widely used to further assess patients with COVID-19. Early evidence suggests that initial chest computed tomography shows an abnormality in at least 85% of patients, with 75% of patients having a bilateral lung involvement that most often manifests as subpleural and peripheral areas of ground-glass opacity and consolidation.59\nPresentation Features of COVID-19\nIn a large study53 of 1099 hospitalized and outpatient laboratory-confirmed patients with COVID-19, the median age was 47 years, 41.9% were women, and the most common symptoms were fever (43.8% on admission and 88.7% during admission) and cough (67.8%). Diarrhea was present in 3.8%. The median incubation period was 4 days, with interquartile range of 2 to 7 days. Pulmonary ground-glass opacity was seen in 56.4% on computed tomography scan.53 Computed tomography did not show any significant abnormality in 17.9% of nonsevere and 2.9% of severe cases. Lymphocytopenia (83.2%), thrombocytopenia (36.2%), and leukopenia (33.7%) were frequently observed in patients on admission. The most common comorbidities among these patients include hypertension (14.9%), diabetes (7.4%), and coronary heart disease (2.5%).53 Median length of hospital stay was 12 days (interquartile range, 10-14). Severe illness happened in 15.7% of patients after admission to a hospital, 5% were admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU), 2.3% were intubated, and 1.4% died. The most common significant complications were acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in 3.4% (1.1% in nonsevere cases and 15.6% in severe cases) and septic shock in 1.1% (0.1% in nonsevere cases and 6.4% in severe cases).53\nPreliminary reports from 4226 patients with COVID-19 in the United States indicate that the highest fatality is seen in persons 85 years and older (10% to 27%), followed by persons aged 65 to 84 years (3% to 11%), persons aged 55 to 64 years (1% to 3%), and persons aged 20 to 54 years (<1%), with no fatalities among persons 19 years and younger.60 However, hospitalization and ICU admission rates do not follow this pattern and are fairly common in younger age strata, and (in contrast to the earlier reports from China) 20% of deaths occurred among adults aged 20 to 64 years, and 20% of those hospitalized were aged 20 to 44 years.60\nComorbidities in Patients With COVID-19\nIn a series of 44\u202f672 confirmed patients with COVID-19 from China (which included mild cases),61 4.2% were reported to have CVD and 12.8% had hypertension (while 53% of cases had missing data on comorbid conditions). In this population, 80.9% were reported to have mild disease with no mortality, 13.8% had severe disease with no mortality, and 4.7% had critical disease with a case fatality rate of 49%.61 The prevalence of CVD in different disease severity categories was not reported. The COVID-19 mortality rose with advanced age, with case-fatality rate of 1.3% in patients aged 50 to 59 years, 3.6% in patients aged 60 to 69 years, 8% in patients aged 70 to 79 years, and 14.8% in patients 80 years or older.61 Patients with CVD composed 4.2% of confirmed cases yet made up 22.7% of all fatal cases, with a case fatality rate of 10.5%.61 The case fatality rate for patients with hypertension was 6%, diabetes was 7.3%, and in chronic respiratory disease was 6.3%.61 Coronavirus disease 2019 almost equally infects both sexes; however, men showed a higher case fatality rate than women (3.6% vs 1.6%, respectively). The overall case fatality rate in this study was 2.3%.61 The high percentage of missing data (53%) in this study can affect the described prevalence and case fatality ratios.\nIn a single-center study10 among 99 patients (mean age of 55.5 years; 67% men) with COVID-19, 40% of patients had underlying cardiovascular or cerebrovascular disease. In another study50 of 41 admitted hospital patients (median age of 49 years; 73% men) with COVID-19, 32% of patients had underlying diseases, including cardiovascular disease (15%), hypertension (15%), and diabetes (20%). The most common COVID-19\u2013related complications were ARDS (29%), viremia (15%), acute cardiac injury determined by elevated high-sensitivity troponin (12%), and secondary infection (10%).50 In this study,50 a wide array of plasma inflammatory biomarkers were elevated in both ICU patients and non-ICU patients compared with healthy adults, which provides further evidence for presence of cytokine storm that can further contribute to complications.50\nIn another study62 in 138 hospitalized patients with COVID-19, 36 (26.1%) were transferred to the ICU owing to complications, including ARDS (61%), arrhythmias (44%), and shock (31%). Sixty-four patients (46.4%) had 1 or more comorbidities including hypertension (31%), diabetes (10%), cardiovascular disease (14.5%), and malignant neoplasms (7.2%).62\nFactors Associated With Mortality in COVID-19\nIn 52 critically ill patients with COVID-19 who were admitted to the ICU, mean age was 59.7 years, and the mortality rate was 61.5% by 28 days.51 Three patients from primary population had a fatal cardiac arrest before getting included in this study. The overall rate of comorbidities among the 2 groups of survivors (n\u2009=\u200920) vs nonsurvivors (n\u2009=\u200932) was 40% (20% vs 53%), with CVD (20% vs 53%), chronic cardiac disease (10% vs 9%) and cerebrovascular disease (0% vs 22%) accordingly.51 Most critical patients showed signs of organ function damage, including ARDS in 67%, acute kidney injury in 29%, cardiac injury in 23%, liver dysfunction in 29%, and pneumothorax in 2%. Cardiac injury was defined as an elevated serum level of high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I (hs-TnI) greater than the upper limit of the reference range (>28 pg/mL), which was increased in 15% of survivors and 28% of nonsurvivors. Older age (>65 years), comorbidities, and ARDS were factors associated with death.51\nIn a series of 191 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19, 54 died and 137 survived.63 The odds of death increased with age, Sequential Organ Failure Assessment, and high D-dimer levels on admission. The median duration of viral shedding was 20 days in survivors (interquartile range, 17-24 days). Fatal cases showed a higher rate of comorbidities including hypertension (48% vs 23%), diabetes (31% vs 14%), and coronary heart disease (24% vs 1%) when compared with survivors, respectively.63 The high-sensitivity troponin and inflammatory biomarkers (ie, interleukin-6 and serum ferritin) were higher in nonsurvivors. Nonsurvivors showed higher rates of heart failure (52% vs 12%) and acute cardiac injury (59% vs 1%) than survivors.63\nAnother small retrospective study64 of 150 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 evaluated the factors associated with mortality. Cardiovascular disease was more prevalent in patients who died (13 of 68) than patients who survived (0 of 82). Among the 68 fatal cases, 36 died of respiratory failure, 5 died of myocardial damage and circulatory failure, 22 died of both causes, and 5 died from undetermined causes.64 Patients who died had higher levels of troponin, myoglobin, C-reactive protein, serum ferritin, and interleukin-6. This study is further suggestive of a high inflammatory burden in COVID-19 and a possible rise in myocarditis-related cardiac events.64\nImportance of Myocarditis in COVID-19\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome CoV-2 appears to affect the myocardium and cause myocarditis.65 Sporadic autopsy cases suggest infiltration of myocardium by interstitial mononuclear inflammatory cells.65 In parallel, cases of severe myocarditis with reduced systolic function have been reported after COVID-19.66,67 Cardiac biomarker studies suggest a high prevalence of cardiac injury in hospitalized patients.65,68,69 Myocardial injury is likely associated with infection-related myocarditis and/or ischemia and is an important prognostic factor in COVID-19.\nShi et al68 reported the importance of cardiac injury in COVID-19 mortality in 416 patients hospitalized with COVID-19, of whom 57 died. In these patients, 10.6% had coronary heart disease, 4.1% had heart failure, and 5.3% had cerebrovascular disease. Approximately 20% of patients had cardiac injury defined as hs-TNI greater than the 99% percentile upper reference limit. Patients with elevated hs-TNI were older, had more comorbidities, and had higher levels of leukocytes, N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptides, C-reactive protein, and procalcitonin, but lower lymphocyte counts.68 Patients with cardiac injury had a higher incidence of ARDS (58.5% vs 14.7%; P\u2009<\u2009.001) and a higher mortality rate (51.2% vs 4.5%; P\u2009<\u2009.001) than those without cardiac injury. In multivariable adjusted models, cardiac injury and ARDS were significantly and independently associated with mortality, with hazard ratios of 4.26 and 7.89, respectively.68\nSimilarly, Guo et al69 reported factors associated with outcomes in 187 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 (43 died; 144 discharged) in Wuhan, China. In this study, 35% had underlying CVD (hypertension, coronary heart disease, or cardiomyopathy), and 28% showed evidence of acute myocardial injury (defined as elevated troponin T [TnT] greater than the 99th percentile upper limit).69 Mortality was significantly higher in individuals with high TnT vs those with normal TnT levels (59.6% vs 8.9%, respectively; P\u2009<\u2009.001). Patients with high TnT levels were older, more likely to be men, and had higher comorbidities including hypertension, coronary heart disease, cardiomyopathy, and chronic kidney disease. Patients with high TNT levels also had higher leukocyte counts, lower lymphocyte counts, and higher levels of D-dimer, C-reactive protein, procalcitonin, and N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptides.69 As for outcomes, patients with a high TNT level showed higher incidence of complications such as ARDS, malignant arrhythmias, acute renal injury, and acute coagulopathy. Copresence of CVD and elevated TnT was associated with the highest mortality rate in this group while patients without an elevated TnT, even in presence of CVD, had a lower mortality risk. Although more patients were using ACE inhibitor and angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) medications (owing to their baseline CVD) in the high TnT group, their use was not associated with patients\u2019 mortality rate.69\nImplications\nCurrently, COVID-19 has reached a pandemic level and is a threat to global health. Its course is still evolving, and it is too early to predict its trajectory over the next few months or years.\nLessons from the previous coronavirus and influenza epidemics suggest that viral infections can trigger acute coronary syndromes,3,70 arrhythmias,71 and development of exacerbation of heart failure,72 primarily owing to a combination of a significant systemic inflammatory response plus localized vascular inflammation at the arterial plaque level along with other effects (Figure).3,73-75 Coronavirus disease 2019 may either induce new cardiac pathologies and/or exacerbate underlying cardiovascular diseases. The severity, extent, and short-term vs long-term cardiovascular effects of COVID-19, along with the effect of specific treatments are not yet known, and are subject to close scrutiny and investigation.\nImportantly, during most influenza epidemics, more patients die of cardiovascular causes than pneumonia-influenza causes.76 Given the high inflammatory burden of COVID-19,50 and based on early clinical reports, significant cardiovascular complications with COVID-19 infection are expected. The prevalence of CVD in ambulatory, nonhospitalized cases, and milder cases of COVID-19 is likely lower.\nUnlike influenza, COVID-19 shows a low incidence of severe cases in young children.5 This is either owing to possible resistance to infection in the young (with very important clinical and epidemiologic implications) or owing to very mild symptoms in them (with implications for estimating the size of the denominator of the whole population).5 To date, advanced age (>60 years), male sex, and presence of comorbidities are known to be the major risk factors for COVID-19 mortality.5 Presence of cardiac injury (defined by elevated troponin levels), myocarditis, and ARDS are other strong and independent factors associated with mortality.64,68,69\nMost available reports are primarily from China, where the smoking rate in the adult male population is very high (more than 50% in men and less than 3% in women), and it is not known whether the observed sex differences are primarily owing to disproportionate rate of smoking between genders or is associated with different immune responses or other factors.\nThe exact clinical course, severity, and complications of COVID-19 are not yet completely determined. In the latest report from China, 81% of infections were classified as mild, 14% as severe, and only 5% as critical.77 Critical cases are defined as having respiratory failure, septic shock, and/or multiple organ dysfunction or failure (with fatal cases reported only in the last group).77 It is reasonable to expect that severe and critical cases have more severe effects on the cardiovascular system owing to more robust inflammatory response. At this early stage, our knowledge is mainly based on available numerators data, and the exact population-level denominators are not known. Also, it is likely that the asymptomatic and mildly symptomatic cases are missing from most reports, which further skews our understanding of the disease.\nAt a population level, large-scale public health interventions with preparedness plans and mitigation interventions are being developed and implemented. Public health measures, such as self-isolation and quarantining the infected patients as well as early detection of the disease, are critical for containing and treating the disease. Aggressive compliance with basic hygiene skills along with minimizing the exposure to SARS-CoV-2 is key to preventing COVID-19 and should be strongly implemented. Strict adherence to universal precaution measures is crucial in health care settings. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends using standard precautions, contact precautions, and eye protection when caring for patients with confirmed or possible COVID-19. Airborne precautions are particularly recommended for procedures in which aerosolized particles might be induced.\nUntil specific and effective antiviral therapies against SARS-CoV-2 become available, the treatment of COVID-19 will be primarily based on supportive care and treatment of complications. Treatment of cardiovascular complications should be based on optimal and judicious use of guideline-based therapies. As with other triggers for acute CVD events, the use of antiplatelet agents, \u03b2-blockers, ACE inhibitors, and statins are recommended per practice guidelines. Hypothetically, statins can curb systemic inflammation, help further stabilize the plaques, and prevent a viral-induced plaque destabilization, which can lead to acute coronary syndromes. The cytokine storm associated with COVID-19 likely plays a role in the development of ARDS and fulminant myocarditis and using immunomodulators to curtail this hyperinflammatory response might be beneficial in reducing mortality.\nExtensive research is underway to develop vaccines and antivirals to control COVID-19. Remdesivir is a promising investigational nucleotide analog with broad-spectrum antiviral activity, which along with chloroquine, has been effective in inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 in vitro.78 Originally developed to treat Ebola, for which it was not particularly effective, remdesivir is currently being tested in both mild to moderate (NCT04252664) and severe COVID-19 (NCT04257656). The Adaptive COVID-19 Treatment Trial sponsored by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases has started enrolling patients, with remdesivir (vs placebo) as the first drug in the trial (NCT04280705). This adaptive trial conducts series of 2-arm comparisons between different therapeutic agents vs a placebo. Interim analyses will introduce new arms and permit early stopping for futility, efficacy, or safety. Once a therapy is found to be efficacious, that treatment will then become the control arm for comparison(s) with additional experimental treatment(s).\nA small, limited, single-arm French study79 has tested the effect of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin on the respiratory viral loads in patients with COVID-19. Twenty patients received hydroxychloroquine and 16 untreated patients from another center or cases refusing the protocol were included as controls. Six patients in the hydroxychloroquine arm also received azithromycin for superimposed infection. Patients treated with hydroxychloroquine showed a significant reduction in viral carriage by day 6 compared with control individuals.79 In the 6 patients who received both hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin, virus elimination was faster and more effective.79 This small study had multiple methodologic shortcomings, and further trials are testing this promising medication (NCT04261517).80 A randomized, controlled, open-label trial81 in 199 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 with low oxygen saturation indices tested a 14-day course of lopinavir-ritonavir vs standard care. The lopinavir-ritonavir treatment did not significantly accelerate clinical improvement, reduce 28-day mortality, or diminish throat viral RNA detectability vs standard care.81 However, in a modified intention-to-treat analysis, lopinavir-ritonavir accelerated clinical improvement by 1 day.81\nBoth SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 use the ACE2 receptor to enter the host cells, and ACE2 negatively regulates the renin-angiotensin system by inactivating angiotensin II and likely plays a protective role against the development and progression of acute lung failure.15,16 The clinical role of this pathway in COVID-19 complications and any effect from possible modulation of this receptor is not yet fully known and going to be tested in upcoming clinical trials (NCT04287686). At present, to our knowledge, there are no peer-reviewed experimental or clinical data demonstrating a specific benefit or risk from using ACE inhibitors, ARBs, or renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system antagonists in COVID-19.82 A joint statement by the Heart Failure Society of America, American College of Cardiology, and American Heart Association recommends that these medications can be continued in patients with COVID-19 without interruption in compliance with available clinical guidelines.82\nThe ACE2-dependent entry of SARS-CoV-2 into host cells can be blocked by camostat mesylate, an inhibitor of the cellular serine protease TMPRSS2, which is used by SARS-CoV-2 for S protein priming.83 Camostat mesylate is clinically available in Japan and is a promising agent to be tested further.83 Among anti-influenza medications, oseltamivir does not affect SARS-CoV-2, while preliminary studies have suggested some benefit from using favipiravir. A few health officials have suggested avoiding the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in patients with COVID-19, but peer-reviewed data in support of this claim are not yet available. Table 2 lists a number of medications that are either being tested or in planning stages for testing in patients with COVID-19.\nMeanwhile, vaccinations against influenza and pneumonia should be optimized to prevent febrile diseases that can masquerade or mask the diagnosis of COVID-19. This is particularly important because a high seasonal influenza activity is still observed in the United States. Vaccination against pneumococcal pneumonia should also be increased to reduce the risk of superimposed bacterial pneumonia.\nConclusions\nOur understanding of COVID-19, its diagnosis, prevention, and treatment is rapidly evolving. Physicians are urged to check the website of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and professional societies for the latest guidances.84 As the disease spreads and new evidence emerges, it would be prudent to identify the risk factors for the development of cardiac complications in patients with COVID-19. A prospective registry of patients with COVID-19 with a systematic recording of clinical variables and cardiovascular complications will be beneficial to identify the pattern of cardiovascular complications, to develop a risk model for cardiac complications, and to identify and/or predict response to various treatment modalities.\nBack to top\nArticle Information\nCorresponding Author: Mohammad Madjid, MD, MS, McGovern Medical School, Department of Medicine, University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston, 6431 Fannin, MSB 1.246, Houston, TX 77030 (mmadjid@gmail.com).\nPublished Online: March 27, 2020. doi:10.1001/jamacardio.2020.1286\nAccepted for Publication: March 21, 2020.\nConflict of Interest Disclosures: Dr Madjid has been a speaker and consultant to Sanofi Pasteur Inc.

Information about the clinical characteristics of infected patients who require intensive care is limited.\nObjective  To characterize patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) requiring treatment in an intensive care unit (ICU) in the Lombardy region of Italy.\nDesign, Setting, and Participants  Retrospective case series of 1591 consecutive patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 referred for ICU admission to the coordinator center (Fondazione IRCCS Ca\u2019 Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico, Milan, Italy) of the COVID-19 Lombardy ICU Network and treated at one of the ICUs of the 72 hospitals in this network between February 20 and March 18, 2020. Date of final follow-up was March 25, 2020.\nExposures  SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed by real-time reverse transcriptase\u2013polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay of nasal and pharyngeal swabs.\nMain Outcomes and Measures  Demographic and clinical data were collected, including data on clinical management, respiratory failure, and patient mortality. Data were recorded by the coordinator center on an electronic worksheet during telephone calls by the staff of the COVID-19 Lombardy ICU Network.\nResults  Of the 1591 patients included in the study, the median (IQR) age was 63 (56-70) years and 1304 (82%) were male. Of the 1043 patients with available data, 709 (68%) had at least 1 comorbidity and 509 (49%) had hypertension. Among 1300 patients with available respiratory support data, 1287 (99% [95% CI, 98%-99%]) needed respiratory support, including 1150 (88% [95% CI, 87%-90%]) who received mechanical ventilation and 137 (11% [95% CI, 9%-12%]) who received noninvasive ventilation. The median positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) was 14 (IQR, 12-16) cm H2O, and Fio2 was greater than 50% in 89% of patients. The median Pao2/Fio2 was 160 (IQR, 114-220). The median PEEP level was not different between younger patients (n\u2009=\u2009503 aged \u226463 years) and older patients (n\u2009=\u2009514 aged \u226564 years) (14 [IQR, 12-15] vs 14 [IQR, 12-16] cm H2O, respectively; median difference, 0 [95% CI, 0-0]; P\u2009=\u2009.94). Median Fio2 was lower in younger patients: 60% (IQR, 50%-80%) vs 70% (IQR, 50%-80%) (median difference, \u221210% [95% CI, \u221214% to 6%]; P\u2009=\u2009.006), and median Pao2/Fio2 was higher in younger patients: 163.5 (IQR, 120-230) vs 156 (IQR, 110-205) (median difference, 7 [95% CI, \u22128 to 22]; P\u2009=\u2009.02). Patients with hypertension (n\u2009=\u2009509) were older than those without hypertension (n\u2009=\u2009526) (median [IQR] age, 66 years [60-72] vs 62 years [54-68]; P\u2009<\u2009.001) and had lower Pao2/Fio2 (median [IQR], 146 [105-214] vs 173 [120-222]; median difference, \u221227 [95% CI, \u221242 to \u221212]; P\u2009=\u2009.005). Among the 1581 patients with ICU disposition data available as of March 25, 2020, 920 patients (58% [95% CI, 56%-61%]) were still in the ICU, 256 (16% [95% CI, 14%-18%]) were discharged from the ICU, and 405 (26% [95% CI, 23%-28%]) had died in the ICU. Older patients (n\u2009=\u2009786; age \u226564 years) had higher mortality than younger patients (n\u2009=\u2009795; age \u226463 years) (36% vs 15%; difference, 21% [95% CI, 17%-26%]; P\u2009<\u2009.001).\nConclusions and Relevance  In this case series of critically ill patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 admitted to ICUs in Lombardy, Italy, the majority were older men, a large proportion required mechanical ventilation and high levels of PEEP, and ICU mortality was 26%.\nIntroduction\nOn March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) outbreak a pandemic due to the constantly increasing number of cases outside China.1 Patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection can develop coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which has resulted in high rates of hospitalization and intensive care unit (ICU) admission.2\nOn February 20, 2020, the first patient diagnosed with COVID-19 in Italy developed respiratory failure and was admitted to one of the ICUs of Lombardy, a region of northern Italy. Since then, the increasing number of cases recorded in Lombardy, and subsequently throughout the country, led Italy to be the second most affected country in the world, after the US, as of March 27, 2020.3 Local health and government officials in Lombardy responded to the outbreak by creating a network of ICUs (COVID-19 Lombardy ICU Network) coordinated by Fondazione IRCCS Ca\u2019 Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico, Milan. This network has managed an exponential surge of patients requiring ICU admission for respiratory support.2\nUp through March 18, 2020, a total of 17\u202f713 people had tested positive for the new SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus in Lombardy and 1593 (9%) had been admitted to the ICU. Information on the incidence and clinical characteristics of critically ill patients diagnosed with COVID-19 is still limited. Among hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in China, the percentage of patients who required ICU care has varied from 5% to 32%.4,5\nThe availability of ICU beds and the provision of intensive care varies among countries.6 Knowledge of the baseline characteristics and outcomes of critically ill patients is crucial for health and government officials engaged in planning efforts to address local outbreaks. This case series describes the clinical characteristics of patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 admitted to ICUs of the COVID-19 Lombardy ICU Network in northern Italy.\nMethods\nThis retrospective observational study was performed at the Fondazione IRCCS Ca\u2019 Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico, Milan, which was the regional coordinating center for the COVID-19 Lombardy ICU Network. All consecutive patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, referred to Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico, and subsequently admitted to one of the ICUs among 72 hospitals in the network between February 20 and March 18, 2020, were enrolled. The institutional ethics board of Fondazione IRCCS Ca\u2019 Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico, Milan, approved this study and due to the nature of retrospective chart review, waived the need for informed consent from individual patients.\nAccording to the WHO guidance,7 laboratory confirmation for SARS-Cov-2 was defined as a positive result of real-time reverse transcriptase\u2013polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay of nasal and pharyngeal swabs. This guidance was implemented locally with the adjunct of using RT-PCR assay from lower respiratory tract aspirates as well.\nData were recorded by staff of the coordinator center on an electronic worksheet during daily telephone calls performed by intensivists of the hospitals of the COVID-19 Lombardy ICU Network.\nData Collection\nClinical data reported in this study were collected by phone within the first 6 to 24 hours following ICU admission. The recorded data included the following: age, sex, medical comorbidities, mode of respiratory support (invasive mechanical ventilation, noninvasive mechanical ventilation, oxygen mask), level of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP), fraction of inspired oxygen (Fio2), arterial partial pressure of oxygen (Pao2), Pao2/Fio2 ratio, the use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), and prone positioning. The number of patients who had died, had been discharged, and were still admitted in the ICU as of March 25, 2020, were recorded, and ICU length of stay also was determined.\nStatistical Analysis\nNo statistical sample size calculation was performed a priori, and sample size was equal to the number of patients treated during the study period. Continuous variables are presented as median and interquartile range (IQR) with 95% CIs. Categorical variables are expressed as number of patients (percentage) with 95% CIs. Differences in distributions of patient characteristics by median age subgroups and by presence/absence of hypertension are reported using differences with 95% CIs. Percentages of available data for the overall population are based on the total number of patients included in the study, distribution of available data over the age subgroups are based on the available data for that variable, and the other percentages are calculated using the number of available data for that subgroup.\nPatients were grouped by age and by median age. Age groups were defined as follows: 0 through 20 years; 21 through 40 years; 41 through 50 years; 51 through 60 years; 61 through 70 years; 71 through 80 years; 81 through 90 years; and 91 through 100 years. Younger and older age were classified as age lower than the median age and age equal or higher than the median age.\nMann-Whitney rank sum test was used to compare nonparametric continuous variables between median age subgroups and patients with or without hypertension. \u03c72 or Fisher exact test was used for categorical variables as appropriate. All statistical tests were 2-tailed, and statistical significance was defined as P\u2009<\u2009.05. Analyses were performed using SAS 9.4. The analyses have not been adjusted for multiple comparisons, and given the possibility of type I error, the findings should be interpreted as exploratory and descriptive.\nResults\nFrom February 20 to March 18, 2020, a total of 1694 patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 were referred to the coordinating center. A total of 77 patients had pending and 24 patients had negative test results for SARS-CoV-2; for 2 patients, data were not available. Thus, data from 1591 critically ill patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 were included in this report.\nTable 1 shows the demographic and clinical characteristics of the patients. Overall, 82% (1304 of 1591 patients [95% CI, 79.98%-83.82%]) were male, similarly distributed among all age groups. The median age was 63 years (IQR, 56-70) (range, 14-91 years [95% CI, 63-64]) among 1591 patients. A total of 363 patients (23% [95% CI, 21%-25%]) were aged 71 years and older, and 203 (13% [95% CI, 11%-15%]) were younger than 51 years. In this report, median age was used to stratify patients as younger (age \u226463 years) or older (age \u226564 years).\nSixty-eight percent (95% CI, 65%-71%) of patients had at least 1 comorbidity. Hypertension was the most common comorbidity, affecting 509 (49% [95% CI, 46%-52%]) of 1043 patients with available data. The second most common comorbidities were cardiovascular disease (223 patients, 21% [95% CI, 19%-24%]) and hypercholesterolemia (188 patients, 18% [95% CI, 16%-20%]). Only 42 patients (4% [95% CI, 3%-5%]) had a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. All the patients older than 80 years had at least 1 comorbidity, and 496 of 650 patients (76% [95% CI, 73%-80%]) older than 60 years had at least 1 comorbidity.\nAmong 1300 patients with available respiratory support data, 1287 (99% [95% CI, 98%-99%]) who were admitted to the ICU needed invasive or noninvasive respiratory support. A total of 1150 patients (88% [95% CI, 87%-90%]) required endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation, and 137 patients (11% [95% CI, 9%-12%]) were treated with noninvasive ventilation. Invasive mechanical ventilation was used in 565 (88% [95% CI, 85%-90%]) of the 645 younger patients with available data and in 585 (89% [95% CI, 87%-92%]) of the 655 older patients (difference, \u22122% [95% CI, \u22125% to 2%]; P\u2009=\u2009.33). Noninvasive ventilation was used in 70 (11% [95% CI, 9%-14%]) of the 645 younger patients with available data and in 67 (10% [95% CI, 8%-13%]) of the 655 older patients (difference, \u22121% [95% CI, \u22124% to 3%]; P\u2009=\u2009.71).\nThe median (IQR) positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) was 14 (12-16) cm H2O (n\u2009=\u20091017). PEEP levels as high as 22 cm H2O were applied. Among a total of 999 patients with available data, 887 (89% [95% CI, 87%-91%]) required a fraction of inspired oxygen (Fio2) of at least 50%, and 120 (12% [95% CI, 10%-14%]) required 100% Fio2. The median Pao2/Fio2 ratio was 160 (IQR, 114-220 [95% CI, 152-166]) (n\u2009=\u2009781). PEEP level grouped by median age was not significantly different (median, 14 [IQR, 12-15] cm H2O in the group aged \u226463 years vs 14 cm H2O [IQR, 12-16] in the group aged \u226564 years; median difference, 0 [95% CI, 0-0]; P\u2009=\u2009.94). Fio2 was higher in older patients (median, 60% [IQR, 50%-80%] in the group aged \u226463 years vs 70% [IQR, 50%-80%] in the group aged \u226564 years; median difference, \u221210% [95% CI, \u221214% to \u22126%]; P\u2009=\u2009.006). Pao2/Fio2 was higher in the younger patients (163.5 [IQR, 120-230] in the group aged \u226463 years vs 156 [IQR, 110-205] in the group aged \u226564 years; median difference, 7 [95% CI, \u22128 to 22]; P\u2009=\u2009.02).\nThe Figure shows distribution of age, PEEP, Fio2, and Pao2/Fio2. At admission, 240 of 875 patients (27% [95% CI, 25%-31%]) were treated with prone ventilation and 5 of 498 (1% [95% CI, 0.3%-2%]) required extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO).\nCompared with patients without hypertension (n\u2009=\u2009526), patients with hypertension (n\u2009=\u2009509) were significantly older (median age, 66 [IQR, 60-72] years vs 62 [IQR, 54-68] years; median difference, 4 [95% CI, 2-6]; P\u2009<\u2009.001) and had higher PEEP levels (median [IQR], 14 [12-16] vs 14 [12-15] cm H2O; median difference, 0 [95% CI, 0-0]; P\u2009=\u2009.003) and lower Pao2/Fio2 (median, 146 [IQR, 105-214] vs 173 [IQR, 120-222]; median difference, \u221227 [95% CI, \u221242 to \u221212; P\u2009=\u2009.005). However, there was no statistically significant difference in Fio2 (median, 70 [IQR, 50-80] in the group with hypertension vs 60 [IQR, 50-80] in the group without hypertension; median difference, 10 [95% CI, 6-14]; P\u2009=\u2009.05).\nAmong the 1581 patients with ICU disposition data available as of March 25, 2020, 920 patients (58% [95% CI, 56%-61%]) were still in the ICU, 256 (16% [95% CI, 14%-18%]) had been discharged from the ICU, and 405 (26% [95% CI, 23%-28%]) had died in the ICU. ICU mortality was higher in those who were older (Table 2). ICU mortality was significantly lower in younger patients (\u226463 years) compared with older patients (\u226564 years) (15% vs 36%; difference, \u221221% [95% CI, \u221226% to \u221217%]; P\u2009<\u2009.001). The percentage of patients discharged from the ICU was significantly higher among younger patients compared with older patients (21% vs 11%; difference, 9% [95% CI, 6%-13%]; P\u2009<\u2009.001).\nAs of March 25, 2020, the median (IQR) length of stay in the ICU was 9 (6-13 [95% CI, 9-9]) days (n\u2009=\u20091591). Among patients still in the ICU (n\u2009=\u2009920), the median (IQR) length of stay was 10 days (8-14 [95% CI, 10-11]); among patients discharged from the ICU (n\u2009=\u2009256), the median length of stay was 8 days (5-12 [95% CI, 8-9]); and among patients who died in the ICU (n\u2009=\u2009405), the median length of stay was 7 (5-11 [95% CI, 7-8]) days.\nThe prevalence of hypertension was higher among patients who died in the ICU (63%, 195 of 309 patients) compared with those discharged from the ICU (40%, 84 of 212 patients) (difference, 23% [95% CI, 15%-32%]; P\u2009<\u2009.001) (Table 2).\nDiscussion\nIn this case series of critically ill patients admitted to ICUs in Lombardy, Italy, with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 from February 20 to March 18, 2020, the majority were older men, a large proportion required mechanical ventilation and high levels of PEEP, and ICU mortality was 26%.\nThe majority of patients in this case series were admitted to the ICU because of acute hypoxemic respiratory failure that required respiratory support. Endotracheal intubation and invasive mechanical ventilation were needed in 88% of the patients, whereas only 11% could be managed with noninvasive ventilation. The need for invasive mechanical ventilation in this patient population was higher than that recently reported for other ICU patients: 71% (Washington State, US),8 47% (Wuhan, China),9 42% (Wuhan, China)10 and 30% (Wuhan, China; of note, half of these were treated with ECMO).5 The need for invasive mechanical ventilation in this critically ill Italian patient population was also higher compared with data reported by 2 Chinese studies from Wuhan, including all adult inpatients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 and patients hospitalized with severe disease (with rates of 17%11 and 15%,4 respectively).\nConversely, in previously cited reports, noninvasive ventilation has been used much more frequently both inside and outside the ICU. For the ICU population, the use of noninvasive ventilation was reported as 19% (Washington State, US),8 42% (Wuhan, China),9 56% (Wuhan, China),10 and 62% (Wuhan, China; of note, this value included patients receiving high-flow nasal cannula).5 In previous reports, noninvasive ventilation was used in 14% of adult inpatients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-1911 and 32% of hospitalized patients with severe laboratory-confirmed COVID-19.4\nThe higher rate of intubation in the current case series could be due to the severity of hypoxia (the median Pao2/Fio2 was 160), thus requiring high levels of PEEP. However, in one of the recent reports, the Pao2/Fio2 ratio upon ICU admission was even lower (136).9 Another potential explanation is that the majority of the patients requiring noninvasive ventilation in northern Italy were able to be managed outside the ICU and were thus not included in this report. Data regarding use of respiratory support were missing for some patients (n\u2009=\u2009291, or 18.3%), which may also have influenced the rates of respiratory support reported in this study.\nThe population in this study consisted mostly of men (82%, which is higher than previously reported) and older individuals.4,9,10 The median age of the patients admitted to the ICU was 63 (IQR, 56-70) years old, which is the same as the median age of all the positive Italian cases with COVID-1912 suggesting that, to date, older age alone is not a risk factor for admission to the ICU.\nIn this cohort of patients, 68% had at least 1 comorbidity, in line with that reported by Wang et al (72.2%),9 but much higher than in other reports.4,5 Similar to other previous reports,4,9 hypertension was the most common comorbidity, followed by cardiovascular disorders, hypercholesterolemia, and diabetes. Among older patients, comorbidities were common but a relatively small percentage of patients had pulmonary disease.\nPrevious reports described different mortality rates among patients requiring ICU admission, from 16%9 to 38%,5 62%,10 67%,8 and 78%.11 In this study, at 5 weeks after the first admission in ICU, the majority of the patients (58%) were still in the ICU, 16% of the patients had been discharged from the ICU, and 26% had died in the ICU. The death rate was higher among those who were older. However, these outcome data should be interpreted with caution because most patients were still hospitalized in the ICU and the minimum follow-up was 7 days; in particular, the mortality rate could eventually be higher.\nTo the best of our knowledge, this is the largest case series of patients with COVID-19 and severe illness who required admission to the ICU. Available data indicate considerable variability among different countries in both the proportion of severe cases of COVID-19 among those testing positive and in the proportion of severe cases of COVID-19 among those hospitalized with the disease. Among western countries, Italy seems to have a higher rate of severely ill patients and thus it is particularly relevant to report the demographic and clinical characteristics of this population upon admission to the ICU. The majority of the patients had moderate to severe respiratory failure and required invasive mechanical ventilation and high levels of PEEP.\nThese data could reflect a different organization of health care systems in the world. In Italy, for instance, noninvasive ventilation is delivered both in ICUs and in other hospital wards. The amount of intensive care support that has been provided by intensivists outside of previously existing ICUs and newly created ICUs was not quantified. While the final figures are not yet available, the number of level 2 ICU beds (providing high-flow oxygen, continuous positive airway pressure, or noninvasive ventilation) is estimated to be high with a large number of beds created to increase capacity to deal with severely ill patients during the COVID-19 outbreak. These data will be collected soon to provide a complete description of the critically ill patients with COVID-19.\nThese data also suggest that the need for organ support and intensive care, regardless of the reason, in the COVID-19 outbreak is substantial, with 9% of all positive cases being probably a conservative estimate. The volume of critically ill patients with COVID-19 infection that ICUs might be required to manage may be substantial, and adequate ICU capacity to deal with severe respiratory failure should be planned.\nLimitations\nThis study has several limitations. First, this was a retrospective study, and data were acquired via telephone. Second, the critical nature of the Lombardy situation did not allow the coordinator to obtain more detailed information, such as baseline medication use. Third, the follow-up time is still relatively short compared with the course of the disease, and the reported mortality data and length of stay data reported in this study could change. Fourth, there were relatively large amounts of missing data for some outcomes.\nConclusions\nIn this case series of critically ill patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 admitted to ICUs in Lombardy, Italy, the majority were older men, a large proportion required mechanical ventilation and high levels of PEEP, and ICU mortality was 26%.\nBack to top\nArticle Information\nCorresponding Author: Maurizio Cecconi, MD, Department of Anaesthesia and Intensive Care Medicine, Humanitas Clinical and Research Centre-IRCCS, Via Manzoni 56, 20089, Rozzano, Milan, Italy (maurizio.cecconi@hunimed.eu).\nAccepted for Publication: March 28, 2020.\nPublished Online: April 6, 2020. doi:10.1001/jama.2020.5394\nAuthor Contributions: Dr Zanella had full access to all of the data in the study and takes responsibility for the integrity of the data and the accuracy of the data analysis.

Several studies have described typical clinical manifestations including fever, cough, diarrhea, and fatigue. However, to our knowledge, it has not been reported that patients with COVID-19 had any neurologic manifestations.\nObjective  To study the neurologic manifestations of patients with COVID-19.\nDesign, Setting, and Participants  This is a retrospective, observational case series. Data were collected from January 16, 2020, to February 19, 2020, at 3 designated special care centers for COVID-19 (Main District, West Branch, and Tumor Center) of the Union Hospital of Huazhong University of Science and Technology in Wuhan, China. The study included 214 consecutive hospitalized patients with laboratory-confirmed diagnosis of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection.\nMain Outcomes and Measures  Clinical data were extracted from electronic medical records, and data of all neurologic symptoms were checked by 2 trained neurologists. Neurologic manifestations fell into 3 categories: central nervous system manifestations (dizziness, headache, impaired consciousness, acute cerebrovascular disease, ataxia, and seizure), peripheral nervous system manifestations (taste impairment, smell impairment, vision impairment, and nerve pain), and skeletal muscular injury manifestations.\nResults  Of 214 patients (mean [SD] age, 52.7 [15.5] years; 87 men [40.7%]) with COVID-19, 126 patients (58.9%) had nonsevere infection and 88 patients (41.1%) had severe infection according to their respiratory status. Overall, 78 patients (36.4%) had neurologic manifestations. Compared with patients with nonsevere infection, patients with severe infection were older, had more underlying disorders, especially hypertension, and showed fewer typical symptoms of COVID-19, such as fever and cough. Patients with more severe infection had neurologic manifestations, such as acute cerebrovascular diseases (5 [5.7%] vs 1 [0.8%]), impaired consciousness (13 [14.8%] vs 3 [2.4%]), and skeletal muscle injury (17 [19.3%] vs 6 [4.8%]).\nConclusions and Relevance  Patients with COVID-19 commonly have neurologic manifestations. During the epidemic period of COVID-19, when seeing patients with neurologic manifestations, clinicians should suspect severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection as a differential diagnosis to avoid delayed diagnosis or misdiagnosis and lose the chance to treat and prevent further transmission.\nIntroduction\nIn December 2019, many unexplained pneumonia cases occurred in Wuhan, China, and rapidly spread to other parts of China, then to Europe, North America, and Asia. This outbreak was confirmed to be caused by a novel coronavirus (CoV).1 The novel CoV was reported to have symptoms resembling that of severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV (SARS-CoV) in 2003.2 Both shared the same receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2).3 Therefore, this virus was named SARS-CoV-2, and in February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) named the disease coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). As of March 5, 2020, there were 95\u202f333 confirmed cases of COVID-19 and 3282 deaths globally.4\nCoronaviruses can cause multiple systemic infections or injuries in various animals.5 The CoVs can adapt quickly and cross the species barrier, such as with SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome CoV (MERS-CoV), causing epidemics or pandemics. Infection in humans often leads to severe clinical symptoms and high mortality.6 As for COVID-19, several studies have described typical clinical manifestations including fever, cough, diarrhea, and fatigue. Coronavirus disease 2019 also has characteristic laboratory findings and lung computed tomography (CT) abnormalities.7 However, to our knowledge, it has not been reported that patients with COVID-19 had any neurologic manifestations. Here, we report the characteristic neurologic manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 infection in 78 of 214 patients with laboratory-confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 and treated at our hospitals, which are located in the epicenter of Wuhan.\nMethods\nStudy Design and Participants\nThis retrospective, observational study was done at 3 centers (Main District, West Branch, and Tumor Center) of Union Hospital of Huazhong University of Science and Technology (Wuhan, China). These 3 centers are designated hospitals assigned by the government to treat patients with COVID-19. We retrospectively analyzed consecutive patients from January 16, 2020, to February 19, 2020, who had been diagnosed as having COVID-19, according to WHO interim guidance.8 A confirmed case of COVID-19 was defined as a positive result on high-throughput sequencing or real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction analysis of throat swab specimens. Throat swab samples were collected and placed into a collection tube containing preservation solution for the virus.9 A SARS-CoV-2 infection was confirmed by real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction assay using a SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid detection kit according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol (Shanghai bio-germ Medical Technology Co). Radiologic assessments included chest and head CT, and all laboratory testing (a complete blood cell count, blood chemical analysis, coagulation testing, assessment of liver and renal function testing, C-reactive protein, creatine kinase, and lactate dehydrogenase) was performed according to the clinical care needs of the patient. Two hundred fourteen hospitalized patients with laboratory confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 were included in the analysis.9 Before enrollment, verbal consent was obtained from patients or an accompanying relative for patients who could not give consent. The study was performed in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. This study was approved and written informed consent was waived by the Ethics Committee of Union hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China, on February 20, 2020, owing to the rapid emergence of the disease and the urgent need to collect data.\nData Collection\nWe reviewed electronic medical records, nursing records, laboratory findings, and radiologic examinations for all patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and collected data on age, sex, comorbidities (hypertension, diabetes, cardiac or cerebrovascular disease, malignancy, and chronic kidney disease), typical symptoms from onset to hospital admission (fever, cough, anorexia, diarrhea, throat pain, abdominal pain), nervous system symptoms, laboratory findings, and CT scan (chest and head if available). Subjective symptoms were provided by patients who were conscious, cognitively and mentally normal, and linguistically competent to respond to interview. Any missing or uncertain records were collected and clarified through direct communication with involved patients, health care clinicians, and their families. We defined the degree of severity of COVID-19 (severe vs nonsevere) at the time of admission using the American Thoracic Society guidelines for community-acquired pneumonia.10\nAll neurologic manifestations were reviewed and confirmed by 2 trained neurologists. Major disagreement between 2 reviewers was resolved by consultation with a third reviewer. Neurologic manifestations were categorized into 3 categories: central nervous system (CNS) manifestations (dizziness, headache, impaired consciousness, acute cerebrovascular disease, ataxia, and seizure), peripheral nervous system (PNS) manifestations (taste impairment, smell impairment, vision impairment, and nerve pain), and skeletal muscular injury manifestations. Impaired consciousness includes the change of consciousness level (somnolence, stupor, and coma) and consciousness content (confusion and delirium). To avoid cross-infection during the outbreak, we had to minimize patients going out for examination. Therefore, the diagnosis of nervous system manifestations mainly depended on the subjective symptoms of patients and the examinations available. Acute cerebrovascular disease includes ischemic stroke and cerebral hemorrhage diagnosed by clinical symptoms and head CT. Seizure is based on the clinical symptoms at the time of presentation. Skeletal muscle injury was defined as when a patient had skeletal muscle pain and elevated serum creatine kinase level greater than 200 U/L (to convert to microkatals per liter, multiply by 0.0167).7\nStatistical Analysis\nFor baseline data, mean and standard deviations (SD) were used for normally distributed data and median and range for data that were not normally distributed. Categorical variables were expressed as counts and percentages. Continuous variables were compared by using the Wilcoxon rank sum test. Proportions for categorical variables were compared using the \u03c72 test. All statistical analyses were performed using R, version 3.3.0, software (the R Foundation). The significance threshold was set at a 2-sided P value less than .05.\nResults\nDemographic and Clinical Characteristics\nA total of 214 hospitalized patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were included in the analysis. Their demographic and clinical characteristics were shown in Table 1. Their mean (SD) age was 52.7 (15.5) years, and 87 were men (40.7%). Of these patients, 83 (38.8%) had at least 1 of the following underlying disorders: hypertension (51 [23.8%]), diabetes (30 [14.0%]), cardiac or cerebrovascular disease (15 [7.0%]), and malignancy (13 [6.1%]). The most common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (132 [61.7%]), cough (107 [50.0%]), and anorexia (68 [31.8%]). Seventy-eight patients (36.4%) had nervous system manifestations: CNS (53 [24.8%]), PNS (19 [8.9%]), and skeletal muscle injury (23 [10.7%]). In patients with CNS manifestations, the most common reported symptoms were dizziness (36 [16.8%]) and headache (28 [13.1%]). In patients with PNS symptoms, the most common reported symptoms were taste impairment (12 [5.6%]) and smell impairment (11 [5.1%]).\nAccording to the American Thoracic Society guidelines for community-acquired pneumonia,10 88 patients (41.1%) had severe infection and 126 patients (58.9%) had nonsevere infection. The patients with severe infection were significantly older (mean [SD] age, 58.2 [15.0] years vs 48.9 [14.7] years; P\u2009<\u2009.001) and more likely to have other underlying disorders (42 [47.7%] vs 41 [32.5%]; P\u2009=\u2009.03), especially hypertension (32 [36.4%] vs 19 [15.1%]; P\u2009<\u2009.001), and had fewer typical symptoms of COVID-19 such as fever (40 [45.5%] vs 92 [73%]; P\u2009<\u2009.001) and dry cough (30 [34.1%] vs 77 [61.1%]; P\u2009<\u2009.001). Moreover, nervous system manifestations were significantly more common in severe infections compared with nonsevere infections (40 [45.5%] vs 38 [30.2%], P\u2009=n\u2009.02). They included acute cerebrovascular disease (5 [5.7%]; 4 patients with ischemic stroke and 1 with cerebral hemorrhage who died later of respiratory failure; vs 1 [0.8%]; 1 patient with ischemic stroke; P\u2009=\u2009.03, Figure), impaired consciousness (13 [14.8%] vs 3 [2.4%]; P\u2009<\u2009.001), and skeletal muscle injury (17 [19.3%] vs 6 [4.8%]; P\u2009<\u2009.001). In the severe group, 1 patient had a seizure characterized by a sudden onset of limb twitching, foaming in the mouth, and loss of consciousness, which lasted for 3 minutes.\nApart from cerebrovascular disease and impaired consciousness, most neurologic manifestations occurred early in the illness (median time, 1-2 days). Of 6 patients with acute cerebrovascular disease, 2 arrived at the emergency department owing to sudden onset of hemiplegia but without any typical symptoms (fever, cough, anorexia, and diarrhea) of COVID-19. Their lung lesions were found by an emergent lung CT and were diagnosed as having COVID-19 by a positive SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid detection in the later stage. Some patients with fever and headache were admitted to the neurology ward after initially being ruled out of COVID-19 by routine blood test results and a screening lung CT in the clinic. However, several days later, they had typical COVID-19 symptoms such as cough, throat pain, lower lymphocyte count, and ground-glass opacity appearance on lung CT. Their diagnosis of COVID-19 was confirmed by a positive nucleic acid test and then they were transferred to the isolation ward.\nLaboratory Findings in Patients and With Severe and Nonsevere Infection\nTable 2 showed the laboratory findings in severe and nonsevere subgroups. Patients with severe infection had more increased inflammatory response, including higher white blood cell counts, neutrophil counts, lower lymphocyte counts, and increased C-reactive protein levels compared with those patients with nonsevere infection (white blood cell count: median, 5.4 \u00d7 109/L [range, 0.1-20.4] vs 4.5 \u00d7 109/L [range, 1.8-14.0]; P\u2009<\u2009.001; neutrophil: median, 3.8 \u00d7 109/L [range, 0.0-18.7] vs 2.6 \u00d7 109/L [range, 0.7-11.8]; P\u2009<\u2009.001; lymphocyte count: median, 0.9 \u00d7 109/L [range, 0.1-2.6] vs 1.3 \u00d7 109/L [range, 0.4-2.6]; P\u2009<\u2009.001; C-reactive protein: median, 37.1 mg/L [range, 0.1-212.0] vs 9.4 mg/L [range, 0.2-126.0]; P\u2009<\u2009.001). The patients with severe infection had higher D-dimer levels than patients with nonsevere infection (median, 0.9 mg/L [range, 0.1-20.0] vs 0.4 mg/L [range, 0.2-8.7]; P\u2009<\u2009.001), which was indicative of consumptive coagulation system. In addition, patients with severe infection had multiple organ involvement, such as serious liver (increased lactate dehydrogenase, alanine aminotransferase, and aspartate aminotransferase levels), kidney (increased blood urea nitrogen and creatinine levels), and skeletal muscle damage (increased creatinine kinase levels).\nLaboratory Findings in Patients With and Without CNS Symptoms\nTable 3 showed the laboratory findings of patients with and without CNS symptoms. We found that patients with CNS symptoms had lower lymphocyte levels, platelet counts, and higher blood urea nitrogen levels compared with those without CNS symptoms (lymphocyte count: median, 1.0 \u00d7 109/L [range, 0.1-2.3] vs 1.2 \u00d7 109/L [range, 0.2-2.6], P\u2009=\u2009.049; platelet count: median, 180.0 \u00d7 109/L [range, 18.0-564.0] vs 227.0 \u00d7 109/L [range, 42.0-583.0], P\u2009=\u2009.005; blood urea nitrogen: median, 4.5 mmol/L [range, 1.6-48.1] vs 4.1 mmol/L [range, 1.5-19.1], P\u2009=\u2009.04). For the severe subgroup, patients with CNS symptoms also had lower lymphocyte levels and platelet counts and higher blood urea nitrogen levels compared with those without CNS symptoms (lymphocyte count: median, 0.7 \u00d7 109/L [range, 0.1-1.6] vs 0.9 \u00d7 109/L [range, 0.2-2.6], P\u2009=\u2009.007; platelet count: median, 169.0 \u00d7 109/L [range, 18.0-564.0] vs 220.0 \u00d7 109/L [range, 109.0-576.0], P\u2009=\u2009.04; blood urea nitrogen: median, 5.0 mmol/L [range, 2.3-48.1] vs 4.4 mmol/L [range, 1.5-19.1], P\u2009=\u2009.04). For the nonsevere subgroup, there were no significant differences in laboratory findings of patients with and without CNS symptoms.\nLaboratory Findings in Patients With and Without PNS Symptoms\nTable 4 showed the laboratory findings of patients with and without PNS symptoms. We found that there were no significant differences in laboratory findings of patients with PNS and those without PNS. Similar results were also found in the severe subgroup and nonsevere subgroup, respectively.\nLaboratory Findings in Patients With and Without Skeletal Muscle Injury\nThe eTable in the Supplement shows the laboratory findings of patients with and without skeletal muscle injury. Compared with the patients without muscle injury, patients with muscle injury had significantly higher levels of creatine kinase (median, 400.0 U/L [range 203.0-12216.0] vs median, 58.5 U/L [range 8.8-212.0]; P\u2009<\u2009.001), regardless of their severity. Meanwhile, patients with muscle injury had higher neutrophil counts, lower lymphocyte counts, higher C-reactive protein levels, and higher D-dimer levels. The abnormalities were manifestations of increased inflammatory response and blood coagulation function. In addition, we found that patients with muscle injury had multiorgan damage, including more serious liver (increased lactate dehydrogenase, alanine aminotransferase, and aspartate aminotransferase levels) and kidney (increased blood urea nitrogen and creatinine levels) abnormalities.\nFor the severe group, patients with skeletal muscle injury had decreased lymphocyte counts and more serious liver injury (increased lactate dehydrogenase, alanine aminotransferase, and aspartate aminotransferase levels) and kidney injury (increased creatinine levels).\nDiscussion\nTo our knowledge, this is the first report on detailed neurologic manifestations of the hospitalized patients with COVID-19. As of February 19, 2020, of 214 patients included in this study, 88 (41.1%) had severe infection and 126 (58.9%) had nonsevere infection. Of these, 78 (36.4%) had various neurologic manifestations that involved CNS, PNS, and skeletal muscles. Compared with patients with nonsevere infection, patients with severe infection were older and had more hypertension but fewer typical symptoms such as fever and cough. Patients with severe infection were more likely to develop neurologic manifestations, especially acute cerebrovascular disease, conscious disturbance, and skeletal muscle injury. Most neurologic manifestations occurred early in the illness (the median time to hospital admission was 1-2 days). Some patients without typical symptoms (fever, cough, anorexia, and diarrhea) of COVID-19 came to the hospital with only neurologic manifestation as their presenting symptoms. Therefore, for patients with COVID-19, we need to pay close attention to their neurologic manifestations, especially for those with severe infections, which may have contributed to their death. Moreover, during the epidemic period of COVID-19, when seeing patients with these neurologic manifestations, physicians should consider SARS-CoV-2 infection as a differential diagnosis to avoid delayed diagnosis or misdiagnosis and prevention of transmission.\nIn January 2020,3 ACE2 was identified as the functional receptor for SARS-CoV-2, which is present in multiple human organs, including nervous system and skeletal muscles.11 The expression and distribution of ACE2 remind us that the SARS-CoV-2 may cause some neurologic manifestations through direct or indirect mechanisms. Autopsy results of patients with COVID-19 showed that the brain tissue was hyperemic and edematous and some neurons degenerated.12 Neurologic injury has been confirmed in the infection of other CoVs such as in SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. The researchers detected SARS-CoV nucleic acid in the cerebrospinal fluid of those patients and also in their brain tissue on autopsy.13,14\nCentral nervous system symptoms were the main form of neurologic injury in patients with COVID-19 in this study. The pathologic mechanism may be from the CNS invasion of SARS-CoV-2, similar to SARS and MERS viruses. As with other respiratory viruses, SARS-COV-2 may enter the CNS through the hematogenous or retrograde neuronal route. The latter can be supported by the fact that some patients in this study had smell impairment. We also found that the lymphocyte counts were lower for patients with CNS symptoms than without CNS symptoms. This phenomenon may be indicative of the immunosuppression in patients with COVID-19 with CNS symptoms, especially in the severe subgroup. Moreover, we found patients with severe infection had higher D-dimer levels than that of patients with nonsevere infection. This may be the reason why patients with severe infection are more likely to develop cerebrovascular disease.\nConsistent with the previous studies,7 muscle symptoms were also common in our study. We speculate that the symptom was owing to skeletal muscle injury, as confirmed by elevated creatine kinase levels. We found that patients with muscle symptoms had higher creatine kinase and lactate dehydrogenase levels than those without muscle symptoms. Furthermore, creatine kinase and lactate dehydrogenase levels in patients with severe infection were much higher than those of patients with nonsevere infection. This injury could be associated with ACE2 in skeletal muscle.15 However, SARS-CoV, using the same receptor, was not detected in skeletal muscle by postmortem examination.16 Therefore, whether SARS-CoV-2 infects skeletal muscle cells by binding with ACE2 needs to be further studied. One other reason was the infection-mediated harmful immune response that caused the nervous system abnormalities. Significantly elevated proinflammatory cytokines in serum may cause skeletal muscle damage.\nLimitations\nThis study has several limitations. First, only 214 patients were studied, which could cause biases in clinical observation. It would be better to include more patients from Wuhan, other cities in China, and even other countries. Second, all data were abstracted from the electronic medical records; certain patients with neurologic symptoms might not be captured if their neurologic manifestations were too mild, such as with taste impairment and smell impairment. Third, because most patients were still hospitalized and information regarding clinical outcomes was unavailable at the time of analysis, it was difficult to assess the effect of these neurologic manifestations on their outcome, and continued observations of the natural history of disease are needed. Fourth, during the outbreak period of COVID-19, because of the influx of many patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, advanced neuroimaging, such as magnetic resonance imaging and diagnostic procedures such as lumbar puncture and electromyography/nerve conduction velocity, was purposefully avoided to reduce the risk of cross infection. Therefore, in our study, most of the symptoms were a patient\u2019s subjective descriptions. We could not distinguish whether these neurologic manifestations are caused by the virus directly or by the pulmonary disease or other organ damage indirectly.\nConclusions\nIn conclusion, SARS-CoV-2 may infect nervous system and skeletal muscle as well as the respiratory tract. In those with severe infection, neurologic involvement is greater, which includes acute cerebrovascular diseases, impaired consciousness, and skeletal muscle injury. Their clinical conditions may worsen, and patients may die sooner. This study may offer important new clinical information on COVID-19 that would help clinicians raise awareness of its involvement of neurologic manifestations. It is especially meaningful to learn that for those with severe COVID-19, rapid clinical deterioration or worsening could be associated with a neurologic event such as stroke, which would contribute to its high mortality rate. Moreover, during the epidemic period of COVID-19, when seeing patients with these neurologic manifestations, clinicians should consider SARS-CoV-2 infection as a differential diagnosis to avoid delayed diagnosis or misdiagnosis and prevention of transmission.\nBack to top\nArticle Information\nCorresponding Authors: Bo Hu, MD, PhD (hubo@mail.hust.edu.cn) and Yanan Li, MD, PhD (liyn@mail.hust.edu.cn), Department of Neurology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, 430022, China.\nAccepted for Publication: March 26, 2020.\nPublished Online: April 10, 2020. doi:10.1001/jamaneurol.2020.1127\nAuthor Contributions: Dr B.

In the next 24 hours there were 36 more cases, none of whom had contact with the first patient or with anyone known to have COVID-19. This was the beginning of one of the largest and most serious clusters of COVID-19 in the world. Despite aggressive containment efforts, the disease continues to spread and the number of affected patients is rising. The case-fatality rate has been very high and is dominated by very old patients. This Infographic shows the most recent statistics emerging from Italy regarding the country\u2019s experience with COVID-19.\nBack to top\nArticle Information\nSources: Adapted from the COVID-19 Task Force of the Department of Infectious Diseases and the IT Service Instituto Superiore di Sanit\u00e0.\nhttps://www.iss.it/infografiche", "jamapediatrics.2020.1459": "A\npril is Child Abuse Awareness month, even during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.\nSocial isolation, the public health measure now in place across the world, is also a proven risk factor for child abuse. Other risks include stress, uncertain access to food and housing, and worries about making ends meet. Owing to the current COVID-19 pandemic, we recognize that parents and caregivers feel overwhelmed with these stresses. They may be experiencing job loss, childcare struggles, and schedule changes.\nWith schools and daycare centers closed for weeks or more, children are no longer in the watchful eyes of their community. Teachers, counselors, extended family, and friends who routinely see children are now physically separated and unable to provide the same social and emotional support. Many school or community programs that prevent child abuse are currently on hold. The vital social distancing that attempts to flatten the curve for COVID-19 hinders these prevention efforts.\nResearch shows that all types of child abuse increase during school holidays and summer breaks and worsen during natural disasters such as hurricanes. We expect that throughout the course of the COVID-19 pandemic, when emotions are running high and children are more socially isolated than ever, child abuse will surge. Much of this abuse will be unreported.\nWhile we face these challenges, parents and friends can help reduce the risk of child abuse in several ways. First, call, video chat, or email friends and family. This virtual contact and support can be a good boost for parents and gives children the opportunity to connect with someone outside of their home. Second, establish and stick to a family schedule. This provides structure and routine. Set meal times, bedtimes, schoolwork, and even play time can help with daily tasks. Starting or restarting rest time can help children and caregivers recharge. Third, find out about community resources. Many towns and cities have food banks and free meals for children and families. Some communities are creating fun ways for children to engage socially without physical contact. Chalk messages on sidewalks and teddy bear sightings in windows provide a way to connect. While small, these gestures reduce feelings of isolation. Fourth, financial stress is real. Mortgage lenders, student loan holders, and banks are taking steps to reduce, stop, or postpone penalties. Look into opportunities that may provide financial relief. Last, remember you are not alone. If you need help, you can call the National Parent Helpline at 1-855-427-2736 or the Childhelp National Child Abuse Hotline at 1-800-4-A-CHILD.\nIn many states, all citizens serve as mandatory reporters. If someone suspects child abuse or neglect, they are required by law to report these concerns to the police or state welfare agencies. By working together to look out for children, we may be able to help prevent cases of child abuse and neglect.\nFor More Information\nChild abuse and neglect resources: https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/childabuseandneglect/resources.html\nCoronavirus resources and tips for parents, children, and others: https://preventchildabuse.org/coronavirus-resources/\nNational Parenting Education Network: https://npen.org/\nThe JAMA Pediatrics Patient Page is a public service of JAMA Pediatrics.

We detail a plan for aggressive community screening with the goal of controlling, if not eradicating, local severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) transmission. For at least 2 months, access to reagents, swabs, and tests have been a bottleneck. We believe this bottleneck is abating, as evidenced by recent dramatic increases in testing. The limiting factor, then, is a matter of operations and logistics. In the absence of an effective vaccine, separating persons who are unknowingly infected from individuals with susceptibility is the best way to block transmission. Ongoing community transmission demands an aggressive approach to achieve this goal.\nOur proposed screening approach is designed to maximize the number of persons with infections who are detected. Three complementary testing strategies together can achieve this goal. The first is to remove physician referral and cost restrictions on the testing of individuals with symptoms, so anyone with symptoms suggestive of COVID-19 can be screened. Many such persons will have negative test results, but among individuals with symptoms of COVID-19 whose cases have not yet been detected by other means, this option offers the quickest way to isolate them and thereby prevent further transmission to individuals who are susceptible. Existing and additional drive-through testing sites are useful for this purpose but need to be augmented in other ways in poorer communities, where reliance on public transportation in urban areas or a lack of large health centers in rural areas makes testing less accessible.\nThe second and most intensive approach is to deploy targeted testing in locations where persons more likely to be infected can be found. Such sentinel sites will be initially selected on the basis of population density within dwellings (eg, nursing homes, public or congregate housing, apartment buildings) and by community (population per square mile), as informed by local information on COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations, and deaths. Testing sites would also include locations where residents may congregate, such as grocery stores or pharmacies. Testing teams would be agile and able to move on a daily basis between locations identified for targeted testing.\nThe third approach is to reserve a small number of tests for random population screening. This approach provides the benchmark for assessing whether sentinel sites are efficiently detecting persons with infections. Sites where the yield is not substantially higher than the estimated population prevalence would be abandoned in favor of other high-risk sentinel sites. Updating screening sites in this way will always direct the program toward areas with greater numbers of persons with infections, thereby maximizing testing efficiency.\nOthers have proposed massive random screening of the US population with up to 30 million tests per day. Our view is that targeted screening can quickly find sentinel sites where the current prevalence of infection is substantially greater than the mean. For example, a recent investigation2 found that 15% of pregnant women presenting for delivery at a New York hospital tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, and 29 of the 33 with positive test results were initially asymptomatic. Finding other such hot spots could allow for dramatically increased testing efficiency; testing 10% of the population at random each day could be reduced to testing 1% to 2% in a targeted manner.\nOur approach still requires collecting millions of samples and corresponding contact information. Those found to have infections would be notified within a day and advised to isolate at home. Recognizing that home isolation is not always feasible, public accommodation of isolation quarters would be offered to those not sufficiently ill to require hospitalization or subacute care but who cannot isolate at home. The outcome of our plan would be substantially diminished if isolation does not follow identification.\nSome might worry that imperfect test performance would misdirect our targeting efforts, but such fears are unfounded. For community screening, we focus on polymerase chain reaction testing, because the goal is to find persons with current infections as opposed to signals of past infection indicated by antibody tests. Letting \u03b1 and \u03b2 denote the sensitivity and specificity of whatever diagnostic test is used, the observed prevalence pObs is associated with the true prevalence p, in that pObs\u2009=\u2009p\u2009\u00d7\u2009\u03b1\u2009+\u2009(1\u2009\u2212\u2009p)\u2009\u00d7\u2009(1\u2009\u2212\u2009\u03b2). The corrected prevalence estimate from testing, pCor, is given by pCor\u2009=\u2009a\u2009+\u2009b\u2009\u00d7\u2009pObs, where a\u2009=\u2009(\u03b2\u2009\u2013\u20091)\u2009/\u2009(\u03b1\u2009+\u2009\u03b2\u2009\u2013\u20091) and b\u2009=\u20091\u2009/\u2009(\u03b1\u2009+\u2009\u03b2\u2009\u2013\u20091).\nSelecting sentinel sites with the largest observed prevalence (pObs) will yield the same site selections as choosing those with the largest corrected prevalence (pCor), which are the best estimates of the underlying true prevalence at each site. This will be true as long as the test sensitivity and specificity remain consistent.3\nWe have not emphasized contact tracing in our proposal. Contact tracing is absolutely needed at the beginning or end of an outbreak for containment. South Korea has used contact tracing, including the use of phone apps, to great effect. But even South Korea could not use contact tracing at the peak of their outbreak (which by comparison was a fraction of the population-adjusted outbreak in the US).\nFinally, this entire effort (and virtually all community testing) will be wasted if those found to have infections cannot be convinced to isolate in their homes or elsewhere. While the Centers for Disease Control have published guidance on this matter, these rules may not be understood by many members of the public. A well-run public awareness campaign in neighborhoods where infections are most likely is necessary. Perhaps a fund akin to jury duty reimbursement is required to cover the loss of income that could be incurred during home isolation.\nWe believe our plan provides the best hope of ending this outbreak and escaping from repeated cycles of imposing and releasing stay-at-home restrictions. Earlier modeling4 has shown that effectively isolating persons within 5 days after infection can indeed prevent sufficient transmission to bring the reproductive number of SARS-CoV-2 to less than unity. We need to prepare now, so this plan can be implemented as soon as feasible. Failure to do so may surrender our best hope of ending this outbreak.\nArticle Information\nCorresponding Author: Howard P.

It can be argued that the United States should have heeded more effectively the experiences of China, South Korea, Iran, and Italy and entered the pandemic in a less frenetic fashion, but that is not the way it happened. On February 1, 2020, there were 8 US confirmed cases, and 1 month later there were only 30. By March 18, there were 10\u202f442 confirmed cases.1 On that day, the American Academy of Ophthalmology, following advice from the US Surgeon General and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, issued the following guidance language: \u201cDue to the COVID-19 pandemic, the American Academy of Ophthalmology now finds it essential that all ophthalmologists cease providing any treatment other than urgent or emergent care immediately.\u201d2 It went on to state \u201cAll other factors\u2014business, finance, inconvenience, etc.\u2014are remotely secondary. This is an existential crisis.\u201d\nNever previously in the 124-year history of the Academy has it (with the support of its board of trustees) called for all US ophthalmologists to provide only care that in their judgment was urgent or emergent. Never had it called on the profession to markedly curtail medical commerce with its massive attendant effect on the lives and livelihood of ophthalmologists, their staff, and their families. Most notably, this was an open-ended recommendation; it did not specify when the unrestricted practice of ophthalmology would likely resume.\nBased on a survey of Academy members, our colleagues implemented the recommendations.3 All major subspecialty societies in ophthalmology endorsed it, other major specialty societies in other disciplines issued similar guidance, states began shelter-in-place notifications, and the need to conserve personal protective equipment and reduce virus transmission risk became more acute and obvious.\nMost practices markedly reduced the volume of office examinations, engaged in telemedicine when appropriate, and performed only urgent or emergent surgical procedures. Many furloughed or laid off staff. Some ophthalmologists were furloughed by their employers, including by private equity (PE) companies.\nWe now face another novel and complex challenge: reentering a more normal practice of ophthalmology. Much will no doubt be written about the new normal for medicine, but much will not change. Nearly all diseases are the same, and treatments for those diseases are generally unchanged. The basic delivery systems (ie, health insurance, facilities, and health resources) are still in place. But we likely will thrive as professionals only if we recognize those elements that will evolve. Physicians and patients will now bring different expectations to the clinical encounter.\nWhat else might be anticipated? Some practices will exit the acute COVID-19 period reasonably intact and will be able to offer patient care relatively quickly. However, many have been economically forced to furlough or lay off staff who are important to either the clinical or business side of the practice. These staff may no longer be available to rehire because they have moved, found other employment, or exited the workforce. Some of these practices, hopefully very few, will no longer be viable business entities.\nIn addition to issues of staffing and access to working capital, physicians in general (and ophthalmologists in particular, as they own smaller practices with high patient throughput) must manage new patient and staff expectations. Based on the recent COVID-19 experience, patients will expect and may demand less crowding in the office and waiting areas, shorter waiting times, line-of-sight access to hand sanitizer and handwashing facilities, more obvious handwashing by professional personnel, greater use of masks and face shields during close examination encounters, and continued use of larger slitlamp breath shields. Staff may have similar expectations. This will exert secondary pressure on scheduling templates and office architecture. Any residual demand for care will be partially offset by persistent fears of virus transmission.\nA novel issue to manage in the transition to post\u2013COVID-19 practice will be testing for the virus and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 antibodies. Until so-called herd immunity is achieved, it will be valuable, and perhaps essential, to know the antibody status of physicians, staff, and patients who are scheduled for procedures. This presumes the widespread availability of reasonably priced and reliable, validated tests.\nOther COVID-19\u2013associated issues will evolve over months and years. These will include changes in medical education at all levels involving public health, disaster management, and cross-specialty education. Medical societies, including the American Academy of Ophthalmology, must adapt to provide this and it may become a part of routine facility reprivileging.\nInsurance markets will change, with renewed attention given to precise contract-specific definitions of force majeure and business interruption insurance. Professional liability insurance will more commonly include clauses to specifically cover telemedical services and disaster-associated professional services outside of a physician\u2019s specific specialty and the primary state of medical practice.\nThe increasing corporatization of ophthalmology practices likely will be changed by the COVID-19 experience. Several PE companies furloughed or laid off some of their ophthalmologist employees and recommended they file for unemployment insurance. It may affect the way physicians view PE practice ownership. On the other hand, practices eager for capital and management expertise may be attracted to better-run PE firms with ready access to capital despite lower valuations.\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, nonphysician clinicians, including advanced practice nurses, certified registered nurse anesthetists, and physician assistants, have been temporarily permitted to perform certain procedures without physician supervision to expand the workforce surge capacity. Some of these groups are already advocating for permanently extending these regulations.4,5\nOphthalmology has been a national leader in telemedicine augmented by technology and artificial intelligence. On March 30, 2020, the US Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services released temporary regulatory waivers and issued new rules for virtual visits using online applications for billable telemedical services.6 Such low-technology solutions may be one mechanism to assist with decompressing an office schedule in the post-COVID era. We can anticipate accelerated interest in patient-facing monitoring devices, rapid point-of-care diagnostics, electronic health record\u2013linked application programming interface development, and artificial intelligence\u2013fueled analytics.\nFinally, research into coronaviruses will be prioritized in the coming months. It may also be accompanied by changes in US Food and Drug Administration regulations to permit more rapid clinical trials and approval pathways. This will be relevant not just for drug and device approval but also for testing kits and vaccine development. Within ophthalmology, we may see not only the ophthalmic implications of these changes but also renewed interest in population-based research in topics as diverse as preocular tear film viral transmissibility and in social determinants of eye health. Throughout all of medicine there will be scrutiny of issues, such as sole sourcing of critical drugs and devices and incentivizing the domestic production of key molecules.\nThe initiation into the COVID-19 pandemic was relatively sudden and very tragic. It was also massively disruptive to the practice of ophthalmology. Our profession soon will be exiting the acute phase of the pandemic and recommencing a fuller spectrum of patient care. Success will depend in part on recognizing and managing the scientific changes introduced by COVID-19 and the accompanying societal expectations for rapid evolution in health care delivery.\nBack to top\nArticle Information\nCorresponding Author: David W.

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is likely to result in year-over-year changes in both health care spending and GDP that are without precedent. Because the ratio of these 2 numbers, the share of health care in the GDP, receives so much attention in public policy, it is worth thinking about how large these changes may be, and more importantly, what they mean.\nThe first step in projecting how COVID-19 may affect the health share of the GDP is to estimate how COVID-19 will affect health care spending. This will depend on the future extent, timing, and composition of the pandemic, so it is highly uncertain.\nOn one hand, in regions with a great deal of COVID-19 disease, hospitals are operating at or over capacity. The federal government, states, and hospitals have rushed to purchase ventilators and personal protective equipment and have taken bold steps to facilitate hiring of recent medical school graduates, retired medical workers, and physicians and nurses with out-of-state licenses. This surge in demand will drive up health care spending over the coming months. The range of estimates of the costs of this surge is very wide\u2014somewhere between $34 billion and $500 billion in added private insurance spending, or between 3% and 40% of current spending,2,3 and between $7 billion and $30 billion each in additional spending for the Medicare and Medicaid programs, or between 1% and 5% of current spending in these programs.1 The differences in the percentage increases between private and public programs arise in part because baseline spending per enrolled person is much greater in public insurance, in part because per capita costs for COVID-19 are much lower in public insurance, and in part, in the case of Medicaid, because children and young adults have had lower rates of COVID-19 illness. All of these estimates depend critically on how many people are ultimately affected.\nOn the other hand, many clinicians have seen the demand for their services substantially decline or vanish altogether. Dentists, primary care physicians, outpatient service practitioners and centers, surgical specialists, and hospital departments that focus on elective procedures have all seen very sharp declines in demand. Between January and March, overall employment in health care actually decreased. Here, the timing of the pandemic is critical. If the pandemic is well controlled soon, the use of these services may simply be shifted into the fall. If not, many of the services (ie, visits and procedures) may never happen. These reductions in spending would offset at least a portion of the increased COVID-19\u2013related expenditures.\nUncertainty about the composition of the pandemic-affected population further complicates the projections. Will those hospitalized be covered by Medicare, Medicaid, or private insurance\u2014or will they be uninsured? The COVID-19 pandemic highlights the stunning differences in the prices paid by private and public payers in the US health care system. Commercial health insurers pay nearly 4 times as much for the kinds of care COVID-19 patients require than Medicare does, and nearly 5 times as much as Medicaid does.3 If the burden of this disease is disproportionately borne by poor and elderly persons, which appears to be the case, the effects on national health spending will be much lower than if most hospitalized cases are reimbursed through private insurance. In addition, if increased unemployment leads to large increases in the number of US residents who are uninsured, particularly in states that have not yet expanded Medicaid, non\u2013COVID-19 health care spending may decline even after the pandemic is under control. The current employment-based health insurance system, combined with the lack of a coverage safety net, will exacerbate the effects of the pandemic on the most vulnerable people.\nThe midpoint of these various estimates suggests that the pandemic might plausibly lead to national health spending in 2020 that is 10% higher than in 2019. If GDP were unchanged, this increase in health care spending alone would increase the share of GDP devoted to health care spending by 10%; the share would increase from the current 17.8% to 19.6% in a single year.\nBut the effect of COVID-19 on the ratio of health care spending to GDP is likely to be even greater because of the consequences of the pandemic for the denominator: the nation\u2019s output. The effect of COVID-19 on output likewise depends on the course of the pandemic and whether demand returns in the second half of the year. Current forecasts, which generally anticipate a resumption of economic activity by summer or fall, nonetheless project declines in GDP of between 2.4% and 8.7% for 2020 relative to 2019.4,5\nMathematically, an 8.7% reduction in GDP\u2014unimaginable as recently as last month\u2014would increase the ratio of health spending to GDP by 1.7 percentage points, even if health spending did not change. Combining a 10% increase in the numerator (health spending) and an 8.7% reduction in the denominator (GDP) yields a 20% increase in the ratio of the two. In other words, health care spending would increase by 3.7 percentage points, from 17.7% of GDP to 21.4% of GDP, in a single year. This 1-year change would be nearly twice as large as the 10-year forecast provided by the CMS actuaries just before the pandemic happened.1 Even if the decline in GDP is just 2.4%, reflecting an economy that moves quickly in the fall to make up ground lost in the spring, health care would comprise 20% of GDP next year, well above the amount projected for 2028.\nAlthough these increases will inevitably attract substantial attention, it is critical to think through what these estimates do and do not mean.\nThe first consideration is the likely level of health spending in 2021 (the numerator). This amount will likely increase relative to last year, but, in present circumstances, it would be better if it were higher still: if more personal protective equipment were available, if ventilators were not in short supply, and, critically, if there were more effective ways to reduce morbidity and mortality among patients with COVID-19. Some of the care that will have been deferred or forgone is likely of low value, but much is surely not. It would be better if it had not been necessary to put off the useful elective procedures and routine care now deferred by the crisis. It would be better if people did not lose access to health insurance as they lost their jobs. The pandemic highlights that it is a mistake to think of health care spending as \u201cbad\u201d: a curve that must be bent. Some care is wasteful because it pays for care that is ineffective; but much care is not. The imperative to develop tools that will identify high-value care and design payment systems that reward that care is as strong as ever. The imperative to ensure that prices accurately reflect value is as strong as ever.\nThe second consideration is what will happen to GDP (the denominator). Slower growth in GDP has affected the ratio of health care to GDP in the past; between 2008 and 2009, health care as a share of GDP increased from 16.3% to 17.2%. But in that case, as in most earlier years, the evolution of GDP and that of health care spending were largely independent, except perhaps through the effects of unemployment on insurance coverage. The COVID-19 pandemic situation reflects an even deeper linkage. The cost of treating patients with COVID-19 is the smallest component of the economic burden of the pandemic. The much greater costs are the human consequence of disease for individuals and their families and the enormous cost of the precautions taken by individuals and societies to avoid this disease.6 Most of the economic costs of the pandemic are outside the health care system. In hindsight, it would have been well worth spending much more on health care, particularly in the form of disaster and pandemic preparedness, to control the pandemic and allow the economy to restart.\nBack to top\nArticle Information\nCorresponding Author: Sherry Glied, PhD, Robert F.

Lacking robust trial evidence, clinicians are forced to consider all options based on preclinical and small observational studies, often in heart-wrenching settings of patients who are deteriorating in the throes of severe pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, cytokine storm, and in many cases, cardiovascular complications.\nAmong possible therapies, hydroxychloroquine has been advocated and even politicized as a promising therapy because of its anti-inflammatory and potential antiviral properties. The drug, known for its immunosuppressive and antimalarial effects, has risen to the top of many treatment algorithms alone or in combination with azithromycin. Hydroxychloroquine was first approved in 1955 by the US Food and Drug Administration and has been viewed as generally safe and well-tolerated in patients treated for chronic inflammatory conditions. However, hydroxychloroquine prolongs the QT interval because of blockade of inward cellular potassium current and has a known risk of proarrhythmia,1-3 especially in the setting of other drugs that also prolong the QT interval. Drug-induced QT prolongation has long been considered a surrogate for risk of drug-associated torsades de pointes.4 Although widely used, azithromycin has also been increasingly recognized for risks of QT interval prolongation and sudden death.5 Opinions vary regarding the optimal dose of hydroxychloroquine and stopping points based on corrected QT (QTc) prolongation. In patients with COVID-19, there may be greater risk tolerance among clinicians for QTc prolongation and toxicity in patients who are very sick, but at the same time, there may be an increased risk of ventricular arrhythmias because of electrolyte abnormalities, hypoxia, concomitant QT-prolonging medications, and underlying cardiovascular disease.6,7 The risk-benefit trade off of hydroxychloroquine may also depend on whether other drugs with unclear benefit (such as remdesivir and tocilizumab) are available as alternative therapies.\nGiven the paucity of evidence of benefit and risk for treating COVID-19 with hydroxychloroquine alone or with azithromycin, the findings of Bessi\u00e8re and coworkers8 and Mercuro and coworkers9 are welcome and important. These reports from Lyon, France, and Boston, Massachusetts, provide concordant insights regarding the potential for QTc prolongation with this treatment in patients hospitalized with COVID-19. Excessive prolongation of QTc was observed in 14 of 40 patients (36%) in an intensive care unit, as reported by Bessi\u00e8re et al,8 with cutoffs defined either as an increase in QTc of 60 milliseconds or more (in 10 patients [25%]) or prolongation of QTc of 500 milliseconds or more (7 patients [18%]). What is most striking, however, are the paired data demonstrating that 37 of 40 patients (93%) manifested an increase in QTc with hydroxychloroquine alone or in combination with azithromycin.8\nSimilarly, in the cohort reported by Mercuro et al,9 18 of 90 patients (20%) treated with hydroxychloroquine alone or in combination with azithromycin developed QTc prolongation of 500 milliseconds or more. The magnitude of increase in QTc compared with baseline values was more pronounced in those treated with both agents. One-third of the hospitalized patients in this series were treated in an intensive care unit. As with the observations of Bessi\u00e8re et al,8 paired data show that QTc increased in most patients, particularly in those treated with concomitant azithromycin.9\nIn patients being treated in the hospital for COVID-19, especially in an intensive care setting, there are a number of confounding factors, noted previously, including electrolyte alterations, other drugs, heart failure, and cardiac ischemia; thus, these findings may not be generalizable to other settings in patients who are less acutely ill, as the authors note.8,9 The fact that no episodes of torsades de pointes were observed by Bessi\u00e8re et al8 is likely because hydroxychloroquine (with or without azithromycin) was stopped using generally accepted cut points; however, 1 patient reported by Mercuro et al developed torsades de pointes 3 days after the combination of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin was discontinued because of a QTc interval of 499 milliseconds.9 Allowing treatment beyond these limits to even longer QTc intervals in patients with COVID-19 should not be recommended unless there are clear benefits associated with anti-inflammatory or antiviral effects that are yet to be clinically demonstrated.\nIt is also true that, in an intensive care unit, the QTc can be safely monitored in most patients receiving hydroxycholoroquine and azithromycin. However, the data showing increases in QTc in more than 90% of patients treated with these agents by Bessi\u00e8re et al8 and in most patients reported by Mercuro et al,9 coupled with similar findings with chloroquine diphosphate in a Brazilian trial,10 underscore the potential risk associated with widespread use of hydroxychloroquine and the combination of hydroxycholoquine and azithromycin in ambulatory patients with known or suspected COVID-19.11 Understanding whether this risk is worth taking in the absence of evidence of therapeutic efficacy creates a knowledge gap that needs to be addressed. Whether signals of potential benefit outweigh signals of harm is unknown until well-controlled clinical trials are completed for the treatment or prevention of COVID-19 infections. Two such studies are the Outcomes Related to COVID-19 Treated With Hydroxychloroquine Among In-patients With Symptomatic Disease (ORCHID) trial (NCT04332991)12 and the Randomized Evaluation of COVID-19 Therapy (RECOVERY) trial (ISRCTN50189673),13 which will also have ongoing safety reviews. Until then, treatment decisions for this disease will remain based on clinical judgment and, ideally, in the context of enrolling patients into clinical trials to provide definitive answers.\nBack to top\nArticle Information\nCorresponding Author: Robert O.

While social distancing and good hand hygiene are the most important methods to prevent virus transmission, new guidelines state that healthy individuals can consider wearing masks in public settings, particularly when physical distancing is difficult (like in grocery stores or pharmacies). Primary benefits of wearing a mask include limiting the spread of the virus from someone who knows or does not know they have an infection to others. Masks also remind others to continue practicing physical distancing. However, nonmedical masks may not be effective in preventing infection for the person wearing them. Masks should not be worn by children younger than 2 years or by individuals who are unable to remove the mask by themselves or are unconscious.\nWhat Kind of Face Mask Can I Wear?\nUnless you are sick, a health care worker, or caring for someone who has COVID-19, medical masks (including surgical face masks and N95s) are not recommended. Because of shortages, medical masks should be prioritized for health care workers providing care for patients. Cloth face coverings can be made from household items such as 2 layers of cotton fabric, T-shirts, bandanas, or bedsheets. Masks should be secured with ear loops or ties. Whatever material a face mask is made from, it should fit well and cover the nose and mouth. The mask should not restrict the wearer\u2019s ability to breathe.\nHow Do I Wear a Face Mask?\nBefore putting on a face mask, wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds or use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer (with at least 60% alcohol). Without touching the front of the mask, secure the ties behind your ears or head. While wearing the mask, do not touch the mask or your face. When removing the mask, take off the ear loops or ties first. Do not touch the front of the mask or your face when removing the mask. After removing the mask wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds (or use hand sanitizer). Face masks should be washed routinely with soap and water or laundry detergent to prevent contamination. Wearing a mask in public should always be accompanied by remaining at least 6 feet away from others and practicing good hand hygiene.\nFor More Information\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention\nwww.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/diy-cloth-face-coverings.html\nThe JAMA Patient Page is a public service of JAMA.

This is even more relevant for critically ill patients who are particularly exposed to electrolyte imbalance and/or drugs leading to an increased risk of QT prolongation.6 Therefore, we aimed to examine the safety of hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin regarding QT interval in ICU patients with COVID-19.\nMethods\nThis study was approved by our institutional ethics committee (Comit\u00e9 d\u2019Ethique du CHU de Lyon) with a waiver for informed consent because of the retrospective nature of the study. All consecutive patients with COVID-19 confirmed by positive reverse transcription\u2013polymerase chain reaction results on respiratory samples admitted to the ICU who received hydroxychloroquine (200 mg, twice a day, for 10 days) with or without azithromycin (250 mg, daily, for 5 days) were included. Treatment began in the absence of contraindication, including corrected QT (QTc) intervals greater than 460 milliseconds (Bazett formula). All other drugs (given before or after ICU admission) listed in CredibleMeds (https://crediblemeds.org) with known or possible risk of QT prolongation/torsades de pointes were classified as drugs favoring prolonged QT. The QTc interval was continuously monitored; an electrocardiogram (ECG) was recorded daily. All ECGs were retrospectively reviewed by 2 masked cardiac electrophysiologists. As previously described, prolonged QTc was defined as an increase in QTc intervals of more than 60 milliseconds (\u0394QTc >60 milliseconds) compared with baseline or as a QTc of 500 milliseconds or greater.4 Data, expressed as median (interquartile range [IQR]) and number (percentage), were compared using Mann-Whitney U, Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed rank, or Fisher exact tests as appropriate.\nResults\nForty patients with COVID-19 (median age, 68 years [IQR, 58-74 years]; 32 men [80%]) were included between March 15 and March 29, 2020 (Table). Thirty patients (75%) required invasive mechanical ventilation and 25 (63%) received vasoactive drugs (Table). Hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin was given to 18 (45%) and 22 patients (55%), respectively. Twenty patients (50%) also received other treatments favoring QT prolongation in the ICU (Table). Most patients (37 [93%]) showed an increase in QTc after the administration of antiviral therapy (Figure). Prolonged QTc was observed in 14 patients (36%) (10 with \u0394QTc >60 milliseconds and 7 with QTc \u2265500 milliseconds) after a duration of antiviral treatment of 2 to 5 days. No ventricular arrhythmia, including torsades de pointes, was recorded. As shown in the Figure, among patients treated with hydroxychloroquine\u2009and\u2009azithromycin, 6 of 18 (33%) developed an increase in QTc of 500 milliseconds or greater vs 1 of 22 (5%) of those treated with hydroxychloroquine alone (P\u2009=\u2009.03). The antiviral treatment ceased before completion for 7 patients (17.5%) following ECG abnormalities and in 10 (25%) for acute renal failure.\nDiscussion\nThis study raises safety concerns about the use of hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin for patients with COVID-19, particularly when both drugs are administered together. There were no baseline clinical factors associated with subsequent QT prolongation. In our cohort, close monitoring of patients (including continuous QTc interval monitoring, daily ECGs, and laboratory tests), which led to an interruption of these drugs for 17 patients (42.5%), may have averted further complications, including drug-induced torsades de pointes. Key limitations of the present case series include a potential lack of generalizability beyond the ICU. However, the finding that QTc intervals increased in more than 90% of patients raises concerns about the widespread use of hydroxychloroquine, with or without azithromycin, to treat COVID-19 in settings where patients cannot be adequately monitored.\nBack to top\nArticle Information\nAccepted for Publication: April 14, 2020\nCorresponding Author: Martin Cour, MD, PhD, M\u00e9decine Intensive-R\u00e9animation, H\u00f4pital Edouard Herriot, 5, Place d\u2019Arsonval, 69437 Lyon Cedex 03, France (martin.cour@chu-lyon.fr).\nPublished Online: May 1, 2020. doi:10.1001/jamacardio.2020.1787\nAuthor Contributions: Drs Bessi\u00e8re and Cour had full access to all of the data in the study and take responsibility for the integrity of the data and the accuracy of the data analysis.\nConcept and design: Bessiere, Roccia, Chevalier, Argaud, Cour.\nAcquisition, analysis, or interpretation of data: Bessiere, Roccia, Deliniere, Charriere, Chevalier, Cour.\nDrafting of the manuscript: Bessiere, Roccia, Chevalier, Cour.\nCritical revision of the manuscript for important intellectual content: Bessiere, Roccia, Deliniere, Charriere, Argaud, Cour.\nStatistical analysis: Bessiere, Cour.\nSupervision: Bessiere, Deliniere, Chevalier, Argaud, Cour.\nConflict of Interest Disclosures: None reported.\nAdditional Contributions: We thank Verena Landel, DRCI, Hospices Civils de Lyon, for her help in manuscript preparation.

As the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus that causes COVID-19 gains entry into cells via binding to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor,2,3 concerns have been raised that these therapies might facilitate the transmission of the virus or affect outcomes adversely.4-6 Given that ACEI and ARB therapies are known to provide benefit for the underlying conditions treated, stopping ACEI/ARB therapy carries risks. Moreover, local inactivation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system may have protective effects against the development and progression of acute lung failure.3 In the absence of clinical evidence of benefit or risk of ACEIs/ARBs, current societal statements recommend against discontinuing these drugs other than for standard clinical indications.7 Robust clinical data are needed to clarify the effect of ACEIs/ARBs on SARS-CoV-2 infection.\nMehta et al8 address this question in a cohort of 18\u202f472 patients who were tested for COVID-19 between March 8 and April 20, 2020, at 2 centers in the Cleveland Clinic Health System. Among them, 2285 (12.4%) were either taking an ACEI or ARB. After overlap weighting based on a propensity score,9 no association was observed between ACEI/ARB status and testing positive (odds ratio [OR], 1.09; 95% CI, 0.87-1.37). These results, in a contemporary sample, support the current recommendations of professional societies to continue ACEI or ARB therapy7 because there was no signal that these agents increase susceptibility to contracting COVID-19. However, secondary analyses conducted in a smaller sample of 1735 individuals who tested positive for COVID-19 showed a significant association between ACEI/ARB treatment and hospitalization (OR, 1.93; 95% CI, 1.38-2.71) and need for care in an intensive care unit (ICU) (OR, 1.64; 95% CI, 1.07 - 2.51), suggesting greater severity of disease in those who tested positive. Despite statistical significance, these secondary results need to be interpreted with caution. To better understand the strengths and weaknesses of each analysis, we review them with respect to key considerations in comparative effectiveness research, including confounding, generalizability, selection bias, treatment misclassification, and precision (Table).\nTable.  Key Considerations in Comparative Effectiveness Research Applied to Study of Mehta et al8\nView LargeDownload\nAs in many observational comparisons, which lack randomization to balance out patient characteristics across treatment groups, patients taking ACEIs/ARBs in the study by Mehta et al8 had much higher prevalence of coronary artery disease, heart failure and cardiovascular risk factors, as well as chronic obstructive lung disease. To address this problem of confounding, the authors used overlap weighting based on a propensity score that included age, sex, obesity, diabetes, coronary artery disease, chronic lung disease, hypertension, and heart failure. After adjustment, there were no differences in the measured comorbidities, on average, between groups taking ACEIs/ARBs and groups not taking ACEIs/ARBs. To be successful, this analysis should include all important confounders. Confounders are variables associated with both ACEI/ARB treatment and outcome, ie, a positive COVID-19 test result. Factors associated with ACEI/ARB treatment assignment include cardiovascular disease or risk factors, chronic kidney disease, and other comorbidities. Factors associated with becoming infected with COVID-19 are less known. All people are susceptible to novel viruses, and transmission is strongly related to social interaction. Social distancing decreases transmission rates, particularly in vulnerable populations that are encouraged to self-isolate. Therefore, factors that identify vulnerable populations10 may affect COVID-19 transmission indirectly through behavior. According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, vulnerable groups include older age (>65 years), serious heart conditions, chronic kidney disease, and other serious health conditions.10 Thus, the primary analysis of the study by Mehta et al8 is appropriately adjusted for important confounders, with the possible exception of chronic kidney disease (a variable related to ACEI/ARB treatment and high risk in the setting of COVID-19).\nIn the secondary analysis, the confounders are variables associated with both ACEI/ARB treatment and outcome, ie, hospitalization and ICU admission. As before, cardiovascular disease or risk factors and other comorbidities may be associated with receiving ACEIs/ARBs. In addition, these factors may directly affect the outcomes of hospitalization and ICU admission with older, frail, and sick patients having worse outcomes. An indirect effect is also plausible, in which the presence of cardiovascular disease and other comorbidities lowers the threshold on the part of referring clinicians to hospitalize and move to the ICU those individuals considered to be at higher risk than the general population. The secondary analysis of Mehta et al8 was adjusted for age and cardiovascular disease and risk factors, but residual and/or unmeasured confounding is likely, and decisions of clinicians to hospitalize selected patients cannot be accounted for.\nUntil testing for SARS-CoV-2 becomes widespread, studies such as the one by Mehta et al8 are inherently limited to a select group of individuals who are tested. This selection process affects generalizability and can induce bias in treatment comparisons. Generalizability refers to how broadly the conclusions can be applied, that is, to what target population?11 The protocol for testing in the study by Mehta et al8 prioritized older patients and those with cardiovascular disease or risk factors, end-stage kidney disease, and the other conditions identified as high risk by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.10 While not generalizable to all patients in the US, the results of this study are applicable to a relatively high-risk target population, for whom any incremental risk owing to ACEI/ARB would be important to identify. The secondary analysis is further conditioned on testing positive for COVID-19.\nSelection of individuals based on testing can also create bias in the comparison of treatments. In the primary analysis, selection bias will occur if there are factors associated with ACEI/ARB treatment that also make testing more likely (selection). This is similar to confounding, except that the bias arises owing to common causes of ACEI/ARB and testing, rather than common causes of ACEI/ARB and outcome. Among the reasons for testing (listed above), cardiovascular disease or risk factors and kidney disease are most likely to be associated with ACEI/ARB use. Selection bias owing to these factors is addressed by propensity score overlap weighting. Importantly, COVID-19 symptoms are also likely to induce testing. These should not be included in adjustment because they are part of the outcome (having COVID-19). In the secondary analysis, selection bias may occur if there are factors associated with ACEI/ARB treatment and either phase of selection: (1) testing and (2) positive diagnosis. Again, the list of comorbidities is the same as above and they are adjusted for in the propensity score (except for kidney disease). In general, until there is widespread and generalized testing in unselected populations, studies conducted in patients tested for COVID-19 should adjust for patient comorbidities that affect testing in addition to traditional confounders.\nTreatment status can be defined in various ways, particularly as patients switch over time and in response to COVID-19. Treatment misclassification occurs when the available treatment status is inaccurate for an alternative, superior definition. Mehta et al8 define treatment based on whether ACEIs/ARBs were recorded in the electronic medical record at the time of testing for SARS-CoV-2. One advantage to this approach is that it may reflect recent use, during the period of potential viral exposure. For the primary analysis, this corresponds closely to the proposed causal mechanism, associated with upregulation of ACE2. However, the secondary analysis evaluates outcomes after a positive test result. For this analysis, it is unclear whether patients continue to take ACEIs/ARBs after being tested, particularly after hospitalization. Generally, studies of treatment during COVID-19 should carefully consider whether treatment changes are relevant to the scientific hypothesis.\nThe primary analysis of Mehta et al8 achieves good precision (ie, reasonably narrow confidence intervals) owing to the large sample size and the use of propensity score overlap weighting. Overlap weighting has been shown to maximize precision among a large class of propensity score methods.9,12 Precision is important to this analysis because the conclusion of no association is best justified by narrow confidence intervals around an odds ratio of 1.0. The secondary analysis has lower precision (ie, wider confidence intervals) owing to a smaller sample size.\nMehta et al8 provide important clinical data to support current treatment recommendations regarding use in ACEIs/ARBs in the current COVID-19 pandemic. Despite the limitations of observational data and the unique challenges of conducting studies in the setting of COVID-19, the primary analysis is consistent with good observational research. Future research is needed to replicate these findings as testing becomes more widespread and/or additionally adjust for factors related to testing that were not available here. The authors\u2019 interpretation of the secondary outcomes analysis is appropriately restrained. The observed associations are likely \u201creal\u201d but are likely explained by confounding and should not be inferred as causal.\nBack to top\nArticle Information\nCorresponding Author: Laine Elliott Thomas, PhD, Biostatistics and Bioinformatics, Duke Clinical Research Institute, 200 Morris, Durham, NC 27701 (laine.thomas@duke.edu).\nPublished Online: May 5, 2020. doi:10.1001/jamacardio.2020.1874\nConflict of Interest Disclosures: Dr Pencina reports past grants from Sanofi/Regeneron and Amgen to his institution, lecture fees from Merck, and previously serving on the advisory board of Boehringer Ingelheim outside the submitted work.

Although the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic may not involve many trips to the operating room, the lessons learned in organizational management of prior natural disasters, mass shootings, and transportation incidents are valuable. At our institution, more than a quarter of patients who initially present with COVID-19 have been intubated, requiring multiple, time-consuming bedside procedures for hemodynamic monitoring and central venous access. As the hospital architecture has changed to suit the demands of the coronavirus pandemic, its workforce has also needed to evolve.\nIn response, the surgical residency has created a special team, the surgical workforce activation team (SWAT), to help offload procedural work from the other emergency medicine, critical care, and medicine departments. The mission of the SWAT is to build and deploy a specialized team of clinicians with the skill set to efficiently perform bedside procedures in an effort to support our colleagues, reduce health care personnel exposure, preserve personal protective equipment, and provide quality care to patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. We have performed common, time-consuming procedures, including setting up central catheters, arterial catheters, and dialysis catheters, thereby alleviating the workflow of intensive care unit (ICU) teams.\nPreparation\nAs we set up the SWAT, we sought to create a process-driven team available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week (in two 12-hour shifts a day). Each team consists of 2 senior surgical residents, a surgical intern, and a surgical attending physician. Attending physicians are from diverse backgrounds that have included trauma, acute care, hepatobiliary, colorectal, vascular, and pediatric surgery and even interventional radiology.\nFirst, we developed an encrypted central messaging system to contact the SWAT through multiple modes of communication: telephone and the electronic medical record. The ICU and emergency department teams can order a SWAT consult within the electronic medical record or send a message to a dedicated pager. As a patient is admitted to an ICU or following intubation in the emergency department, the primary team orders the SWAT consult and includes the access type desired, with a telephone number for a call back.\nNext, we have created our own central supply of materials in concert with the anesthesia department and hospital supply managers to avoid depleting the ICU and floor supply closets. We have obtained 3 portable ultrasonography machines from the anesthesia and vascular surgery departments. We have developed a system to ensure the availability of SWAT go bags, which contain all materials we have deemed necessary for 1 patient (Box).\nBox.\nDetails of Surgical Workforce Activation Team Go Bag Contents\nMain Pocket\n1 Each\n18F Salem Sump nasogastric tube\nFoley catheter insertion kit\nTape roll for securing the nasogastric tube\n20-Gauge\u2009\u00d7\u20091 \u00be-inch arterial catheter\nChlorhexidine gluconate dressing\nBlue disposable underpad\nPack of 4\u2009\u00d7\u20094-inch gauze\n3-0 Nylon suture\n7F, 3-lumen central venous catheterization kit\nUltrasonography probe cover\n2 Each\nSurgilube surgical lubricant packets\nChlorhexidine preparation sticks\n3 Each\nLuer lock adapters (1-link, needle-free intravenous connector)\nSide Pocket\nExtra arterial catheters, as above\nArterial catheter free wire\nArterial catheter pressure transducer and pressure bag\nSterile gloves (in sizes 6.5, 7.0, and 7.5)\n2 Additional chlorhexidine preparation sticks\n2 Nonsterile saline, 0.9%, flush injections\nAs the final step of preparation, we promoted the SWAT with flyers at every ICU and emergency department nursing station. We have also ensured that the anesthesia, critical care, and emergency department teams are aware of the procedural services by sending announcements via their departmental listservs.\nActivation\nAfter receiving a request for a bedside procedure, the team verifies the indication for the procedure, as well as any contraindications. If the patient has recently been intubated, we wait for 30 minutes afterward to ensure aerosolized virus particles have cleared the patient\u2019s vicinity. A family member is contacted by the primary team or SWAT to provide consent for the procedure.\nWe have found that sending 2 team members to each procedure allows for 1 resident physician to act as the proceduralist and the other to act as an assistant located outside the room. Generally, the proceduralist is a senior surgery resident (program year 3 or higher), and the assistant is a surgical intern. This allows the minimization of personal protective equipment and excessive supply use, which is key in the current setting of disrupted supply chains and shortages. During the procedures, the proceduralist wears an N95 mask covered by a surgical mask (to extend its lifetime), an eye shield, a surgical gown, a bouffant head covering, and sterile gloves, which are donned and doffed appropriately. The assistant and supervising attending physician typically remain outside the patient room with the SWAT go bag. The proceduralist then brings in the minimum amount of supplies needed, and the assistant is available outside the room to pass in any additional supplies to the proceduralist as needed. The attending physician supervises all procedures and participates if needed.\nA high incidence of acute kidney injury has been described in patients infected with COVID-19. Based on availability, we place a triple-lumen dialysis catheter on the right side of the neck in patients in whom there is a high suspicion for possible kidney therapy in the future. When this has been possible, we have preferentially placed central venous catheters in the left internal jugular vein, preserving the right internal jugular vein for future dialysis catheter placement to achieve optimal flow rates. Femoral catheters have generally been avoided because of the inherently higher risk of thrombotic and infectious complications.1 The patients have required multiple lumens because of requirements for pressor, sedation, and paralytic medications. As a result, the policy is to always place triple-lumen catheters.\nBecause of considerable shortages of disposable equipment, we have been quite minimalistic in the supplies used. We have used the 18-gauge syringe included in the central catheter kit rather than adding a micropuncture kit. Each proceduralist is expected to establish proper venous cannulation prior to use. We have required visualization of the guidewire in the vein with ultrasonography in a cross-sectional and longitudinal view prior to dilation.2 Using extension tubing to create a venous manometer is accepted as well.3 These safety considerations are crucial when portable radiography machines and technologists are in short supply because of high patient volume.\nBundling procedures is an efficient way to minimize personal protective equipment usage and personnel exposed to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus. We have preferred to place indwelling urinary catheters, orogastric or nasogastric tubes, arterial catheters, and central catheters at the same encounter to prevent multiple staff members from entering the room at different times. We have also requested that if we are called for these procedures immediately after intubation, only 1 chest radiograph is performed at the culmination of all these procedures. This policy minimizes the need for radiology technicians to have repeated exposures and patients to have multiple radiographs.\nPostprocedural Follow-up\nImmediately following the procedure, a procedure note is written, including the procedure type and catheter location, size (French), and length. If a chest radiograph is performed following a procedure, the proceduralist resident is responsible for following up its reading. All chest radiographs are also read by a board-certified radiologist. If a pneumothorax is found after catheter placement or intubation, our team can place a chest tube. Each patient is added to a master database, which will be used for continuous quality improvement going forward.\nIf applicable, Current Procedural Terminology billing codes are applied to the procedure note, and it is signed by the attending proceduralist. The billing code allows a surgical department to show productivity despite the COVID-19 pandemic, in case reimbursement is based on revenue value units.\nIn the first 7 days of the SWAT\u2019s work during the COVID-19 pandemic, we received 174 consult requests and placed 137 central catheters and dialysis catheters, 77 arterial catheters, 2 paracentesis catheters, 2 laceration repairs, and 1 chest tube. Initial feedback from colleagues in the ICUs and emergency department has been overwhelmingly positive, with many emphasizing their ability to focus on patient care without the burden of time-consuming procedures.\nThe SWAT has become an integral part of our hospital\u2019s response to the COVID-19 epidemic. Strategic appropriation of resources will be key to a community\u2019s success in treating the virus. Our technique of using surgical staff as a rapidly deployed access team is an efficient use of staffing, personal protective equipment, and supplies that will aid in the treatment of all patients.\nBack to top\nArticle Information\nCorresponding Author: Barbara E.

Personal protective equipment (PPE) samples from study physicians exiting the patient rooms also were collected. Sterile premoistened swabs were used.\nAir sampling was done on 2 days using SKC Universal pumps (with 37-mm filter cassettes and 0.3-\u03bcm polytetrafluoroethylene filters for 4 hours at 5 L/min) in the room and anteroom and a Sartorius MD8 microbiological sampler (with gelatin membrane filter for 15 minutes at 6 m3/h) outside the room (eFigure in the Supplement).\nSpecific real-time reverse transcriptase\u2013polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) targeting RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and E genes4 was used to detect the presence of SARS-CoV-2 (see detailed methods in the eAppendix in the Supplement). Cycle threshold values, ie, number of cycles required for the fluorescent signal to cross the threshold in RT-PCR, quantified viral load, with lower values indicating higher viral load.\nSamples were collected on 5 days over a 2-week period. One patient\u2019s room was sampled before routine cleaning and 2 patients\u2019 rooms after routine cleaning. Twice-daily cleaning of high-touch areas was done using 5000 ppm of sodium dichloroisocyanurate. The floor was cleaned daily using 1000 ppm of sodium dichloroisocyanurate.\nClinical data (symptoms, day of illness, and RT-PCR results) and timing of cleaning were collected and correlated with sampling results. Percentage positivity was calculated for rooms with positive environmental swabs. Institutional review board approval and written informed consent were obtained as part of a larger multicenter study.\nResults\nPatient A\u2019s room was sampled on days 4 and 10 of illness while the patient was still symptomatic, after routine cleaning. All samples were negative. Patient B was symptomatic on day 8 and asymptomatic on day 11 of illness; samples taken on these 2 days after routine cleaning were negative (Table 1).\nPatient C, whose samples were collected before routine cleaning, had positive results, with 13 (87%) of 15 room sites (including air outlet fans) and 3 (60%) of 5 toilet sites (toilet bowl, sink, and door handle) returning positive results (Table 2). Anteroom and corridor samples were negative. Patient C had upper respiratory tract involvement with no pneumonia and had 2 positive stool samples for SARS-CoV-2 on RT-PCR despite not having diarrhea.\nPatient C had greater viral shedding, with a cycle threshold value of 25.69 in nasopharyngeal samples compared with 31.31 and 35.33 in patients A and B (Table 1).\nOnly 1 PPE swab, from the surface of a shoe front, was positive. All other PPE swabs were negative. All air samples were negative.\nDiscussion\nThere was extensive environmental contamination by 1 SARS-CoV-2 patient with mild upper respiratory tract involvement. Toilet bowl and sink samples were positive, suggesting that viral shedding in stool5 could be a potential route of transmission. Postcleaning samples were negative, suggesting that current decontamination measures are sufficient.\nAir samples were negative despite the extent of environmental contamination. Swabs taken from the air exhaust outlets tested positive, suggesting that small virus-laden droplets may be displaced by airflows and deposited on equipment such as vents. The positive PPE sample was unsurprising because shoe covers are not part of PPE recommendations. The risk of transmission from contaminated footwear is likely low, as evidenced by negative results in the anteroom and clean corridor.\nThis study has several limitations. First, viral culture was not done to demonstrate viability. Second, due to operational limitations during an outbreak, methodology was inconsistent and sample size was small. Third, the volume of air sampled represents only a small fraction of total volume, and air exchanges in the room would have diluted the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in the air. Further studies are required to confirm these preliminary results.\nSignificant environmental contamination by patients with SARS-CoV-2 through respiratory droplets and fecal shedding suggests the environment as a potential medium of transmission and supports the need for strict adherence to environmental and hand hygiene.\nSection Editor: Jody W.

To stem escalation of COVID-19, the World Health Organization has called for the deferral of elective surgery to divert personnel and equipment to patients with COVID-19. Thus, in the near term, surgical care is largely restricted to patients with the most severe illnesses and patients who are symptomatic and hospitalized (with any condition). Surgeons will also provide surgical and critical care for patients with COVID-19, a life-threatening virus that gives some affected individuals severe dyspnea or the need for a ventilator and thus isolates them from loved ones within days or weeks of onset. The experience in China and Italy warns other countries that the upcoming months will bring immeasurable pain to patients, families, and clinicians.\nPalliative care is a humanistic and interdisciplinary approach to care focused on prevention and relief of pain and distress in serious illness, and it is associated with improved outcomes for hospitalized patients and their families.2 Palliative care is not restricted to end-of-life care and should be delivered alongside short-term or long-term life-prolonging care. Despite evidence that palliative care improves surgical outcomes3 and the publication of recent practice guidelines for palliative care in surgery,4 surgical patients are less likely than medical patients to receive palliative care.5 However, COVID-19 presents structural, ethical, and clinical challenges forcing a fundamental reevaluation of how we care for patients. This crisis presents surgeons with an unprecedented opportunity to embrace palliative care to face this pandemic. Four key aspects of palliative care are instructive to surgeons during this crisis: (1) using serious-illness communication strategies to disclose prognosis and establish goals of care; (2) treating total pain, (3) caring for the family unit, and (4) supporting clinicians.\nUsing Serious-Illness Communication Strategies to Disclose Prognosis and Establish Goals of Care\nBecause elective surgeries have been postponed, only the patients with the highest-acuity conditions will be on surgical wards, including those who have immunosuppression and the greatest vulnerability to severe COVID-19 infection. Surgeons must hone their skills in breaking bad news, disclosing prognosis (including prognostic uncertainty), and establishing goals of care. Clinicians must have frank discussions with patients about the likelihood of death and disability after cardiopulmonary resuscitation and be vigilant that patients receive beneficial and goal-concordant treatments, especially given the high risk to health care workers and other hospitalized patients during intubation and other invasive procedures. Difficult conversations with patients and families should establish a shared understanding of the patient\u2019s clinical condition, expected clinical course with different treatment choices, and expected long-term outcomes with respect to symptoms, function, and survival. Prognostic uncertainty can be challenging for patients and all parties involved. Although little is known about the long-term outcomes after COVID-19 infection, data regarding long-term functional and cognitive outcomes after cardiopulmonary resuscitation for patients with chronic illness, older patients after intensive care, and others with chronic critical illness can be informative. Code status and health care proxy must be established on admission. Clinicians should discuss and document the patient\u2019s therapeutic goals, trade-offs they will tolerate for a desired health outcome, and preferences for life-sustaining treatment. Such conversations can facilitate directing patients toward treatments aligned with their goals. Helpful tools include the \u201cSerious Illness Conversation Guide,\u201d6 the best case/worst case communication tool,7 and VitalTalk\u2019s \u201cCOVID Ready Communication Playbook.\u201d8\nTreating Total Pain\nAssessment and treatment of physical pain is the predominant approach to pain management in surgery. However, patients with serious illness experience total pain, which also includes psychological, social, emotional, and spiritual components and will be increasingly relevant during a pandemic that causes massive shifts in how people interact with one another. For example, social distancing, school closures, remote work, self-isolation, and statewide lockdowns may cause social pain. Economic uncertainty, food hoarding, and threats of health care rationing and death panels contribute to anxiety and uncertainty about the future. High morbidity and mortality rates associated with COVID-19 lead to existential distress and worries about premature death and contributing to the death or distress of loved ones. For patients with cancer and other serious illnesses, their pain experience can be exacerbated by separation from loved ones and dehumanizing interactions with clinicians characterized by masks, face shields, and gowns.\nIgnoring multidimensional aspects of pain causes inadequate treatment and unnecessary suffering. Patients experiencing distress guided by clinicians focused on physical pain may describe generalized pain unabated by analgesics. A person-centered approach should prompt clinicians to address nonphysical and spiritual aspects of pain, including proactively engaging social workers and chaplains to support overall well-being. Helpful questions include \u201cWhat matters most to you today?\u201d and \u201cWhat do I need to know about you to do a better job taking care of you?\u201d\nCaring for the Family Unit\nPalliative care is rooted in the principle that the family, defined as persons the patient would include in their care team, is the unit of care. Because COVID-19 is highly contagious, restricted visitation from friends and family members produces untold stress for patients with serious illness who are without emotional support and families unable to see or help loved ones, as well as difficulties in keeping families informed about patient care. Patients and families should be given tools to communicate with each other and clinicians. Ensuring patients have their sensory aids (eg, glasses, hearing aids) and making tablets and computers available for family teleconferences with patients and clinicians is essential. Clinical teams should have a structured plan for daily family updates to answer questions and engage family members in care planning. For the patients with the most critical illness, family meetings should occur by teleconference shortly after intensive care unit admission and at regular intervals.\nSupporting Clinicians\nPalliative care clinicians have long recognized well-being and resilience as essential to maintaining an able workforce. This pandemic has brought on unique personal and professional challenges to clinicians who may be called to operate outside their specialty, work under adverse conditions, and care for colleagues and loved ones who are critically ill and who may harbor concern about harming their family and fear dying themselves. Institutional support is required to help surgical clinicians cope with stress, tend to personal needs, and strengthen personal relationships. The American College of Surgeons website has resources focused on surgeon well-being.9\nConclusions\nIn 2005, the American College of Surgeons called on surgeons to provide palliative care to all patients with serious illness, not just those at the end of life. Nonetheless, misperceptions about palliative care as synonymous with end-of-life care persist. There is an urgent need for surgeons to abandon biases and fully embrace palliative care to optimize care for patients, their families, and colleagues. In the past, surgeons have asked, \u201cWhich patients should receive palliative care?\u201d Today we must ask, \u201cWho should not?\u201d\nBack to top\nArticle Information\nCorresponding Author: Zara Cooper, MD, MSc, Center for Surgery and Public Health, Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital, 1620 Tremont St, Ste 2-016, Boston, MA 02120 (zcooper@bwh.harvard.edu).\nPublished Online: April 28, 2020. doi:10.1001/jamasurg.2020.1698\nConflict of Interest Disclosures: None reported.\nReferences\n1.\nJohns Hopkins University of Medicine.

In particular, this report offers opportunities to build on experience gained in managing the COVID-19 emergency in the Departments of Mental Health and Addiction (DMHAs) in Lombardy, the wealthiest Italian region, which has approximately 10 million inhabitants.\nObservations  Italy has a National Mental Health System divided into 134 DMHAs, 27 of which are in Lombardy. In the 4 weeks after the epidemic started, important changes occurred in the management of DMHAs in Lombardy. Many challenges have occurred in the management of health services. In many hospitals, entire wards, including some psychiatric wards, have been reorganized to admit patients with COVID-19, and many physicians and nurses have been diverted to wards managing patients with COVID-19. Most day facilities for patients with psychiatric needs have been temporarily closed, whereas in residential facilities, patients who usually are free to come and go during the day have had to be confined in the facilities with very limited or no leave. These changes have produced considerable stresses on people with severe mental disorders. Many outpatient clinics have limited appointments to those with the most urgent cases, and home visits, a common practice in most DMHAs, have been drastically reduced with potentially detrimental consequences for patients\u2019 well-being. Another potential detrimental consequence of being forced to stay at home has been an increase in the hours spent face to face with families with high amounts of conflict.\nConclusions and Relevance  Departments of Mental Health need to be equipped with appropriate e-health technologies and procedures to cope with situations such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, interventions are needed to mitigate the potentially harmful consequences of quarantine. Departments of Mental Health should be able to assume a leadership position in the psychosocial management of disasterlike situations, and this requires the acquisition of new skills, notably how to correctly inform the population about risk, train and disseminate effective preventive and management procedures for disasters, support health personnel and rescuers, and support those experiencing bereavement.\nIntroduction\nThe first Italian patient, a man aged 38 years, tested positive for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on February 21, 2020.1 Within a month, Italy, with a population of more than 60 million, had become the second country after China in the number of patients with COVID-19 and passed China in terms of reported deaths. By April 16, 2020, 159 107 people in Italy were known to have contracted the infection, of whom 19 996 had died.2\nOur aim is to briefly report the experience of mental health services and the lessons learned during this crisis. In particular, we will build on our experience gained in managing the COVID-19 emergency in the Departments of Mental Health (DMHAs) in Lombardy, the wealthiest Italian region, with around 10 million inhabitants, which also had the largest number of COVID-19 cases in Italy, with 63 098 confirmed cases as of April 16, 2020.2 Seven contributing authors (G.C., M.C., E.M., F. Spinogatti, F. Starace, G.T., and A.V.) lead DMHAs in the areas with the highest number of cases.\nItalian Mental Health Services\nItaly has a National Mental Health System divided into 134 DMHAs, 27 of which are in Lombardy. In 2017, the DMHAs provided care for 851 189 Italians.3 Mental health care is available to all, and most of the cost is covered by the National Mental Health System budget. In Italy, nearly 2400 residential facilities (RFs) with a mean of 13 beds have completely replaced former mental hospitals for long-term care, and they house 26 310 patients requiring long-term care. There are also 318 general hospital psychiatric wards (GHPWs) of similar size, with a total of 3981 beds, and there are also 22 accredited private hospitals, with a total of 1155 beds, covered by the National Mental Health System. This gives a total of around 10 acute beds per 100\u202f000 adult population, as well as many day facilities, which are generally attached to community mental health centers.\nCOVID-19 and Management of Mental Health Services in Lombardy\nIn the 4 weeks after the epidemic started, important changes occurred in the management of DMHAs in Lombardy. In most hospitals, entire wards, including some GHPWs, have been reorganized to admit patients with COVID-19. In scenes reminiscent of a wartime emergency, many physicians and nurses, including in some cases those working in GHPWs, have been diverted to wards managing patients with COVID-19. Some managers of GHPWs have resisted change out of concern for the psychiatric care of their patients. Patients with psychiatric needs are also among those infected by the virus, and the need to adopt safe practices and isolate patients hospitalized in psychiatric wards in single rooms for 2 weeks if they contracted COVID-19 has proved particularly difficult.\nHowever, the main organizational challenges have occurred in day facilities and RFs. Most day facilities have been temporarily closed, whereas in RFs, patients who had been free to come and go during the day have had to be confined in the facilities with very limited or no leave. These changes have produced considerable stresses on people with disabling mental illness. Many patients who were used to spending several hours a day in a day center have been forced to stay at home for days with few opportunities for interpersonal contact, while residents of RFs were suddenly forced to experience confinement more typical of an acute psychiatric ward. Other changes have affected many outpatient clinics, with national and regional rules limiting appointments to patients with the most urgent cases. Home visits, a common practice in most DMHAs, have been drastically reduced, with potentially detrimental consequences for patients\u2019 well-being. Another potential detrimental consequence of being forced to stay at home has been an increase in the number of hours spent in face-to-face contact with relatives, in families with high levels of expressed emotion. Similar developments may be expected in other countries with predominantly community-based mental health services if the course of the pandemic in those countries follows the experience of Italy.\nInfections and Deaths Among Health Personnel\nThe COVID-19 epidemic has affected many health personnel in Italy: as of April 16, 2020, 16 991 health personnel have been infected, and 127 physicians caring for patients with COVID-19 have died.2 The number of health staff infected is twice as high as in China.4 The reasons for this very high proportion of health personnel infected are unclear and will need a proper, accurate investigation. Generally speaking, many personnel have been highly distressed by this unforeseen and complex situation, which has also been reported in a recent survey in China.4\nBehavioral Changes in the Public\nThe sudden, massive restrictions caused by the epidemic have resulted in changes in the behavior of every resident that a month ago might have been considered the stuff of fiction. On the whole, Italians have rapidly adapted to the emergency measures, and compliance with restrictions to personal freedom and recommended changes in habits and schedules has been high (certainly higher than expected). According to official data,5 in the 10 days after the initiation of restrictions on March 11, 2020, there were 1 650 644 police assessments of people walking or driving, with 95.7% found to be compliant by showing there were compelling reasons to leave their homes. We do not know whether the rate of violations among people with mental disorders in treatment has been higher or lower, which will be an area worth exploring in the near future; there are no similar data available from other countries in lockdown for a comparison of compliance with restrictive measures.\nPopulations at Risk\nAn unforeseen, disastrous consequence of the COVID-19 epidemic has been violent, destructive riots in 20 Italian jails involving as many as 6000 prisoners and resulting in the deaths of 12 prisoners (by overdose with drugs stolen from prison pharmacies) and injuries to 40 officers.6 The management of epidemics in high-security settings, such as prisons and detention centers, in which isolation of the affected population and adoption of other infection control measures require careful planning and are not easy to implement, will need special reflections, especially if many of those infected are security and health staff.\nAddiction services are also affected, and in many areas, patients in methadone treatment have been given more than 1 dose at a time because of restrictions of movement, which may increase the risk of overdoses. We do not know the outcome of the restrictions on rates and patterns of substance use. Health care workers treating children and adolescents with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder or intellectual disabilities also report increasing problems among parents forced to manage these young individuals at home for extended periods, and the extent of any change in the rate of family violence has yet to be assessed.\nSadly, there is likely to be a new area of clinical activity: providing services for those bereaved because of COVID-19. As things stand, the isolation measures have meant that the relatives of many patients who have died have not been able to visit their deceased relatives during hospitalization or organize funerals because of the strong restriction on public gatherings of any kind.\nLessons for the Future\nWhat are the main lessons for mental health services that can be learned from this unforeseen situation? The first lesson is that DMHAs need to be equipped with appropriate e-health technologies and procedures to cope with situations such as this one. For instance, DMHAs need to be able to manage online consultations, either by videolink or messaging service, for patients who are used to face-to-face consultations. Those online consultations will need to include arrangements for changes to medications, communication with people supporting patients living alone at home and those suddenly exposed to marked isolation, and counseling for patients living in households with high levels of conflict. The same applies to support to families who have children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder or intellectual disabilities. Means for e-mental health have been rapidly made available by DMHAs in some areas, but preparations need to be made for e\u2013mental health to be implemented everywhere.\nConnected to this, there needs to be a rollout of interventions to mitigate the potentially harmful consequences of quarantine.7 This is an area where self-help groups may play a pivotal role. It will be worth investigating whether in the next months we will record an increase in new contacts with DMHAs.\nAnother lesson is that DMHAs should be able to assume a leadership position in the psychosocial management of disasterlike situations; in Italy, very few if any DMHAs are equipped in terms of skills, knowledge, and training to intervene in natural or other disasters. This requires the acquisition of new skills. First is how to correctly inform the population about risk. While a shortage of information can be detrimental, we have faced an information overload about the epidemic and the consequences of this must be evaluated, even in terms of secondary traumatization and increase in posttraumatic stress disorder and stress reactions. Information overload has been characterized by contradictory information from national, regional, and local authorities; scientists with different backgrounds; and mass media, which presumably leads many people to fear the worst. Second, it is important to acquire skills in training and disseminating effective preventive and management procedures for disasters, including discouraging use of procedures of established ineffectiveness (eg, debriefing survivors of a disaster,8,9 which is often described as helpful in the media in Italy). Third, skills in supporting health personnel and rescuers, who are often highly distressed, is important. In some areas, DMHAs have done this, but again, effective strategies should be selected and disseminated. Finally, it is important to gain skills in supporting those who are bereaved.\nAdditionally, DMHAs should prepare plans for rapid reorganizations of inpatient stays and daily schedules in RFs in emergencies. Patients in these centers may be particularly distressed at the sudden introduction of restrictive measures.\nResearch Priorities\nAlthough past epidemics, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome, Ebola virus disease, and Middle East respiratory syndrome, should have given us some understanding of how to respond, the speed and scale of this pandemic has taken the world by surprise, with differing responses in different countries adding to a sense of uncertainty and stress. Being able to measure respondents\u2019 stress levels and psychosocial adjustment is essential to both plan for the necessary psychosocial support during the recovery phase and prepare ourselves should this happen again. Therefore, learning from research findings will be essential.\nIt is possible to identify 7 population subgroups affected by the psychosocial consequences of the COVID-19 epidemic: (1) the general population affected by restrictive measures, (2) people subjected to quarantine because of contact with an individual with an infection, who themselves were not positive, (3) people positive for the virus who did not need hospital treatment and were isolated at home, (4) people positive for COVID-19 who were hospitalized and have recovered, (5) health care personnel coordinating or providing care during the pandemic, (6) relatives of persons who died, and (7) patients in treatment for mental disorders. It is important to understand the immediate and long-term outcome of COVID-19 pandemic in these 7 different groups, including stigma for those infected, to tailor support services to meet their unique needs. If we will do this, future emergencies will find us better prepared to cope.\nBack to top\nArticle Information\nAcceptance Date: April 1, 2020.\nCorresponding Author: Giovanni de Girolamo, MD, IRCCS Istituto Centro San Giovanni di Dio Fatebenefratelli, Via Pilastroni, 4, 25125 Brescia, Italy (gdegirolamo@fatebenefratelli.eu).\nPublished Online: April 30, 2020. doi:10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2020.1276\nAuthor Contributions: Drs Girolamo and Clerici had full access to all of the data in the study and take responsibility for the integrity of the data and the accuracy of the data analysis.\nConcept and design: All authors.\nAcquisition, analysis, or interpretation of data: de Girolamo, Clerici, Starace, Tura.\nDrafting of the manuscript: de Girolamo, Cerveri, Clerici, Spinogatti, Starace, Tura.\nCritical revision of the manuscript for important intellectual content: Cerveri, Clerici, Monzani, Tura, Vita.\nStatistical analysis: Tura.\nObtained funding: Tura.\nAdministrative, technical, or material support: de Girolamo, Starace, Tura.\nSupervision: de Girolamo, Clerici, Tura, Vita.\nConflict of Interest Disclosures: None reported.\nAdditional Contributions: Matthew Large, MBBS, DMedSci, School of Psychiatry, University of New South Wales, and Prince of Wales Hospital Sydney, and Olav Nielssen, MBBS, MCrim, PhD, Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, Macquarie University, St Vincents Mental Health, provided valuable comments on the manuscript, uncompensated.\nReferences\n1.\nTask force COVID-19 del Dipartimento Malattie Infettive e Servizio di Informatica, Istituto Superiore di Sanit\u00e0.

A positive COVID-19 test result was observed in 1735 (9.4%) tested patients, and among all patients with positive test results, 116 (6.7%) were taking ACEIs, and 98 (5.6%) were taking ARBs; there was no association between ACEI/ARB use and testing positive for COVID-19 (overlap propensity score\u2013weighted odds ratio, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.81-1.15).\nMeaning  These data support various society guidelines to continue current treatment of chronic disease conditions with either ACEI or ARB during the COVID-19 pandemic.\nAbstract\nImportance  The role of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB) in the setting of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is hotly debated. There have been recommendations to discontinue these medications, which are essential in the treatment of several chronic disease conditions, while, in the absence of clinical evidence, professional societies have advocated their continued use.\nObjective  To study the association between use of ACEIs/ARBs with the likelihood of testing positive for COVID-19 and to study outcome data in subsets of patients taking ACEIs/ARBs who tested positive with severity of clinical outcomes of COVID-19 (eg, hospitalization, intensive care unit admission, and requirement for mechanical ventilation).\nDesign, Setting, and Participants  Retrospective cohort study with overlap propensity score weighting was conducted at the Cleveland Clinic Health System in Ohio and Florida. All patients tested for COVID-19 between March 8 and April 12, 2020, were included.\nExposures  History of taking ACEIs or ARBs at the time of COVID-19 testing.\nMain Outcomes and Measures  Results of COVID-19 testing in the entire cohort, number of patients requiring hospitalizations, intensive care unit admissions, and mechanical ventilation among those who tested positive.\nResults  A total of 18\u202f472 patients tested for COVID-19. The mean (SD) age was 49\u2009(21) years, 7384 (40%) were male, and 12\u202f725 (69%) were white. Of 18\u202f472 patients who underwent COVID-19 testing, 2285 (12.4%) were taking either ACEIs or ARBs. A positive COVID-19 test result was observed in 1735 of 18\u202f472 patients (9.4%). Among patients who tested positive, 421 (24.3%) were admitted to the hospital, 161 (9.3%) were admitted to an intensive care unit, and 111 (6.4%) required mechanical ventilation. Overlap propensity score weighting showed no significant association of ACEI and/or ARB use with COVID-19 test positivity (overlap propensity score\u2013weighted odds ratio, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.81-1.15).\nConclusions and Relevance  This study found no association between ACEI or ARB use and COVID-19 test positivity. These clinical data support current professional society guidelines to not discontinue ACEIs or ARBs in the setting of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, further study in larger numbers of hospitalized patients receiving ACEI and ARB therapy is needed to determine the association with clinical measures of COVID-19 severity.\nIntroduction\nCoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has developed into a pandemic since it was first identified in Wuhan, China.1 At the time of this writing, there have been approximately 2 million cases reported and more than 120\u202f000 deaths (6%) due to COVID-19 across 211 countries worldwide.2 SARS-CoV-2 binds to the extracellular domain of the transmembrane angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor to gain entry into host cells.3 While angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB) have been shown to upregulate ACE2 expression in some animal models,4,5 there are a limited number of human studies showing mixed results on plasma ACE2 levels, and there are none on their effect on lung-specific expression of ACE2, to our knowledge.6 Patients with hypertension, diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases (among other underlying disease conditions that are often treated with these agents) have been reported to have the highest case fatality rates.7 These observations have led to concerns that patients who are taking these medications are at an increased risk for becoming infected with SARS-CoV-2 and may have worse outcomes.8,9 However, it has also been postulated that upregulation of ACE2 may improve outcomes in infection-induced acute lung injury in patients with SARS-CoV or SARS-CoV-2 infections.10,11 Moreover, in the setting of SARS-CoV-2 infection, in certain high-risk patients, the withdrawal of ACEIs or ARBs may be harmful.6 Several professional societies, in the absence of sufficient clinical evidence, have recommended continued use of these medications.12\nWe sought to clarify the potential association of ACEI and/or ARB use with the likelihood of having a positive SARS-CoV-2 test to help assess whether use of these drugs is associated with an increase in likelihood of viral infectivity, an effect that might occur with upregulation of ACE2. As the downstream pathways of ACE2 are cell protective and viral binding to ACE2 may downregulate ACE2 expression, we also aimed to determine whether ACEI or ARB use was associated with differences in clinical outcomes.\nMethods\nStudy Design and Oversight\nA retrospective cohort analysis of a prospective, observational, institutional review board\u2013approved registry of all patients tested for COVID-19 within the Cleveland Clinic Health System in Ohio and Florida was performed. Data were extracted via previously validated automated feeds13 from electronic health records (EPIC; EPIC Systems Corporation) and manually by a study team trained on uniform sources for the study variables. Study data were collected and managed using REDCap14,15 electronic data capture tools hosted at the Cleveland Clinic. Baseline characteristics, comorbidities, medications, test results, and clinical outcomes of all patients were extracted from the registry. The exposures of interest were ACEI or ARB use as recorded in the medication list in the electronic medical records at the time of testing for SARS-CoV-2. Owing to the potentially differential effects of the 2 medication classes on ACE2 expression, exposures to ACEIs and ARBs were evaluated in separate and pooled analyses.\nA waiver of informed consent (oral or written) from study participants in the COVID-19 registry was granted by the Cleveland Clinic Health System institutional review board. This cohort study is reported in accordance with the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) reporting guideline.16\nStudy Population\nThe cohort included all patients tested for COVID-19 from March 8, 2020, to April 12, 2020. The testing protocol was modified during the course of the study owing to increasing demand and limitations of testing capabilities. Prior to March 18, the criteria for testing were less stringent (recent travel to a high-risk area, symptoms of respiratory illness, physician discretion, or a history of contact with a patient with COVID-19). Starting March 18, owing to a high demand for tests, a decision was made to prioritize testing for patients who had 2 of 3 qualifying symptoms: cough, difficulty breathing, fever (temperature >38\u2009\u00b0C), and at least 1 of the following criteria: older than 60 years or younger than 36 months, receiving immunosuppressive therapy, cancer, end-stage kidney disease and receiving dialysis, diabetes, hypertension, coronary artery disease, heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, lung disease, contact with an individual with COVID-19, HIV/AIDS, or solid organ transplants. After March 21, diarrhea was added to the 3 qualifying symptoms.\nTesting was also available during the entire time to health care workers with temperature of more than 38\u2009\u00b0C and/or acute respiratory symptoms (cough, shortness of breath), and/or diarrhea and those admitted to the emergency department or the hospital.\nGiven previous beliefs that coinfection of SARS-CoV-2 with other respiratory viruses is rare, a reflex-testing algorithm was implemented to conserve resources. All patient specimens were first tested for the presence of influenza A/B and respiratory syncytial virus, and only those negative for influenza and respiratory syncytial virus were subsequently tested for SARS-CoV-2. Forty patients were admitted to the hospital more than once, and this analysis only includes their most severe hospital admission according to intensive care unit (ICU) status and need for mechanical ventilation.\nLaboratory Confirmation\nNasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swab specimens were collected and pooled for testing by trained medical personnel. Infection with SARS-CoV-2 was confirmed by laboratory testing using the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reverse transcription\u2013polymerase chain reaction SARS-CoV-2 assay that was validated in the Cleveland Clinic Robert J. Tomsich Pathology and Laboratory Medicine Institute. This assay used an extraction kit (MagNA Pure; Roche) and 7500 Dx Real-Time PCR System instruments (Applied Biosystems). Between March 8 and 13, 2020, the tests were sent out to LabCorp in Burlington, North Carolina. All testing was authorized by the Food and Drug Administration under an Emergency Use Authorization and in accordance with the guidelines established by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\nStudy Outcomes\nThe primary outcome was a positive laboratory test result for COVID-19. We also performed a secondary analysis of the clinical outcomes of COVID-19 among patients with positive test results and included hospital admission, admission to the ICU, and mechanical ventilation during index hospitalization.\nStatistical Analysis\nAll descriptive statistics were reported as counts (percentages) or means\u2009(SDs). For comparison of demographic variables and comorbidities among cohorts, independent-sample t tests were used for numeric variables, while \u03c72 or Fisher exact tests were used for categorical variables.\nGiven that patients prescribed ACEIs or ARBs are more likely to have underlying comorbidities, overlap propensity score weighting was performed to address potential confounding. A propensity score for taking ACEIs (ARBs) was estimated from a multivariable logistic regression model containing patient age, sex, and presence of hypertension, diabetes, coronary artery disease, heart failure, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Propensity score distributions according to ACEI and ARB usage are shown in the eFigure in the Supplement. The overlap propensity score weighting method was then applied, in which each patient\u2019s weight is the probability of that patient being assigned to the opposite medication group.17 Overlap propensity score\u2013weighted logistic regression models investigated associations between medication status and the probability of testing positive for COVID-19, as well as other clinical outcomes. As a separate analysis, patients taking either ACEIs or ARBs were combined into 1 group and compared with patients not taking either of the 2 medications. Body mass index values were missing for approximately one-third of the patients; these data are only reported descriptively in Table 1 but were not included in overlap propensity score weighting.\nAll statistical analyses were performed using SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute). P values were 2-sided, with a significance threshold of .05. Data analysis began April 2020.\nResults\nThe data set consisted of 18\u202f472 patients tested for SARS-CoV-2. The mean (SD) age was 49\u2009(21) years, 7384 (40%) were male, and 12\u202f725 (69%) were white. A positive COVID-19 result was observed in 1735 tested patients (9.4%). Among patients with positive test results, 421 (24.3%) were admitted to the hospital, 161 (9.3%) were admitted to an ICU, and 111 (6.4%) required mechanical ventilation. The cohort had a substantial prevalence of comorbidities: hypertension (7312 [40%]), diabetes (3478 [19%]), coronary artery disease (2179 [12%]), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (2186 [12%]), and heart failure (1879 [10%]).\nSARS-CoV-2 Test Positivity and ACEI and/or ARB Use\nAmong all tested patients, 1322 (7.2%) were taking ACEIs and 982 (5.3%) were taking ARBs. Among all patients with positive SARS-CoV-2 test results, 116 (6.7%) were taking ACEIs and 98 (5.6%) were taking ARBs. Patients taking either ACEIs or ARBs had more comorbidities than those not taking these medications (Table 1).\nAfter overlap propensity score weighting for both ACEIs and ARBs, the test positivity rate was 8.6% in patients taking ACEIs compared with 9.5% in patients not taking ACEIs (overlap propensity score\u2013weighted odds ratio [OR], 0.89; 95% CI, 0.72-1.10). Test positivity rate was 10.0% in patients taking ARBs compared with 9.3% in patients not taking ARBs (overlap propensity score\u2013weighted OR, 1.09; 95% CI, 0.87-1.37) (Figure and Table 2).\nClinical Outcomes in Patients With Positive SARS-CoV-2 Results\nAmong patients with positive test results and overlap propensity score weighing, 54% taking ACEIs (vs 39% not taking ACEIs) were admitted to the hospital (OR,\u20091.84; 95% CI,\u20091.22-2.79); 24% taking ACEIs (vs 15% not taking ACEIs) were admitted to an ICU (OR,\u20091.77; 95% CI,\u20091.07-2.92); and 14% taking ACEIs (vs 11% not taking ACEIs) required mechanical ventilation (OR,\u20091.35; 95% CI,\u20090.74-2.47). Similarly, among patients with positive test results and overlap propensity score weighting, 53% taking ARBs (vs 41% not taking ARBs) were admitted to the hospital (OR,\u20091.61; 95% CI,\u20091.04-2.50); 20% taking ARBs (vs 18% not taking ARBs) were admitted to an ICU (OR,\u20091.16; 95% CI,\u20090.67-2.02); and 14% taking ARBs (vs 12% not taking ARBs) required mechanical ventilation (OR,\u20091.12; 95% CI,\u20090.59-2.12) (Table 3). When patients taking either ACEI or ARBs were combined into 1 group and overlap propensity score\u2013weighted to patients not taking either of the 2 medications, the results were similar (Figure, Table 2, and Table 3).\nDeaths\nAmong 1705 patients with SARS-CoV-2 with death status available, 42 deaths (2.5%) occurred. Eight of 211 patients (3.8%) were in the ACEI or ARB cohort and 34 of 1494 (2.1%) were in the no-ACEI or no-ARB cohort.\nDiscussion\nIn this cohort of 18\u202f472 patients who underwent COVID-19 testing, 2285 (12.4%) were taking ACEIs or ARBs. Taking either an ACEI or ARB was not associated with an increase in the likelihood of testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection (Figure). Although unadjusted analyses suggested that taking either ACEIs or ARBs was associated with worse clinical outcomes as defined by requiring hospital admission, admission to the ICU, or requiring mechanical ventilation, it should be noted that these medications are often used in the treatment of patients with underlying chronic disease conditions. Thus, we used overlap propensity score weighting to adjust for underlying confounding factors. Overlap propensity score\u2013weighted analysis showed a higher likelihood of hospital admission among patients with positive test results who were taking either ACEIs or ARBs. There was a higher likelihood of ICU admission among patients with positive test results who were taking ACEIs, but no such difference was observed among those taking ARBs. There was no difference in either groups with regard to requirement of mechanical ventilation during index hospitalization (Table 3). However, data with regard to clinical outcomes and measures of COVID-19 severity taking ACEIs and ARBs must be interpreted with caution and be considered only hypothesis generating, owing in part to the small sample size and the wide width of the confidence intervals in addition to the limitations of the study discussed below.\nThe current debate about ACEIs/ARBs and SARS-CoV-2 is based on the concern that these agents may upregulate ACE2 expression. Because SARS-CoV-2 enters into the respiratory epithelial cell by binding its viral spike protein to the extracellular domain of the structural transmembrane ACE2 receptor, these agents could potentially increase the risk of infection and worse outcomes. However, ACE2 converts angiotensin II, which promotes vasoconstriction, inflammation, and fibrosis, into angiotensin-(1-7), which may potentially protect the lung from acute injury. At present, there is no convincing evidence that ACEIs/ARBs have effects on the transmembrane ACE2 receptor in humans that would predispose to COVID-19 infection.6\nWhile the effect of ACEI/ARBs on SARS-CoV-2 infection at the molecular level is being debated, the limited amount of clinical evidence available has added to the controversy. In a retrospective study of 187 patients with COVID-19, prior use of ACEIs or ARBs (in 19 patients) was associated with elevated troponin levels, which was indirectly associated with worse clinical outcomes.18 However, in a study of elderly patients with hypertension with COVID-19, those taking ARBs (10 patients) had better outcomes compared with those who were taking other antihypertensive agents.19\nIn animals, ACEIs and ARBs have different effects on cardiac membrane ACE2 activity.5 It would be of interest to analyze for differences in clinical outcomes among patients taking ACEIs and ARBs in future studies with larger data sets.\nLimitations\nWith any observational study, there is a risk of confounding factors. To attempt to overcome this limitation, we performed an overlap propensity score\u2013weighted analysis. Despite the robust initial sample size, there were few events in the ACEI or ARB users. As these data reflect test results early in the course of the pandemic, it will be of interest to repeat these analyses with larger data sets and later in the course of the pandemic. The data analyzed included information about patients receiving either ACEIs or ARBs at the time of testing but did not include information on duration of ACEI or ARB use before or after testing. Thus, we could not address the effect of duration of use of these agents or withdrawal effects after infection, eg, at the time of hospitalization. The data reflected the medication list in the electronic medical record, which may have inaccuracies owing to nonadherence to medications in the ACEI or ARB groups and nonascertainment bias from patients in the control group taking ACEIs or ARBs that was not recorded. In our secondary analyses, hospital admission was likely based on more subjective criteria than ICU admission or mechanical ventilation. There may have been a lower threshold to admit patients taking either ACEIs or ARBs or with the underlying disease conditions associated with these medications. The majority of the study population was white, which limits the generalizability of the results because there are reports of differences in expression of ACE2 among various races/ethnicities.20 This should be considered before extrapolating the results to other ethnic groups. It is possible that some patients who tested positive may have been subsequently admitted to a hospital outside our health care system and thus were lost to follow-up. One can reasonably expect that these patients would not introduce a bias in the study because taking ACEIs/ARBs would not influence where a person is admitted.\nConclusions\nIn this study of the associations of ACEI and ARB use with COVID-19 test positivity, the frequency of positive test results was not significantly different in patients taking either ACEIs or ARBs at the time of testing. ACEIs and ARBs are important medications in the management of coronary artery disease, heart failure, diabetes, and hypertension. As there may be a risk to withdrawing these agents, our study, showing no significant greater susceptibility with regard to test positivity, supports the recommendations of several professional societies12 that have recommended continuation of these medications. Results of the secondary analyses of association of ACEI or ARB use and markers of clinical disease severity, including hospital admission, ICU admission, or mechanical ventilation requirement, require replication and reanalysis in larger numbers of patients later in the course of the current COVID-19 pandemic.\nBack to top\nArticle Information\nCorresponding Author: Ankur Kalra, MD, Department of Cardiovascular Medicine, Heart, Vascular and Thoracic Institute, Cleveland Clinic, 224 West Exchange St, Ste 225, Akron, OH 44302 (kalraa@ccf.org).\nAccepted for Publication: April 18, 2020.\nPublished Online: May 5, 2020. doi:10.1001/jamacardio.2020.1855\nAuthor Contributions: Drs Mehta and Kalra had full access to all of the data in the study and take responsibility for the integrity of the data and the accuracy of the data analysis.\nConcept and design: Mehta, Kalra, Nowacki, Bhat, Carmona-Rubio, Jacob, Milinovich, Svensson, Young, Chung.\nAcquisition, analysis, or interpretation of data: Mehta, Kalra, Nowacki, Anjewierden, Han, Bhat, Carmona-Rubio, Procop, Harrington, Milinovich, Jehi, Chung.\nDrafting of the manuscript: Mehta, Kalra, Nowacki, Anjewierden, Han, Bhat, Carmona-Rubio, Procop, Milinovich, Chung.\nCritical revision of the manuscript for important intellectual content: Mehta, Kalra, Nowacki, Anjewierden, Han, Bhat, Carmona-Rubio, Jacob, Harrington, Milinovich, Svensson, Jehi, Young, Chung.\nStatistical analysis: Mehta, Kalra, Nowacki, Anjewierden, Han, Milinovich.\nObtained funding: Jehi, Young.\nAdministrative, technical, or material support: Mehta, Bhat, Procop, Harrington, Milinovich, Jehi, Young.\nSupervision: Kalra, Svensson, Young, Chung.\nConflict of Interest Disclosures: Dr Milinovich reports royalties for use of REDCap from nPhase during the conduct of the study and grants from Novo Nordisk, Boehringer Ingelheim, Merck, Novartis, Otsuka, and the National Institutes of Health outside the submitted work.

Nowhere has this been more evident than in health care. Health care delivery systems in some locations have been overwhelmed, and even those not so severely affected have had to reorganize and restructure to concentrate resources to meet an anticipated surge of patients who are critically ill. In the absence of rapid and reliable testing, proven therapies, or even standard protocols for treatment, physicians and other clinicians have been forced to improvise, in some cases relying on the thinnest of evidence, to treat patients who are desperately ill.\nThe response of the medical research community has been remarkable. Investigators have rapidly pivoted to fill the enormous gap in knowledge the pandemic has laid bare. While nearly all medical research not directly related to COVID-19 or otherwise deemed essential has been paused, laboratories around the world have refocused on elucidating the biological characteristics of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 in support of efforts to develop treatments and vaccines. In addition to the phenomenal investment in basic research, clinical investigators have collected massive amounts of data and launched nearly 1000 clinical trials worldwide.1\nIn this study by Borba et al,2 results are presented from a preliminary study that tested a compound, chloroquine sulfate, that has been widely touted in the lay press as an effective treatment for COVID-19. Hydroxychloroquine, which was initially used widely as an antimalarial drug, has also long been used as an effective treatment of chronic rheumatic diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus. In addition, earlier research on this drug suggested that it had potential antiviral properties. In 2 small, uncontrolled studies, hydroxychloroquine and its congener, chloroquine, were reported to be effective against COVID-19, although the publishing journal\u2019s society subsequently declared that the trial did \u201cnot meet the Society\u2019s expected standard.\u201d3-5 These weak findings, bolstered by anecdotal reports and media attention, have fostered widespread belief in the efficacy of these agents. In response, concerns have been raised about the lack of reliable efficacy data and about potential toxic effects. In short-term use, chloroquine can prolong the QT interval and induce arrhythmias. This is especially concerning in elderly patients with underlying heart disease who are at highest risk for COVID-19. Nonetheless, in many hospitals, patients with known or suspected COVID-19 infection are routinely being treated with chloroquine, and it is often being coadministered with other agents, such as azithromycin, that might synergistically cause QT interval prolongation.6 At least 1 death in the general population has resulted from unintentional poisoning due to ill-advised use of chloroquine.7\nBorba and colleagues2 performed a parallel, double-blind, randomized clinical trial in a Brazilian population designed to assess the safety of chloroquine in dosages that, based on earlier research, were thought to be sufficient to exert antiviral effects.2 They compared a high dose of chloroquine, 600 mg twice daily for 10 days (total dosage, 12.0 g), with a lower-dose regimen, initially 450 mg twice daily on the first day, tapering to 450 mg once daily for 4 days (total dosage, 2.7 g). Patients enrolled in the trial exhibited fever and respiratory symptoms, along with tachypnea, tachycardia, hypoxemia, or hypotension. The primary outcome was death, originally planned to be assessed at 28 days after entry to the trial. Secondary outcomes included death at 13 days, electrocardiographic anomalies, recovery of viral RNA, and a number of clinical events, such as duration of mechanical ventilation and clinical status. Because of delays in testing for the virus, treatment was initiated based on suspicion of COVID-19. Ultimately, 31 of 40 patients (77.5%) in the low-dose group and 31 of 41 patients (75.6%) in the high-dose group had test results positive for COVID-19. This should not be viewed as a problem, as it accurately reflects the conditions under which many patients are being treated in the absence of a definitive diagnosis.\nThe intended sample size was 440 individuals, but based on occurrence of serious adverse events, the data safety monitoring board terminated the trial after only 81 individuals had been enrolled, preceding even the first planned interim analysis at 25% of enrollment. By day 13 of enrollment, 6 of 40 patients (15.0%) in the low-dose group had died, compared with 16 of 41 patients (39.0%) in the high-dose group. Prolongation of QTc interval was observed in 4 of 36 patients (11.1%) in the low-dose group and 7 of 37 patients (18.9%) in the high-dose group. In addition, 2 patients in the high-dose group (2.7%) experienced ventricular tachycardia. Three of 5 patients (60.0%) in the high-dose group with underlying heart disease died.\nDespite these discouraging findings, several other observations prevent concluding categorically that high-dose chloroquine was toxic and that the likely mechanism was arrhythmogenesis. First, Borba et al2 found no apparent association of the appearance of QTc interval prolongation and subsequent death. There was also no witnessed torsade de pointes, an arrhythmia that is characteristically induced by QTc interval prolongation. Second, all patients were also receiving azithromycin, and nearly all were receiving oseltamivir (for possible influenza), which can also prolong the QTc interval. Thus, one can only conclude from this trial that high-dose chloroquine (and by close association, hydroxychloroquine) in combination and azithromycin and possibly oseltamivir, is potentially associated with increased mortality among patients with severe, suspected COVID-19.\nSeveral other trials, including a large multicenter trial in the US, are ongoing and hopefully will provide additional crucial information about the efficacy and safety of hydroxychloroquine. In the interim, the results of this trial by Borba et al2 should prompt some degree of skepticism toward the enthusiastic claims about chloroquine and perhaps serve to curb the exuberant use. For the time being, prudent clinicians should discuss with patients and their families, when feasible, the potential risks of this drug and the uncertain benefits before initiating it.\nThis trial by Borba et al2 also illustrates some of the successes and challenges that the COVID-19 pandemic has created for publication of research results. The mechanisms to design, approve, fund, and execute important research have dramatically accelerated. The first patient was enrolled in this trial on March 26, 2020, and the first submission of this manuscript to the JAMA Network was on April 13, 2020. The rapidity with which clinical data have been issuing forth through traditional medical journals and other conduits is unsurpassed. Journals, including JAMA Network Open, have been receiving hundreds of submissions from around the globe. In response to the urgency of disseminating information, JAMA Network Open has adapted processes to expedite triage, review, and publication of important studies while still maintaining high-quality peer review. This is all the more difficult in the present environment, when the most qualified reviewers are busily engaged in dealing with the epidemic in their own institutions and their larger communities. Nevertheless, it remains critically important that a commitment not only to high-quality science, but also to accurate and unbiased reporting, remains intact as we seek to publish results as rapidly as possible. Science poorly conducted or poorly reported is counter to the public interest.\nIn the current torrent of data, the half-life of information is short. A novel observation from a week earlier rapidly becomes common knowledge or is superseded by more definitive studies. That so much research is being conducted and published underscores the robustness of the scientific publishing enterprise and should be heartening to the world population as we all wait anxiously for information and signs of progress.\nBack to top\nArticle Information\nOpen Access: This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the CC-BY License. \u00a9 2020 Fihn SD et al.

Social distancing and quarantine have cut off access to routine medical care for numerous individuals with neurological diseases. Many are at increased risk when coinfected with COVID-19 because of their advanced age (eg, those with Alzheimer disease), comorbid conditions (eg, those with respiratory impairment in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis), or immunosuppressive treatments (eg, those with multiple sclerosis). The current COVID-19 crisis is catalyzing the use of telemedicine and remote home monitoring to ascertain a continuation of care for these vulnerable populations.\nTo mitigate the risk of becoming infected, patients with neurological conditions should avoid traditional outpatient visits if possible, especially in crowded hospitals. There are unavoidable situations for hospital visits, such as a need for thrombolysis in acute stroke. There are also less critical indications that require physical contact, such as continued chemotherapy infusions or (less urgently) botulinum toxin treatment for dystonia or headache. Elective in-house treatments have been postponed, sometimes leading to extended disability (eg, delayed surgery for painful radiculopathies) and precipitating anxiety (eg, evaluation of new-onset seizures).\nThe silver lining of this crisis is that it accelerates delivery of remote care for those with chronic neurological conditions. Awareness has grown that chronic neurological care may be best delivered as close to the patient\u2019s home as possible for several reasons. First, relevant disease complications, such as falls or seizures, occur only sporadically; asking about such rare events is notoriously unreliable, particularly in patients with cognitive decline. Second, treatment responses can be challenging to capture during episodic outpatient visits, particularly when treatment outcomes fluctuate over time. Third, observations in clinical settings often provide an unrealistic perspective of the patient\u2019s actual functioning, as with patients with Parkinson disease who can move well when observed by clinicians despite having debilitating freezing of gait at home. Fourth, home visits provide new insights into a patient\u2019s natural environment. Fifth, home-based consultations offer greater confidentiality (and this is useful because visits to psychiatry clinics can be associated with stigma). Finally, outpatient visits are inefficient and often unsafe. Individuals may require long travels to hospitals, which in thinly populated areas can take hours. Following long commutes, they sit in crowded waiting rooms, only to see a clinician for 10 to 15 minutes. Consider also that driving a car is unsafe for many patients with neurological conditions, while entering and exiting the car can cause falls and fractures. Others have referred to these considerations as the 4 C\u2019s: better access to care, greater convenience, enhanced patient comfort, and better confidentiality.1 We now propose that the COVID-19 crisis is adding a fifth C, namely that of contagion.\nThese insights have motivated researchers to evaluate the merits of telemedicine approaches, including videoconferencing for remote consultations. The evidence to support the feasibility and effectiveness of such remote care delivery has grown steadily. For example, remote care by a neurologist via videoconferencing was associated with outcomes comparable with regular outpatient visits, but with much greater efficiency.1 Others showed that telemedicine can be used to deliver home-based interventions, such as activity-based training for survivors of stroke, which was as effective when delivered via telemedicine as through in-clinic programs.2\nOther forms of telemedicine include remote monitoring using sensors,3 which can be attached to the patient, activated on their watch or telephone, incorporated into their clothes, or embedded in their home environment. Specific symptoms, such as tremor, gait, and falls, appear very measurable. Monitoring can be passive (occurring in the background) or active, such as asking patients to complete scheduled tasks at fixed intervals. A successful example of passive monitoring was provided for patients with Parkinson disease, showing that body-worn sensors could reliably monitor falls in the home environment.4 Finally, e-diaries can remotely screen for development or progression of nonmotor symptoms, such as pain or constipation. Paroxysmal events (eg, migraine, seizures) can also be monitored remotely using e-diaries.5,6 These examples collectively illustrate how neurological diseases have emerged as good candidates for telemedicine approaches, although other fields of medicine noted similar benefits.7 Importantly, these remote monitoring options, by offering reliable insights into issues that matter most to patients, will empower clinicians in delivering tailormade counseling to patients via videoconferencing, because such counseling remains the largest component of the neurology services that we offer.\nIt is counterintuitive that this persuasive evidence has not yet led to widespread adoption in everyday neurology care. It is a common truism that health care is particularly resilient to change; the expression \u201ceverybody wants to innovate, but nobody likes to change\u201d resonates with many of us. It is remarkable, however, to appreciate how the current COVID-19 crisis has accelerated the introduction of telemedicine. Although formal evaluations of the current crisis are lacking, the general experience among clinician colleagues and across many care systems has been overwhelmingly positive. Patients and families now have an enhanced understanding of the need for remote visits. There are powerful anecdotes of care delivered remotely, including highly emotional issues, such as the delivery of bad news. Surprisingly, many patients prefer to receive such bad news in the safety of their own home, rather than in the more impersonal clinic environment.\nThe rapidly evolving new experience in daily practice has helped to alleviate many earlier objections against telemedicine. The idea that telemedicine only lends itself for interviewing is untrue; simple neurological assessments can be performed remotely, such as testing for dexterity. Another common concern was that telemedicine is largely restricted to young patients with high levels of education, leaving many other populations underserved. However, during this crisis, adoption of new technologies, although not straightforward, comfortable, or available for all patients and clinicians, has been surprisingly rapid. We must recognize that global society has changed, with many older adults now being customized to using smartphones or videoconferencing.\nLack of reimbursement mechanisms has also impeded a wider introduction of telemedicine services in recent years. We now witness health systems and payers that long struggled to lift the financial barriers quickly implementing critical steps to facilitate the delivery of telemedicine instead of in-person visits. For example, in the Netherlands, the Nederlandse Zorgautoriteit (Dutch Healthcare Authority) rapidly ruled that initial care visits for patients can now be reimbursed based on a telemedicine visit alone. In the US, the COVID-19 crisis is now, at least temporarily, reimbursable for any condition through Medicare and through most supplemental insurance carriers. The US requirement that the patient and clinician must be in the same state has been lifted for Medicare and Medicaid but not for those with private or no insurance. Professional organizations, such as the American Academy of Neurology, have introduced new guidelines for telemedicine visits and addressed the critical legal issues and standards of care.\nThe rapid expansion of telemedicine into current daily practice also comes with challenges. One concern is about privacy and security. Not all publicly available tools for videoconferencing comply with internationally accepted standards to protect each participant\u2019s confidentiality; this applies as much to patients as it does to medical professionals delivering the new remote services. A disconcerting example is the phenomenon of Zoom-bombing, in which anonymous trolls can invade and disturb a teleconference. Clinicians considering offering remote services to patients must therefore take all necessary steps to safeguard the privacy of participants.\nWe hope that this current COVID-19 crisis will soon be resolved. However, it is as the old saying goes: \u201cnever waste a good crisis.\u201d We hope that the telemedicine and remote monitoring advances will persist after the crisis has passed.

More than 180 million students in China were restricted to their homes (http://www.chinanews.com/sh/2020/02-17/9094648.shtml). The COVID-19 infection has become a global pandemic. As of April 9, 2020, the infection has caused 188 countrywide closures around the world and has affected 1\u202f576\u202f021\u202f818 learners (https://zh.unesco.org/themes/education-emergencies/coronavirus-school-closures). The caution about protecting the mental health of children in home confinement is warranted. This study investigated depressive and anxiety symptoms among students in Hubei province, China, which can help optimize interventions on the mental health of children for stakeholders in all countries affected by COVID-19.\nMethods\nIn Hubei province, students in Wuhan were restricted to home from January 23, 2020, and those in Huangshi (a city about 52 mi [85 km] from Wuhan) started observing the restrictions on January 24, 2020. The students in the city of Huangshi remained at home until March 23, 2020, and those in Wuhan until April 8, 2020. A total of 2330 students in grades 2 through 6 in 2 primary schools in Hubei province, of whom 845 were from Wuhan and 1485 were from Huangshi, were invited to complete a survey between February 28 and March 5, 2020. This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology. Students completed the investigation through an online crowdsourcing platform (https://www.wjx.cn/). The survey link was sent to the guardian\u2019s cellular telephone, and the statement \u201cI permit my child to participate in the survey\u201d was presented to the guardian before the survey. The students proceeded to the survey after their guardian had consented. All questionnaires were included in the analysis after a quality audit, with an effective rate of 100.0%.\nInformation included sex, school grade, optimism about the epidemic, whether they worried about being infected by COVID-19, and depressive and anxiety symptoms measured by the Children\u2019s Depression Inventory\u2013Short Form (CDI-S) and the Screen for Child Anxiety Related Emotional Disorders, respectively. Both measures were validated for use in Chinese.1-3 Generalized linear regressions were applied for continuous variables and logistic regressions for binary variables. Results were statistically analyzed with SPSS for Windows 22.0 (IBM) . Statistical significance was defined by P values less than .05.\nResults\nAmong 2330 students, 1784 participants (1012 boys [56.7%]; 1109 children [62.2%] residing in Huangshi) completed the survey, yielding a response rate of 76.6% (Table 1). Students had been restricted to home for a mean (SD) of 33.7 (2.1) days when they completed this survey. A total of 403 students (22.6%) and 337 students (18.9%) reported depressive and anxiety symptoms, respectively. Students in Wuhan had significantly higher CDI-S scores than those in Huangshi (\u03b2, 0.092 [95% CI, 0.014-0.170]), with a greater risk of depressive symptoms (odds ratio, 1.426 [95% CI, 1.138-1.786]). Students who were slightly or not worried about being affected by COVID-19 had significantly lower CDI-S scores than those who were quite worried (\u03b2, \u22120.184 [95% CI, \u22120.273 to \u22120.095]), with a decreased risk of depressive symptoms (odds ratio, 0.521 [95% CI, 0.400-0.679]). Those who were not optimistic about the epidemic, compared with those who were quite optimistic, had significantly higher CDI-S scores (\u03b2, 0.367 [95% CI, 0.250-0.485]), with an increased risk of depressive symptoms (odds ratio 2.262 [95% CI, 1.642-3.117]). There was no significant association between demographic characteristics and anxiety symptoms (Table 2).\nDiscussion\nIn this study, 22.6% of students reported having depressive symptoms, which is higher than other investigations in primary schools of China (17.2%).4 During the outbreak of COVID-19, the reduction of outdoor activities and social interaction may have been associated with an increase in children\u2019s depressive symptoms. Our study found that 18.9% of students reported anxiety symptoms, which is higher than the prevalence in other surveys.5 Severe acute respiratory syndrome in 2003 was also associated with several psychological symptoms among students in China.6 These findings suggest that serious infectious diseases may influence the mental health of children as other traumatic experiences do. A limitation is that our current study could not evaluate whether these outcomes will be long-lasting after the COVID-19 outbreak. We will continue to follow up with these participants to improve our understanding about how long those outcomes will last. A better understanding of how the epidemic affects students\u2019 mental health can help guide future interventions.\nBack to top\nArticle Information\nAcceptance Date: April 14, 2020.\nCorresponding Author: Ranran Song, PhD, MS, Department of Maternal and Child Health and Ministry of Education Key Laboratory of Environment and Health, School of Public Health, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, No. 13 Hangkong Rd, Wuhan 430030, Hubei, China (songranran@hust.edu.cn).\nPublished Online: April 24, 2020. doi:10.1001/jamapediatrics.2020.1619\nAuthor Contributions: Dr Song had full access to all of the data in the study and takes responsibility for the integrity of the data and the accuracy of the data analysis.

One patient developed torsades de pointes.\nMeaning  Clinicians should carefully weigh risks and benefits if considering hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin, with close monitoring of QTc and concomitant medication usage.\nAbstract\nImportance  Administration of hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin for the treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)\u2013associated pneumonia carries increased risk of corrected QT (QTc) prolongation and cardiac arrhythmias.\nObjective  To characterize the risk and degree of QT prolongation in patients with COVID-19 in association with their use of hydroxychloroquine with or without concomitant azithromycin.\nDesign, Setting, and Participants  This was a cohort study performed at an academic tertiary care center in Boston, Massachusetts, of patients hospitalized with at least 1 positive COVID-19 nasopharyngeal polymerase chain reaction test result and clinical findings consistent with pneumonia who received at least 1 day of hydroxychloroquine from March 1, 2020, through April 7, 2020.\nMain Outcomes and Measures  Change in QT interval after receiving hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin; occurrence of other potential adverse drug events.\nResults  Among 90 patients given hydroxychloroquine, 53 received concomitant azithromycin; 44 (48.9%) were female, and the mean (SD) body mass index was 31.5 (6.6). Hypertension (in 48 patients [53.3%]) and diabetes mellitus (in 26 patients [28.9%]) were the most common comorbid conditions. The overall median (interquartile range) baseline QTc was 455 (430-474) milliseconds (hydroxychloroquine, 473 [454-487] milliseconds vs hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin, 442 [427-461] milliseconds; P\u2009<\u2009.001). Those receiving concomitant azithromycin had a greater median (interquartile range) change in QT interval (23 [10-40] milliseconds) compared with those receiving hydroxychloroquine alone (5.5 [\u221215.5 to 34.25] milliseconds; P\u2009=\u2009.03). Seven patients (19%) who received hydroxychloroquine monotherapy developed prolonged QTc of 500 milliseconds or more, and 3 patients (3%) had a change in QTc of 60 milliseconds or more. Of those who received concomitant azithromycin, 11 of 53 (21%) had prolonged QTc of 500 milliseconds or more and 7 of 53 (13 %) had a change in QTc of 60 milliseconds or more. The likelihood of prolonged QTc was greater in those who received concomitant loop diuretics (adjusted odds ratio, 3.38 [95% CI, 1.03-11.08]) or had a baseline QTc of 450 milliseconds or more (adjusted odds ratio, 7.11 [95% CI, 1.75-28.87]). Ten patients had hydroxychloroquine discontinued early because of potential adverse drug events, including intractable nausea, hypoglycemia, and 1 case of torsades de pointes.\nConclusions and Relevance  In this cohort study, patients who received hydroxychloroquine for the treatment of pneumonia associated with COVID-19 were at high risk of QTc prolongation, and concurrent treatment with azithromycin was associated with greater changes in QTc. Clinicians should carefully weigh risks and benefits if considering hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin, with close monitoring of QTc and concomitant medication usage.\nIntroduction\nAs of April 10, 2020, more than 500\u202f000 cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have been reported in the United States, with no US Food and Drug Administration\u2013approved treatments to date.1 Against this backdrop, the use of hydroxychloroquine for COVID-19 treatment has gained traction, appearing in international and domestic therapeutic guidelines.2 The presumed efficacy and widespread use of hydroxychloroquine stemmed from in vitro evaluations of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 1 (SARS-CoV-1) and SARS-CoV-2 and a small prospective study claiming virologic clearance in 6 patients taking hydroxychloroquine with azithromycin.3,4 The combination gained further attention after coverage by the lay press; however, subsequent studies have failed to replicate these findings.5\nAlthough hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin are generally well-tolerated medications used in clinical practice, both can cause corrected QT (QTc) prolongation.6,7 With sweeping usage and perhaps insufficient consideration for comorbidities or concomitant QT-prolonging therapies, the frequency of adverse drug events (ADEs) will likely increase. Furthermore, evidence suggests that patients with underlying cardiac comorbidities are disproportionately affected by COVID-19 and the virus itself provokes myocardial injury.8,9 In this study, we aimed to characterize the risk and degree of QT prolongation in patients with COVID-19 in association with their usage of hydroxychloroquine with or without concomitant azithromycin.\nMethods\nThe study was conducted according to Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center institutional review board standards; informed consent was waived based on the board\u2019s standards. This was a single-center, retrospective, observational study evaluating adults with COVID-19 who were hospitalized at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston, Massachusetts. We included patients admitted between March 1 and April 7, 2020, who received at least 1 day of hydroxychloroquine while inpatients and at least 1 positive COVID-19 nasopharyngeal polymerase chain reaction test result via the Pan Degenerate Amplification and Adaptation (PANDAA) qDx SARS-CoV-2 kit (Aldatu Biosciences). The antimicrobial stewardship team reviewed all hydroxychloroquine orders placed for patients with COVID-19 per internal treatment criteria, which included clinical and radiographic findings, laboratory results, and an electrocardiogram. The standard regimen was 400 mg of hydroxychloroquine twice on day 1, then 400 mg daily on days 2 through 5.\nData were extracted from the electronic medical records and deidentified. Medication administrations, ADEs, and treatment response were reviewed by an infectious disease-specialized pharmacist (N.J.M.) and physician (C.F.Y.). Electrocardiograms were manually evaluated by cardiologists (D.J.S. and T.R.M.) to calculate QTc intervals using the Bazett formula and so-called excess correction method for QRS values greater than 120 milliseconds. The Tisdale score, used to prognosticate QT prolongation in hospitalized patients, was applied retrospectively to evaluate QTc prolongation risk.10 End points of interest were changes in QTc (\u0394QTc) in the cohort and between groups receiving hydroxychloroquine and hydroxychloroquine plus azithromycin, development of prolonged QTc interval to 500 milliseconds or more, and documented ADEs.\nStatistical Analysis\nNominal data were described using proportions. Normally distributed discrete data were described with means and SDs, and medians and interquartile ranges (IQRs) were used to represent data that were not normally distributed. Categorical variables were compared with a \u03c72 or Fisher exact test and described using odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CIs. The Mann-Whitney U test evaluated continuous variables, with a P value of less than .05 to represent the statistical significance threshold. The QTc prolongation risk (\u2265500 milliseconds) was evaluated in a logistic regression model. Covariates evaluated in the Tisdale score and associated with QTc prolongation in univariate analysis (P\u2009<\u2009.10) were included in the multivariable analysis. Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS version 25.0 (IBM).\nResults\nNinety patients were diagnosed with COVID-19 at a median (IQR) of 8 (5-12) days from the time of symptom onset. The mean (SD) age was 60.1 (16.7) years, 44 (48.9%) were women, and the mean (SD) body mass index (calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared) was 31.5 (6.6). The most common comorbidities were hypertension (48 patients [53%]) and diabetes mellitus (26 patients [289%]) (Table 1). Thirty patients (33%) were critically ill at the time of testing, and 23 (26%) were mechanically ventilated. All patients received hydroxychloroquine, and 53 (59%) received hydroxychloroquine plus azithromycin; most patients had at least 1 cardiovascular comorbidity and were taking 2 or more QTc-prolonging medications, and 46 (51%) had a high-risk baseline cumulative Tisdale score of 11 or more points.\nThe median (IQR) baseline QTc was 455 (430-474) milliseconds. With treatment, 10 of 90 patients (11%) had \u0394QTc of 60 milliseconds or more; 18 (20%) had posttreatment QTc intervals of 500 milliseconds or more. Of 37 patients receiving hydroxychloroquine monotherapy, 7 (19%) developed prolonged QTc of 500 milliseconds or more, and 3 (3%) had \u0394QTc of 60 milliseconds or more. With concomitant azithromycin, 11 of 53 patients (21%) had prolonged QTc and 7 (13%) had a \u0394QTc of 60 milliseconds or more (Figure; eFigure 1 in the Supplement). Although the baseline QTc was shorter in patients receiving concomitant azithromycin compared with those taking hydroxychloroquine alone (median [IQR], 442 [427-461] milliseconds vs 473 [454-487] milliseconds; P\u2009<\u2009.001), hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin was associated with a greater change in QTc compared with hydroxychloroquine alone (median [IQR] change, 23 [10-40] milliseconds vs 5.5 [\u221215.5 to 34.3] milliseconds; P\u2009=\u2009.03) (Figure). Patients who were critically ill also had a nonsignificantly greater \u0394QTc than those who were not (median [IQR] change, 26.5 [11-51] milliseconds vs 16 [\u22128 to 35] milliseconds; P\u2009=\u2009.05).\nThe likelihood of prolonged QTc (\u2265500 milliseconds) was greater with concomitant loop diuretic administration (12 of 39 patients [31%] vs 6 of 51 patients [12%]; P\u2009=\u2009.03), or a baseline QTc of 450 milliseconds or more (15 of 50 patients [30%] vs 3 of 40 patients [8%]; P\u2009=\u2009.008). Both remained independently associated after controlling for 2 or more Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome criteria (Table 2). Age, sex, concomitant QT-prolonging medications administration, and comorbidities did not correlate with a QTc of 500 milliseconds or more. Forty-one patients were discharged, 4 died, and 45 remained hospitalized, with a median follow-up of 9 days. Twenty-one patients had repeated nasopharyngeal polymerase chain reaction testing after a median (IQR) of 3.0 (1.0-6.5) days after starting treatment; 0 of 8 (0%) in the hydroxychloroquine group and 1 of 13 (7.7%) in the hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin group had negative results.\nTen patients (11%) stopped taking hydroxychloroquine prior to day 5 of treatment for QTc prolongation. Possible hydroxychloroquine-associated ADEs included intractable nausea, resolving with medication discontinuation; development of new premature ventricular contractions and right bundle branch block; and a suspected case of hydroxychloroquine-associated hypoglycemia on day 2 of therapy, which was also in the context of poor oral intake. One patient who had hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin discontinued because of QTc prolongation (499 milliseconds) developed torsades de pointes 3 days later (eFigures 2 and 3 in the Supplement) and subsequently developed other ventricular arrhythmias that were treated with lidocaine.\nDiscussion\nProponents of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine for COVID-19 treatment cite established safety in patients with autoimmune disorders, in vitro studies, and small nonrandomized clinical trials. However, the patients in these studies are clinically different from patients who were critically ill, infected with COVID-19, and receiving multiple QTc-prolonging medications with extended half-lives, which augment cardiotoxic risks. This was illustrated in a case of torsades de pointes from our cohort. Although hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin administration was discontinued 3 days prior to the event, the patient also had severe acute respiratory distress syndrome, bradycardia, hypothermia, propofol coadministration, and a new cardiomyopathy, raising concerns that the risk of QTc prolongation likely persisted, given the prolonged terminal half-life of each agent (eFigures 2 and 3 in the Supplement).11\nHydroxychloroquine is structurally and mechanistically similar to the class IA antiarrhythmic quinidine, which inhibits voltage-gated sodium and potassium channels, prolonging the QT interval and increasing the risk of torsades de pointes and sudden cardiac death.6 Azithromycin also has been implicated in QTc prolongation and proarrhythmic events; its Food and Drug Administration label highlights the dose-dependent elevation in QTc when combined with chloroquine.8,12 Furthermore, enrollment was halted in a treatment arm for high-dose chloroquine plus azithromycin in a randomized clinical trial for patients hospitalized with severe COVID-19 pneumonia because of preliminary safety concerns about excessive cardiotoxicity.13 Loop diuretics, which were independently associated with prolonged QTc in this study, are also frequently used for severe COVID-19 infection to manage volume and acute respiratory distress syndrome, which should necessitate careful electrolyte management.10\nWithin a 4-week observation period, 21 of 90 patients (23%) treated with hydroxychloroquine or hydroxychloroquine plus azithromycin had either significant QTc prolongation or \u0394QTc of 60 milliseconds or greater. This underscores the American College of Cardiology\u2019s recommendation for baseline risk assessment, frequent QTc monitoring, and strict cutoffs for therapy cessation; the Infectious Diseases Society of America voices similar concerns, recommending targeted antiviral therapeutics be limited to clinical trials.14,15 Ultimately, curtailing hydroxychloroquine-associated ADEs would require a multidisciplinary effort across medicine, infectious diseases, pharmacy, cardiology, critical care, and health care quality.\nLimitations\nWhile hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin administration likely contributed to the observed ADEs, we cannot exclude COVID-19-associated stress cardiomyopathy or myocarditis. Without a control arm, we cannot conclude that hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin conferred increased cardiotoxic risk; however, compared with hydroxychloroquine alone, \u0394QTc differences were likely associated with the addition of azithromycin. It remains possible that the true degree of QTc prolongation was underestimated, given clinical practice variation and a limited follow-up period: 45 patients remained hospitalized, and 19 patients had no follow-up electrocardiograms. However, for the observed duration, \u0394QTc and prolongation findings aligned with preliminary reports of significant QTc prolongation in 11% to 25% of patients.8,13 Higher-risk groups may not have been represented, because institutional guidance recommended against hydroxychloroquine for individuals with prolonged baseline QTc intervals. Numerous factors in this small cohort of adults who had complex, often critical illness could also have confounded clinical and safety end points.\nConclusions\nPatients who were hospitalized and receiving hydroxychloroquine for COVID-19 frequently experienced QTc prolongation and ADEs, including a case of torsades de pointes with administration of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin, which to our knowledge has yet to be reported elsewhere in the literature. There is a critical need for rigorous, large-scale studies and risk-benefit assessment prior to initiating COVID-19 therapeutics, with careful attention to medication interactions, cardiac manifestations, routine electrocardiograms, and electrolyte monitoring.\nBack to top\nArticle Information\nAccepted for Publication: April 17, 2020.\nPublished Online: May 1, 2020. doi:10.1001/jamacardio.2020.1834\nAuthor Contributions: Drs Mercuro and Yen had full access to all the data in the study and take responsibility for the integrity of the data and the accuracy of the data analysis.

Their goal: to understand how social distancing and quarantine efforts during the devastating 1918-1919 influenza pandemic affected death rates in US cities.\nData from 43 large US cities spanning September 8, 1918, through February 22, 1919, showed that nonpharmaceutical interventions\u2014a traditional term for social distancing practices like closing schools and banning large public gatherings\u2014could prevent influenza deaths. In the study, the pandemic took a lesser toll on cities that implemented these interventions earlier and for longer periods.\nEven so, the citizenry can become restless, the study\u2019s lead author, Howard Markel, MD, PhD, explained during a recent interview with JAMA. It happened in Mexico, where social distancing was in effect during the 2009 influenza A(H1N1) pandemic, he noted.\nWhen those practices were relaxed, cases went back up. \u201cThat second hump was never as high as the first hump, but they went up, nevertheless, and then, they pulled back again, and the cases went down,\u201d said Markel, director of the Center for the History of Medicine.\nThe following is an edited version of JAMA\u2019s interview with the noted medical historian.\nJAMA:Can you tell us a little bit about what happened in 1918?\nDr Markel:It was probably the worst contagious crisis in the history of humankind. Around the world, anywhere from 40 to 100 million people died. In America, there were 10 to 14 million cases and at least 500\u202f000 to 750\u202f000 people died. It was a particularly virulent and novel strain of influenza. A lot of young adults were struck down. It\u2019s also important to recall that 1918 was when the United States of America entered World War I. Four to 5 million young men were sent to army camps all over the country by train, in not the most sanitary conditions. These young men were not only victims to influenza, but they were also terrific vectors for the virus.\n\nNobody knew much about virology at all. There was a great deal of knowledge about bacteriology, but no one knew what the etiologic agent of influenza was. In fact, many thought it was the bacterium Haemophilus influenzae. And a lot of people who died didn\u2019t just die of influenza. They died of secondary bacterial pneumonia. In 1918, there were no antibiotics, let alone antivirals. There were no intravenous fluids and medical care was really kind of warehousing of these young men and women.\nJAMA:How does the COVID-19 pandemic compare to the 1918 influenza pandemic?\nDr Markel:They\u2019re both spread by respiratory droplets but SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) is a very different virus and, most importantly, it\u2019s a novel virus. Because it\u2019s so new, we\u2019re really kind of flying by the seat of our pants. We\u2019re finding out things as we go along, and we\u2019re finding out more and more and at a faster rate than ever in human history. But we\u2019re still trying to unlock the mysteries of COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019).\nJAMA:Have nonpharmaceutical interventions like social distancing and quarantine evolved since 1918?\nDr Markel:Quarantine originated back in the 1370s in Venice to combat plague. It literally meant 40 days. That was the amount of time that ships had to stand in the lagoon, and they could not unload their goods or passengers. Ever since then, quarantine has been fine-tuned and changed.\n\nIn 1918 they didn\u2019t have many tools in their toolbox, and these traditional ones of isolating the ill, quarantining people you suspect had contact with the ill, school closures and public gathering bans, as well as public service announcements, were pretty much all they had. America was a very different country. Not everyone owned a car, let alone had a telephone. There wasn\u2019t connectivity. Moms mostly stayed at home, so school closure wasn\u2019t nearly as big of a deal as today when 70% of mothers work outside of the home. Every city that we looked at in our study did something, but not every city had as good of a result, in terms of morbidity and mortality. So, we wanted to find out why.\nJAMA:What did you find?\nDr Markel:Cities that implemented early, layered, and long-duration interventions had a far better mortality and morbidity rate than those that did not. And that is where the thesis for what has now been called \u201cflattening the curve\u201d emerged.\n\nOur theory was, what if these interventions would flatten that curve and extend it over many more days? That would, perhaps, allow fewer people to get sick and die. It would also create a situation where fewer people were rushing to the hospitals or clinics at the same time and overrunning their capacity. That\u2019s exactly what these cities showed, and that was very exciting to us. Today, unlike in 1918 and \u201919, we hope that modern medicine could use that extra time to develop medical therapies and, even better, a vaccine.\nJAMA:One of the present worries is the toll that the current pandemic is taking on our health care infrastructure. In 1918, did they see strains on their health care systems?\nDr Markel:It\u2019s hard to compare because the health care system is so vastly different, but it did overwhelm their hospital systems. They weren\u2019t nearly equipped. There weren\u2019t as many hospitals. In 1918, most people who were of means wouldn\u2019t be caught dead in a hospital. Those were places for poor people, and many Americans of that era preferred to get sick and be cared for in their homes. But their health systems were overwhelmed. Their doctors and nurses were overwhelmed. Their resources were overwhelmed.\n\nThe cities that had the highest morbidity and mortality rates\u2014specifically Pittsburgh, which was the worst in the country, and Philadelphia, which was the second from worst\u2014also had a really disorganized public health effort. They did their measures late. They were struck early in the epidemic. There were lots of petty fights between different levels of government. These internecine battles between politicians, time and again, have a very negative effect on the administration of good pandemic care. This is something I worry about at present because we\u2019re seeing a lot of squabbles and fighting. I would argue that in times of contagious crisis, politics have to end with the microbe. We have to all work together to come up with the best policies and the best methods to ensure the health of the American people.\nJAMA:In 1918, what was the standard personal protective equipment?\nDr Markel:Face masks were the big thing, and there was a shortage of surgical face masks, which were then made of gauze. There were a lot of American Red Cross chapters, mostly of women who volunteered for the war effort and fashioned face masks out of gauze or linen or whatever material they had. There were articles in the newspaper about some women who wore fashionable face masks made out of chiffon. There were all sorts of stories about this mask or that mask but of course these masks were so porous, so it\u2019s highly doubtful they gave much protection.\nJAMA:How did the way information about influenza got out to the public compare with today?\nDr Markel:The leading source of information would have been the newspaper. There was no radio or television, but newspapers put out 6 or more editions per day. Many cities had, 3, 4, 5 newspapers. But the media covered the flu epidemic as closely as modern newspapers. It was all flu all the time, and you could read good stories and silly stories. There\u2019d be ads for snake oil alongside an important story by the commissioner of health of that city.\n\nWhat\u2019s different now in our world of social media and the internet is that good stories and bad stories are amplified at a level that\u2019s truly painful to the ears. That\u2019s one issue. The second thing is that information travels at the speed of electrons. And the third problem is that information is no longer just democratized, it\u2019s atomized. So, everyone reads the news source they want or that appeals to them, and there\u2019s a concept that everyone is entitled to their own facts. Well, no, that\u2019s silly. There are scientific facts. Frequently, those facts are revised. Sometimes they\u2019re wrong. But we work to correct them, and you\u2019re not entitled to your own set of facts about infectious diseases and pandemics.\nJAMA:There have been disheartening reports of xenophobia during the current pandemic. Was there any sense of the same phenomenon in 1918?\nDr Markel:I spent a lot of my career studying precisely that issue, people who were stigmatized and blamed for contagious crises across history. That is certainly one of the major themes of pandemics past and, sadly, present. But in 1918, unlike all these other epidemics or pandemics that I\u2019ve studied, there wasn\u2019t a lot of xenophobia. We found 2 newspaper clips blaming Italian immigrants. My theory is that influenza spread so widely and so quickly across various levels of the population in America and elsewhere that it was hard to scapegoat anybody. It was hard to blame a particular group, but that\u2019s the exception to the rule.\nJAMA:Are there any lasting systemwide changes that you foresee coming out of the current pandemic based on historical experience?\nDr Markel:Across human history concealment is a very common theme; the Chinese government concealed SARS for a while. These concealments give the microbe a running head start, and in our tiny world, we can no longer afford that. An outbreak anywhere can easily go everywhere, and we have to work together not just at the local, state, and even the federal, but also the international level. There has to be cooperation and surveillance in each country. There has to be open and transparent reporting, and there have to be active and rapid responses when outbreaks are discovered.\n\nThe worst thing about the last act of every epidemic or pandemic I\u2019ve ever studied is something I call global amnesia. We tend to forget about it, and the political actors go on to the next issue and don\u2019t do the funding that needs to be done for steady preparedness. I\u2019m sure you have a fire department in your city, and I bet your house never burnt down. But I also bet you\u2019re glad you have a fire department and you pay taxes for that because, in the event that your house does burn down, they\u2019ll help you. I use that metaphor for our public health enterprise, from the local to the international level. When it works at its best, we don\u2019t know about infectious diseases because they don\u2019t break out. But we need to prepare all the time. If COVID-19 teaches us nothing but that, then I think we\u2019ll have a healthier world.", "jamanetworkopen.2020.6785": "Introduction\nThe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak was first identified in Wuhan, the capital of Hubei Province, China, in December 2019.1 The disease spread rapidly from Wuhan to other cities. To contain this epidemic, Wuhan was locked down on January 23, 2020. Wenzhou, which has a population of 9.3 million and is located in southeastern China approximately 600 miles from Wuhan, is the most affected Chinese city outside of Hubei. Approximately 48\u202f800 people traveled from Wuhan to Wenzhou from January 10 to 23, 2020. As of February 15, 2020, there were 502 confirmed cases of COVID-19 but no deaths reported in Wenzhou. To stop the spread of COVID-19 in Wenzhou, multiple community containment approaches were implemented beginning January 24, 2020, including quarantine, isolation, traffic control, and social distancing (Figure). This decision analytical model examined several key epidemiological features of imported COVID-19 cases in Wenzhou.\nMethods\nThis study was approved by the ethics committees of Sir Run Run Shaw Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine and Women\u2019s Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine, with a waiver of informed consent granted because the data were deidentified. This study follows the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) reporting guideline.\nAll confirmed COVID-19 cases reported to the Municipal Health Commission of Wenzhou from January 21 to February 15, 2020, were included in our analysis. Proportions for categorical variables were compared using 2-sided Fisher exact tests with statistical significance set at P\u2009<\u2009.05. The reproduction number R0 was estimated using the exponential growth method.2 The susceptible-asymptomatic-symptomatic-quarantined-isolated-removed model was used to simulate the dynamics of the COVID-19 epidemic (eAppendix in the Supplement).3 Data were calculated using the FME package in R statistical software version 1.3.6.1 (R Project for Statistical Computing). Data analysis was conducted from February 2020 to March 2020.\nResults\nA total of 482 patients (median age, 48 years; interquartile range, 37-56 years) were included in our analysis. The median age of patients with COVID-19 in Wenzhou who were Wuhan residents was 45 years (interquartile range, 35-53 years), which was 5 years younger than patients who were not Wuhan residents (median, 50 years; interquartile range, 40-61 years) (P\u2009<\u2009.001). Overall, 228 patients (47.3%) were female, and no sex difference was associated with Wuhan residency (81 female patients [43.8%] who were Wuhan residents vs 147 female patients [49.5%] who were not Wuhan residents; P\u2009=\u2009.26). The time between onset of symptoms and diagnosis ranged from 0 to 23 days, with a median of 6 days. Most patients had a fever (317 patients [65.8%]) and cough (232 patients [48.1%]) at disease onset. Other common symptoms at onset included hypodynamia (59 patients [12.2%]), sore throat (50 patients [10.4%]), headache (35 patients [7.3%]), chills (31 patients [6.4%]), and diarrhea (27 patients [5.6%]). Patients who were Wuhan residents were statistically significantly more likely to have chills (18 patients [9.7%] vs 13 patients [4.4%]; P\u2009=\u2009.02) and sore throat (30 patients [16.2%] vs 20 patients [6.7%]; P\u2009=\u2009.001) compared with patients who were not Wuhan residents (Table).\nThe basic reproduction number, R0, of patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 was estimated as 2.9 (95% CI, 1.8-4.5) in Wenzhou, which is within the range of those recently reported.4-6 This indicated that 1 case would produce, on average, 2.9 secondary cases in susceptible populations without any intervention measures.\nThe susceptible-asymptomatic-symptomatic-quarantined-isolated-removed model was used to simulate the spread of COVID-19 starting on January 21, 2020, in Wenzhou (Figure). Comparison of simulated and reported cumulative cases revealed that our model mimicked the actual spread well. Our estimates suggested that the epidemic would gradually vanish in late February and end in early March after the implementation of community containment approaches in Wenzhou. Then, we used our model to evaluate the impact of 4 different measures on total cumulative number of cases 6 months later. Our simulation showed that the intensity and starting time of control and prevention measures had major impacts on the spread of COVID-19. It is essential to prevent coronavirus transmission between susceptible and infected individuals by quarantine, isolation, and fewer contacts. The total mean (SEM) cumulative number of cases 6 months later would decrease to 440\u2009(16) if the quarantine of infected individuals from the general population before they develop clinical symptoms (ie, asymptomatic individuals) was increased by 50% from the baseline. In contrast, the mean (SEM) number of cumulative cases would increase to 15\u202f576\u2009(1554) if measures were delayed for 5 days after the first diagnosed case. Similarly, the epidemic curves were constructed in Wuhan, suggesting that the COVID-19 epidemic would not stop until early April 2020.\nDiscussion\nOur epidemic analysis demonstrated that the timely community containment approaches implemented in Wenzhou were associated with the end of the COVID-19 epidemic in early March 2020. These findings suggest that quarantine of asymptomatic individuals is as important as isolation (hospitalization) of infected individuals with symptoms. Therefore, it is recommended that countries with severe epidemics strengthen epidemiological investigations and increase quarantine of close-contact individuals, especially when medical resources are scarce. A limitation of our epidemic analysis is that it is data-driven and limited by its applicability; however, these data have important implications in forecasting and preventing the potential spread of COVID-19 outbreaks in other countries.\nBack to top\nArticle Information\nAccepted for Publication: March 29, 2020.\nPublished: April 23, 2020. doi:10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2020.6785\nOpen Access: This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the CC-BY License. \u00a9 2020 Han Y et al.

Written informed consent was waived owing to the urgent need to collect data. Data were obtained from 21 hospitals in Wuhan, China. Demographic, comorbidity, and respiratory support data for 168 patients who died of COVID-19 between January 21 to 30, 2020, in these hospitals were collected. All patients were diagnosed as having COVID-19 according to World Health Organization guidance.3 All patients underwent nucleic acid testing by reverse transcription\u2013polymerase chain reaction testing, and their results were positive for COVID-19. Categorical variables were described as numbers (proportions) and continuous variables were described as medians and interquartile ranges (IQRs). Data were analyzed from February 8 to February 10, 2020.\nResults\nOf 168 patients who died, 126 (75.0%) were men. The median (IQR) age was 70 (64-78) years, and 161 patients (95.8%) were older than 50 years. The age distribution of men and women patients is presented in the Figure, A. Most patients (125 patients [74.4%]) had 1 or more comorbidities. The Figure, B, presents the distribution of chronic comorbidities among these patients. Hypertension was the most common comorbidity (84 patients [50.0%]), followed by diabetes (42 patients [25.0%]), and ischemic heart disease (31 patients [18.5%]).\nAll patients received oxygen therapy during their hospital stay. However, 46 patients (27.4%) only received nasal or face mask oxygen before they died (Figure, C). In addition, approximately one-third of patients (58 patients [34.5%]) received high-flow nasal oxygen therapy, and 72 patients (42.9%) received noninvasive ventilation. However, only 34 patients (20.2%) were intubated and received invasive mechanical ventilation, and 2 patients (1.2%) received extracorporeal membrane oxygenation treatment. Age was not a factor associated with intubation.\nDiscussion\nThe results of this case series show that only approximately one-fifth of patients who died of COVID-19 received invasive mechanical ventilation and further aggressive respiratory support prior to death, indicating that many patients had delayed intubation. A 2015 study showed that delayed intubation after the failure of high-flow nasal oxygen or noninvasive ventilation for patients with moderate and severe respiratory failure was associated with increased mortality.4 Additionally, approximately 27% of patients only received nasal or face mask oxygen treatment before they died. Several reasons may explain this low proportion. First, some patients with severe hypoxemia did not have other symptoms, such as shortness of breath or dyspnea, also called silent hypoxemia. Second, the lack of enough invasive mechanical ventilators is an important reason that would prevent patients from receiving intubation. Third, a medical team that is not dominated by intensivists may not receive critical care training; therefore, they may be uncertain on the timing for when a patient requires intubation.\nAnother interesting finding of this case series is that hypertension was the most common chronic comorbidity among patients who died. A previous 2020 case series1 also reported a higher rate of hypertension among patients with COVID-19 who were admitted to intensive care units than among patients with COVID-19 who were not admitted to intensive care units. However, hypertension usually is not an independent risk factor associated with mortality in patients with sepsis.5 According to a study from earlier this year,6 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infects the lungs through the angiotensin-converting enzyme II receptor. Further research is needed to find the mechanism of COVID-19. In addition, clinical studies are also needed to confirm whether angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers could be beneficial for patients with COVID-19.\nOur study has some limitations. One limitation is that our data were from patients who died during late January 2019, and they may not be representative of later cases of COVID-19.\nThis case series found that delayed intubation was common in the early stage of the COVID-19 epidemic in Wuhan. Potential reasons for the delay include lack of invasive mechanical ventilators and lack of specific clinical training for respiratory support.\nBack to top\nArticle Information\nAccepted for Publication: March 12, 2020.\nPublished: April 10, 2020. doi:10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2020.5619\nOpen Access: This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the CC-BY License. \u00a9 2020 Xie J et al.

It was first reported in Wuhan, Hubei province, China, at the end of 2019 and was transmitted to multiple regions of China and subsequently to many countries in the East and the West. As of March 30, 2020, the number of patients infected with COVID-19 has rapidly reached 693\u202f224 globally, especially across the North American, European, and Eastern Mediterranean regions, including in the US, Italy, Spain, and Iran.1 The rapid transmission of COVID-19, high fatality rates in subpopulations, lack of effective treatments and vaccines, and mass quarantine measures have led to common mental health problems, such as fear, anxiety, depression, and sleep problems, in patients with COVID-19 infections, close contacts, the public, and even health care professionals.2,3 Therefore, there is a pressing need to establish appropriate mental health services to address the risk of psychiatric morbidities. Mental health professionals are facing insurmountable challenges because of the lack of relevant guidelines, scant mental health resources, and inadequate training to provide mental health services in isolation infectious units and hospitals. Patients with serious psychiatric needs are considered a highly vulnerable population to contract COVID-19. For example, hundreds of patients with psychiatric disorders, as well as mental health professionals, were infected in China.4 As such, a joint effort to establish international collaboration is urgently needed to address the mental health challenges caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.\nTo reduce the risk of negative psychological outcomes associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, the Central Health Authority of China and different national academic societies have integrated mental health crisis interventions into the general deployment of disease prevention and treatment. More than 20 specific guidelines and expert consensus for mental health services for the COVID-19 outbreak were disseminated by the end of February 20205 to provide timely guidance for frontline health care professionals. External mental health expert teams in other provinces were also established to provide emergency mental health services in Hubei province, China. In addition, widespread adoption of online public education, psychological counseling, and hotline services have been set up for those in need. Consequently, these measures may have reduced the negative mental health outcomes of the COVID-19 pandemic, as evidenced by 2 recent surveys. One was conducted in an early stage of the COVID-19 outbreak from the end of January to early February 2020, and it reported the prevalence of insomnia symptoms (34.0%) in frontline health care professionals.6 We conducted another survey at the end of February 2020, which found that the prevalence of poor sleep quality in frontline health care professionals was 18.4% (written communication, Y. Zhou, Y. Yang, T. Shi, Y. Song, Y. Zhou, Z. Zhang, Y. Guo, X. Li, Y. Liu, G. Xu, T. Cheung, Y.T. Xiang, and Y. Tang, February 19, 2020). While direct comparison of these different surveys should be cautious, the results suggest some benefits on sleep quality from a range of mental health measures adopted across China. The COVID-19 transmission has been effectively controlled in most areas of China, and 3 major key points should be considered in tackling the mental health challenges caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.\nFirst, China should take a proactive lead to share its protocol of emergency mental health services with other countries affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Second, international academic organizations, such as the World Psychiatric Association and the Pacific Rim College of Psychiatrists, should develop guidelines on crisis psychological interventions, organize expert teams to coordinate mental health resources, and provide timely advice to different countries affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Large-scale epidemiological surveys should be conducted to examine the prevalence of mental health problems associated with the COVID-19 pandemic in different subpopulations (eg, elderly individuals, survivors of COVID-19 infections, and frontline health care professionals) to inform the development of appropriate mental health services. Third, leading academic organizations equipped with mental health expertise on crisis mental health interventions (eg, the American Psychiatric Association in the US) should readily share their experiences and guidelines with low- and middle-income countries that are also affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. With a timely and close collaboration with different nations and institutions, the mental health challenges caused by the COVID-19 pandemic can be adequately addressed.\nBack to top\nArticle Information\nCorresponding Author: Yu-Tao Xiang, MD, PhD, Unit of Psychiatry, Institute of Translational Medicine, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Macau, Avenida da Universidade, 3/F, Building E12, Taipa, Macao Special Administrative Region, China (xyutly@gmail.com).\nPublished Online: April 10, 2020. doi:10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2020.1057\nAuthor Contributions: Drs Xiang and Jin contributed equally to this work.\nConflict of Interest Disclosures: The study was supported by the National Science and Technology Major Project for investigational new drugs (grant 2018ZX09201-014), the Beijing Municipal Science & Technology Commission (grant Z181100001518005), and the University of Macau (grant MYRG2019-00066-FHS).

After a sample is collected, RNA, which is part of the virus particle, is extracted and converted to complementary DNA for testing. The PCR test involves binding sequences on the DNA that only are found in the virus and repeatedly copying everything in between. This process is repeated many times, with doubling of the target region with each cycle. A fluorescent signal is created when amplification occurs, and once the signal reaches a threshold, the test result is considered positive. If no viral sequence is present, amplification will not occur, resulting in a negative result.\nShould You Be Tested?\nGuidelines for testing for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus responsible for COVID-19, continue to evolve as knowledge of COVID-19 improves and availability of testing increases. Currently, testing in the US is only performed for individuals when a positive result will change treatment. Testing is also prioritized for people who have a high risk for bad outcomes from COVID-19 infection, such as elderly or immunosuppressed patients, and those with high risk of exposure and transmission of the disease to other people, such as health care workers. Recommendations for testing are regularly updated by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). If you have questions about testing, contact your local public health department.\nWhy Has Adoption of Testing Been Slow in the US?\nRegulatory process and time required to validate clinical tests. The regulatory process in the US is designed to ensure patient safety and accurate diagnostic testing. Testing was initially only offered through an assay developed by the CDC; however, only a limited number of test kits were available. Alternate tests required Emergency Use Authorization from the US Food and Drug Administration before use. This policy was changed on February 29, 2020, to allow use of tests before approval, which has improved access.\nInitial lack of certified laboratories with PCR capabilities. Most clinical laboratories did not have the capability to perform PCR at the beginning of the outbreak. Skilled laboratories and technicians are needed for PCR, as contamination at any step drastically changes results.\nShortage of chemicals and supplies. Certain chemicals and supplies, such as those used in extraction and PCR kits, were initially in short supply. Reagents have become more available as alternative PCR tests are developed. Personal protective equipment for technicians handling specimens has also been limited.\nAre Alternative Tests Available?\nBlood antibody testing and viral antigen testing in respiratory samples, similar to the rapid influenza test, are currently being investigated. The clinical value of these tests is not known yet, and challenges such as cross-reactivity with other viruses, and that sometimes the test does not detect the virus when it is there, need to be addressed.\nFor More information\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention.

These results support current guidelines and societal recommendations for treating hypertension.\nAbstract\nImportance  Data are lacking whether patients with hypertension who are taking angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) have increased severity or risk of mortality during hospitalization for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).\nObjective  To investigate the association between ACEIs/ARBs and severity of illness and mortality in patients with hypertension hospitalized for COVID-19 infection.\nDesign, Setting, and Participants  Retrospective, single-center case series of the 1178 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 infections at the Central Hospital of Wuhan, China, from January 15 to March 15, 2020.\nMain Outcomes and Measures  COVID-19 was confirmed by real-time reverse transcription\u2013polymerase chain reaction and epidemiologic, clinical, radiologic, laboratory, and drug therapy data were analyzed in all patients. The percentage of patients with hypertension taking ACEIs/ARBs was compared between those with severe vs nonsevere illness and between survivors vs nonsurvivors.\nResults  Of the 1178 patients with COVID-19, the median age was 55.5 years (interquartile range, 38-67 years) and 545 (46.3%) were men. The overall in-hospital mortality was 11.0%. There were 362 patients with hypertension (30.7% of the total group; median age, 66.0 years [interquartile range, 59-73 years]; 189 [52.2%] were men), of whom 115 (31.8%) were taking ACEI/ARBs. The in-hospital mortality in the patients with hypertension was 21.3%. The percentage of patients with hypertension taking ACEIs/ARBs did not differ between those with severe and nonsevere infections (32.9% vs 30.7%; P\u2009=\u2009.65) nor did it differ between nonsurvivors and survivors (27.3% vs 33.0%; P\u2009=\u2009.34). Similar findings were observed when data were analyzed for patients taking ACEIs and those taking ARBs.\nConclusions and Relevance  This study provides clinical data on the association between ACEIs/ARBs and outcomes in patients with hypertension hospitalized with COVID-19 infections, suggesting that ACEIs/ARBs are not associated with the severity or mortality of COVID-19 in such patients. These data support current guidelines and societal recommendations for treating hypertension during the COVID-19 pandemic.\nIntroduction\nThe epidemiology and clinical characterization of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been reported.1-3 As angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) 2 serves as the receptor for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 to gain entry into cells,4 ACE2-expressing cells are susceptible to COVID-19 infection.5 The use of ACE inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) is common treatment in cardiovascular disorders, including hypertension, and data regarding the association of these drugs with ACE2 levels are conflicting.6,7 However, to our knowledge, there are no clinical data indicating whether patients with hypertension who are taking ACEIs/ARBs have increased severity of illness or risk of mortality during COVID-19 infection and whether these patients should continue to use ACEIs/ARBs or switch to other antihypertensive drugs.\nMethods\nPatients with COVID-19 admitted to the Central Hospital of Wuhan (Hubei Province, China) from January 15, 2020, to March 15, 2020, were included in this retrospective analysis. The study was approved by the institutional ethics board of the Central Hospital of Wuhan and the requirement for informed consent was waived because of the retrospective nature of the study. Epidemiologic, clinical characterization, radiologic, laboratory, treatment, and clinical outcomes data were collected and analyzed.\nDefinitions\nThe severity of COVID-19 pneumonia was classified according to the diagnosis and treatment scheme for COVID-19 of Chinese (5th edition).1 Severe illness was defined as blood oxygen saturation levels of 93% or less, respiratory frequency of 30/min or greater, a partial pressure of arterial oxygen to fraction of inspired oxygen ratio of less than 300, lung infiltrates more than 50% within 24 to 48 hours, septic shock, respiratory failure, and/or multiple organ dysfunction or failure. Nonsevere illness was defined as the absence of the previously described characteristics. Hypertension was defined as a history of diastolic blood pressure of 90 mm Hg or greater or a systolic blood pressure of 140 mm Hg or greater or history of antihypertensive medication use.8 A patient\u2019s ACEI/ARB use was defined as use of these drugs at the time of admission that continued through hospitalization.\nStatistical Analysis\nContinuous and categorical variables were represented as median (interquartile range [IQR]) and numbers (%), respectively, with comparisons using the Mann-Whitney U test, t test, \u03c72 test, or Fisher exact test. A 2-sided \u03b1 of less than .05 was considered statistically significant. All the analyses were done using SPSS, version 20 (IBM).\nResults\nAs of March 15, 2020, there were 1178 patients hospitalized with COVID-19. The median age was 55.5 years and 545 (46.3%) were men. There were 130 in-hospital deaths (mortality rate, 11.0%), of whom 84 (64.6%) were men. Among the 1178 patients, there were 362 patients with hypertension (30.7%). The characteristics and clinical outcomes of the patients with hypertension compared with those without hypertension are summarized in the eTable in the Supplement. Patients with hypertension were older and had greater prevalence of chronic diseases; they also had more severe manifestations of COVID-19, including higher rates of acute respiratory distress syndrome and greater in-hospital mortality (21.3% vs 6.5%; P\u2009<\u2009.001).\nThe 362 patients with hypertension were further analyzed and form the basis of this article. There were 189 men (52.2%), 259 (71.5%) were older than 60 years, and 115 (31.8%) were taking ACEIs/ARBs. In-hospital mortality was 21.3% (n\u2009=\u200977). The characteristics and clinical outcomes of these patients are summarized in Table 1 with respect to treatment with ACEIs/ARBs. Aside from a greater prevalence of coronary artery disease in those taking ACEIs/ARBs, patients with and without ACEI/ARB treatment had similar comorbidities and, with the exception of higher alkaline phosphatase in those not taking ACEIs/ARBs, had similar laboratory profile results, including blood cell counts, inflammatory markers, renal and liver function tests, and cardiac biomarkers. The frequency of severity of illness, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and mortality did not differ with respect to ACEI/ARB therapy.\nThe characteristics of patients with severe vs nonsevere infections and survivors vs nonsurvivors are presented in Table 2 along with antihypertensive treatments. The most commonly used antihypertensive drugs were calcium-channel blockers. The percentage of patients with hypertension taking any drug or drug combination did not differ between those with severe and nonsevere infections and nonsurvivors and survivors.\nWith respect to ACEI/ARB use, there was no difference between those with severe vs nonsevere illness in use of ACEIs (9.2% vs 10.1%; P\u2009=\u2009.80), ARBs (24.9% vs 21.2%; P\u2009=\u2009.40), or the composite of ACEIs/ARBs (32.9% vs 30.7%; P\u2009=\u2009.65). Similarly, there were no differences between nonsurvivors and survivors in use of ACEIs (9.1% vs 9.8%; P\u2009=\u2009.85), ARBs (19.5% vs 23.9%; P\u2009=\u2009.42), or the composite of ACEIs/ARBs (27.3% vs 33.0%; P\u2009=\u2009.34).\nBecause comorbidities may affect treatment options for hypertension, we analyzed the use of ACEIs/ARBs among patients with hypertension and various comorbid conditions, including coronary heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, diabetes, neurological disease, and chronic renal disease, with respect to disease progression and mortality (Table 3). In patients with each of these chronic conditions, the frequency of severe illness and death did not differ between those treated with and without ACEIs/ARBs.\nDiscussion\nIn this study, we report data demonstrating that there was no difference in the disease progression and risk of death during hospitalization for COVID-19 with respect to various antihypertensive drugs and in the use of ACEIs/ARBs between those with severe vs nonsevere illness and between nonsurvivors and survivors. Further, there was no difference in comorbidities associated with hypertension and the length of hospital stay in patients who were taking ACEIs/ARBs or non\u2013ACEIs/ARBs.\nThe prevalence of hypertension in our patient cohort (30.7%) is similar to that reported in previous studies in which 15.0% to 31.2% of patients with COVID-19 infection had hypertension.2,9-11 Our findings also confirm data in these prior reports that patients with hypertension have more severe illness and higher mortality rates than those without hypertension. However, these previous reports did not indicate how many patients were taking ACEIs or ARBs.2,9-11 Based on previously reported data, it was legitimate to assume that an association may exist between ACEI or ARB therapy and disease severity or risk of death in patients with hypertension infected with COVID-19. Our data provide some reassurance that ACEIs/ARBs are not associated with the progression or outcome of COVID-19 hospitalizations in patients with hypertension.\nLevels of ACE2 are a double-edged sword. On one hand, the increased expression of ACE2 may facilitate infection with COVID-19 and increase the risk of developing severe and fatal COVID-19.12 On the other hand, decreased expression of ACE2 can induce pulmonary edema and reduce lung function, which can be reversed by recombinant ACE213 or losartan14; therefore, increased expression of ACE2 appears to be protective against acute lung injury. Currently, almost all major societies recommend that patients with hypertension do not discontinue using ACEIs, ARBs, or other renin-angiotensin-aldosterone antagonists in this setting15 except for clinical reasons rather than COVID-19. The clinical data in the current report support these societal recommendations.\nIn this study, we found that patients with hypertension had more than 3 times the mortality rate of all other patients hospitalized with COVID-19. Hypertension combined with cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases, diabetes, and chronic kidney disease would predispose patients to an increased risk of severity and mortality of COVID-19. Therefore, patients with these underlying conditions who develop COVID-19 require particularly intensive surveillance and care.\nLimitations\nThis study was limited by a small number of patients with hypertension taking ACEIs/ARBs who were hospitalized with COVID-19. The current findings may not be generalizable to all patients with hypertension, and it is possible that ACEIs/ARBs could affect the chance of hospitalization. This could not be evaluated in the current data set and warrants further research. In this cohort, a nonsevere disease course of COVID-19 was still severe enough to require hospitalization. In addition, it is not certain whether the ACEI/ARB treatment at baseline was maintained throughout the hospitalization for all patients. Finally, this is an observational treatment comparison and may be biased by differences in patients taking vs not taking ACEIs/ARBs at the time of hospitalization. However, the measured baseline characteristics were similar in both groups (Table 1), suggesting that these groups are reasonably comparable.\nConclusions\nThe current findings did not identify an association between treatment with ACEIs/ARBs and either severity or clinical outcomes of COVID-19 hospitalizations in patients with hypertension. These data support current guidelines and societal recommendations for treating hypertension during the COVID-19 pandemic.\nBack to top\nArticle Information\nAccepted for Publication: April 7, 2020.\nCorresponding Author: Juyi Li, MD (ljywxf110@163.com), Aiping Deng, BS (dapyxb@163.com), and Hongmei Zhang, MD (zhm7001@163.com), The Central Hospital of Wuhan, No. 21 Shengli Rd, Wuhan 430021, China.\nPublished Online: April 23, 2020. doi:10.1001/jamacardio.2020.1624\nAuthor Contributions: Prof Deng and Dr Li had full access to all of the data in the study and take responsibility for the integrity of the data and the accuracy of the data analysis.

The limited sample size did not allow the study to show any benefit overall regarding treatment efficacy.\nMeaning  The preliminary findings from the CloroCovid-19 trial suggest that higher dosage of chloroquine should not be recommended for the treatment of severe COVID-19, especially among patients also receiving azithromycin and oseltamivir, because of safety concerns regarding QTc interval prolongation and increased lethality.\nAbstract\nImportance  There is no specific antiviral therapy recommended for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). In vitro studies indicate that the antiviral effect of chloroquine diphosphate (CQ) requires a high concentration of the drug.\nObjective  To evaluate the safety and efficacy of 2 CQ dosages in patients with severe COVID-19.\nDesign, Setting, and Participants  This parallel, double-masked, randomized, phase IIb clinical trial with 81 adult patients who were hospitalized with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection was conducted from March 23 to April 5, 2020, at a tertiary care facility in Manaus, Brazilian Amazon.\nInterventions  Patients were allocated to receive high-dosage CQ (ie, 600 mg CQ twice daily for 10 days) or low-dosage CQ (ie, 450 mg twice daily on day 1 and once daily for 4 days).\nMain Outcomes and Measures  Primary outcome was reduction in lethality by at least 50% in the high-dosage group compared with the low-dosage group. Data presented here refer primarily to safety and lethality outcomes during treatment on day 13. Secondary end points included participant clinical status, laboratory examinations, and electrocardiogram results. Outcomes will be presented to day 28. Viral respiratory secretion RNA detection was performed on days 0 and 4.\nResults  Out of a predefined sample size of 440 patients, 81 were enrolled (41 [50.6%] to high-dosage group and 40 [49.4%] to low-dosage group). Enrolled patients had a mean (SD) age of 51.1 (13.9) years, and most (60 [75.3%]) were men. Older age (mean [SD] age, 54.7 [13.7] years vs 47.4 [13.3] years) and more heart disease (5 of 28 [17.9%] vs 0) were seen in the high-dose group. Viral RNA was detected in 31 of 40 (77.5%) and 31 of 41 (75.6%) patients in the low-dosage and high-dosage groups, respectively. Lethality until day 13 was 39.0% in the high-dosage group (16 of 41) and 15.0% in the low-dosage group (6 of 40). The high-dosage group presented more instance of QTc interval greater than 500 milliseconds (7 of 37 [18.9%]) compared with the low-dosage group (4 of 36 [11.1%]). Respiratory secretion at day 4 was negative in only 6 of 27 patients (22.2%).\nConclusions and Relevance  The preliminary findings of this study suggest that the higher CQ dosage should not be recommended for critically ill patients with COVID-19 because of its potential safety hazards, especially when taken concurrently with azithromycin and oseltamivir. These findings cannot be extrapolated to patients with nonsevere COVID-19.\nTrial Registration  ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04323527\nIntroduction\nThe first cases of the new coronavirus 2019 disease (COVID-19) were reported in December 2019 when a group of patients was admitted to hospitals in Wuhan, the capital of Hubei province in central China, with an initial diagnosis of pneumonia of unknown etiology.1 Initially, the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was confined to Hubei province, but it rapidly spread to many other countries,2,3 compelling the World Health Organization to officially declare a global pandemic on March 11, 2020. SARS-CoV-2 infection appears to cause a wide range of symptoms.4,5 Most deaths involve older adults, many of whom had underlying chronic diseases.6,7\nRecent publications have drawn attention to the possible benefit of chloroquine diphosphate (CQ) and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) for the treatment of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection.8-13 Both drugs have been used for the treatment of acute malaria as well as for some chronic rheumatic conditions. Hydroxychloroquine, a derivative of CQ first synthesized in 1946, proved to be less toxic (by approximately 40%) when used for longer periods and has been recommended for the treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis.14 During prolonged use (ie, months or even years), which is not the targeted scenario for the treatment of COVID-19, CQ may deposit in the eye, causing retinal toxicity.15,16 Myopathy has also been associated with the use of CQ.17 The major complication, even in short regimens, is the potential for QTc interval prolongation, favoring fatal arrhythmias such as ventricular tachycardia and torsades de pointes.18 The in vitro antiviral activity of CQ was first identified in the late 1960s.19,20 Two studies have shown anti\u2013SARS-CoV activity, with high concentrations needed for antiviral effect.9,11\nThe effect of CQ was apparently superior to the control treatment in inhibiting the exacerbation of pneumonia, improving pulmonary imaging findings, promoting a negative conversion of the virus, and reducing the disease course.12 In 20 patients with COVID-19 treated with HCQ, 6 of whom also received azithromycin, the proportion of patients who tested negative in nasopharyngeal samples differed significantly between patients receiving treatment and patients in the control group.13 Although highly preliminary and probably not sufficiently powered to be conclusive, these results supported an effort to evaluate the effect of CQ on the evolution and prognosis of COVID-19 more thoroughly.\nThe Health Commission of Guangdong Province recommended the use of phosphate CQ tablets at a dose of 500 mg twice daily for 10 days (total dose, 10 g) for the treatment of patients aged 18 to 65 years with mild, moderate, or severe pneumonia secondary to COVID-19.10 A shorter treatment regimen (ie, 5 vs 10 days) could potentially reduce the adverse effects, but the antiviral effect could be lost. Therefore, no clear recommendation of total dosage is available; most recommendations are based on expert opinion.\nConsidering that in many countries the compassionate use of CQ or HCQ to treat COVID-19 has already been formally indicated for patients with severe disease, it would be unethical to test proper efficacy owing to the lack of a placebo group as a comparator. Our study aimed to evaluate primarily the safety and secondarily the efficacy of CQ in 2 different dosages for the treatment of severe COVID-19. Here, we report data from the first 81 randomized patients after an unplanned interim analysis due to safety concerns recommended by the independent data safety and monitoring board (DSMB).\nMethods\nThe detailed study protocol is available in Supplement 1. This study was conducted in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and the Good Clinical Practice guidelines of the International Conference on Harmonization. The protocol was approved by the Brazilian Committee of Ethics in Human Research. All patients and/or legal representatives were informed about objectives and risks of participation. They were given time to carefully read and then sign an informed consent form. After recovery, patients also signed the informed consent form. Random online clinical monitoring and quality control were performed. A virtual independent DSMB, composed of epidemiologists, clinicians, and experts in infectious diseases, was implemented to review the protocol and hold daily meetings to follow the activities of the study. The trial was reported according to the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) reporting guideline.21\nStudy Design and Site\nCloroCovid-19 was a parallel, double-masked, randomized, phase IIb clinical trial, which started on March 23, 2020, aiming to assess the safety and efficacy of CQ in the treatment of hospitalized patients with severe respiratory syndrome secondary to SARS-CoV-2 infection. This trial is being conducted at the Hospital e Pronto-Socorro Delphina Rinaldi Abdel Aziz, in Manaus, Western Brazilian Amazon (currently the largest public unit dedicated exclusively to the treatment of severe COVID-19 cases in Brazil, with the capacity to hospitalize 350 patients in intensive care units). The hospital has all source documents registered online in an electronic medical recording system (Medview). Clinical analyses, laboratory examinations, and routine computed tomography scanning are also available locally. Manaus is the capital of the Amazonas state, the largest Brazilian state, and has approximately 2.5 million inhabitants. At the beginning of the study, autochthonous SARS-CoV-2 transmission had already been recorded at the study site.\nParticipants\nHospitalized patients with clinical suspicion of COVID-19 (ie, history of fever and any respiratory symptom, eg, cough or rhinorrhea), aged 18 years or older at the time of inclusion, with respiratory rate higher than 24 rpm and/or heart rate higher than 125 bpm (in the absence of fever) and/or peripheral oxygen saturation lower than 90% in ambient air and/or shock (ie, arterial pressure lower than 65 mm Hg, with the need for vasopressor medicines, oliguria, or a lower level of consciousness) were included. Patients younger than 18 years were not included due to the known lower morbidity and mortality from COVID-19 in this group.22 Patients were enrolled before laboratory confirmation of COVID-19, considering that this procedure could delay randomization. For the analyses at this point, all patients were included regardless of confirmed etiology, which should not be an issue for the focus of this article, ie, safety concerns. The flow chart (Figure 1) presents clinical-epidemiologic suspected cases as well as cases already confirmed by reverse transcription\u2013polymerase chain reaction.\nSample Size Calculation\nThe sample for the primary outcome (ie, reduction in lethality rate) was calculated assuming a 20% lethality incidence in critically ill patients7,23,24 and that higher dose of CQ would reduce lethality by at least 50% compared with the low-dosage group. Thus, considering a test of differences in proportions between 2 groups of the same size, 80% power and 5% \u03b1, 394 participants were needed (197 per group). Adding 10% for losses, the final sample of 440 participants was obtained. Sample calculation was performed in the R version 3.6.1 (R Project for Statistical Computing), with the functions implemented in the TrialSize and gsDesign packages.\nProcedures\nDosages in the literature are heterogeneous. The reasons that guided the high dosage in this study were as follows: (1) in principle, antiviral dosages should be high, as per in vitro studies\u2019 results9; (2) the toxic effects of high doses, such as HCQ 600 mg twice daily for 28 days, were already studied in patients with cancer, showing good safety even in phase I trials25-27; (3) in an unknown disease that has proved to be more lethal than expected, the benefits for critically ill patients were thought to be superior to the adverse effects of high-dose CQ; (4) only 150 mg chloroquine base tablets are available in Brazil, which needed to be adjusted for a routine daily prescription to avoid tablet partition; (5) patients with high body mass index (calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared) in the study population (ie, median [interquartile range], 28.1 [26.0-31.6]); and (6) critically ill patients in shock usually present limited gastrointestinal absorption, and no intravenous drug was available. The low dosage was what was recommended by the Brazilian Ministry of Health, based on expert opinion.\nThe interventions tested in this study were based on different regimens using CQ base 150 mg tablets (241.9 mg of the phosphate CQ per tablet) (Farmanguinhos). Eligible participants were allocated at a 1:1 ratio to receive orally (or via nasogastric tube in case of orotracheal intubation) either high-dosage CQ (600 mg CQ; 4\u2009\u00d7\u2009150 mg tablets twice daily for 10 days; total dose 12 g) or low-dosage CQ (450 mg CQ; 3\u2009\u00d7\u2009150 mg tablets and 1 placebo tablet twice daily on day 0, 3\u2009\u00d7\u2009150 mg tablets plus 1 placebo tablet once a day followed by 4 placebo tablets from day 1 to day 4, then 4 placebo tablets twice daily from day 5 to day 9; total dose 2.7 g). Placebo tablets, also produced by Farmanguinhos, were used in the low-dosage group to standardize treatment and masking of research team and participants.\nAccording to hospital protocol, all patients meeting the same criteria of the study (ie, acute respiratory distress syndrome) received intravenous ceftriaxone (1 g twice daily for 7 days) plus azithromycin (500 mg once daily for 5 days), systematically, starting on day 0. Oseltamivir (75 mg twice daily for 5 days) was also prescribed when influenza infection was suspected. (In the Amazon, influenza season is from January to April.)\nClinical parameters were measured daily by the routine clinical staff from day 0 to discharge or death, and then at days 13 and 28 for discharged patients, to assess efficacy and safety outcomes. Laboratory parameters and electrocardiograms were performed at the clinician\u2019s discretion. Data were recorded on Medview and then transferred into an electronic database (Research Electronic Data Capture) on tablet computers at bedside in the wards, which were further validated by external trial monitoring staff.\nOutcomes\nSafety outcomes included adverse events that occurred during treatment, serious adverse events, and premature or temporary discontinuation of treatment. Adverse events were classified according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events. The working hypothesis of this trial was that the lethality rate in the high-dosage group would be half that of the low-dosage group by day 28. Thus, the primary end point was lethality by day 28. Secondary end points included lethality on day 13, participant clinical status, laboratory examinations, electrocardiogram on days 13 and 28, daily clinical status during hospitalization, duration of mechanical ventilation (if applicable) and supplementary oxygen (if applicable), and the time (in days) from treatment initiation to death. Here we present analyses until day 13, with lethality as the primary outcome. A subgroup of patients enrolled when already admitted to the intensive care unit was analyzed separately. Virologic measures included viral RNA detection on days 0 and 4.\nRandomization and Masking\nAn electronically generated randomization list was prepared by an independent statistician, with 110 blocks of 4 participants per block. This randomization list was generated on R version 3.6.3 (R Project for Statistical Computing), using the package blockrand. The list was accessible only to nonmasked pharmacists in the study in an attempt to minimize observation bias. Participants were randomized by the study pharmacist to their designated treatment regimen at the time of inclusion and were subsequently identified throughout the study only by their allocated study number, always assigned in chronological order. In case of serious adverse events, unmasking was available to DSMB members, and an unplanned preliminary analysis was performed before the scheduled interim analyses to guide early halting of either group. At this point, an overall lethality rate higher than 25% was noted, and serious cardiac adverse events were reported.\nLaboratory Analysis\nHematology and biochemistry analyses were performed in automatized machines. Samples (2 nasopharyngeal or 1 oropharyngeal swabs) were submitted to viral RNA extraction using QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer\u2019s recommendations. Subsequently, all specimens of potential SARS-CoV-2 were tested using the protocol developed by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, updated on March 15, 2020,28 targeting the virus nucleocapsid (N) gene and the human RNase P gene as an internal control. For all assays, specimens were considered positive if both viral targets (ie, N1 and N2) showed cycle threshold lower than 40.00. No quantitative reverse transcription\u2013polymerase chain reaction data are presented here. Swab specimens were collected on day 0 and day 4. Results were not available to guide any clinical decision because a state-level laboratory (LACEN) centralized the examinations.\nStatistical Analysis\nWe originally planned to perform an interim analysis between the groups when the study reached 25%, 50%, and 75% of the total sample size. However, global lethality (without unmasking) was measured daily for security purposes, and the DSMB was informed accordingly. An intention-to-treat analysis was conducted as part of the primary safety and efficacy analysis. Untaken or mistaken tablets and dosage correction because of renal and liver failure were not registered daily, therefore not allowing for per-protocol analysis. Descriptive statistics were used for demographic, laboratory, and clinical data. To assess the safety of the high and low dosages of CQ, the proportion (and 95% CI) of deaths in each group was compared with the historical proportion (and 95% CI) of deaths in patients who did not use CQ in other countries.7,23,24 For qualitative variables, \u03c72 tests and Fisher exact tests were performed. We used the t test or Mann-Whitney test to compare means and medians. Survival models, using Kaplan-Meier estimate curves, assessed the cumulative proportion of deaths. Log-rank and Peto-Peto (correction for low observation numbers in the end of the follow-up) tests were used for survival time to event analyses. Exploratory multivariate analysis was performed using logistic regression to assess the strength of the association between treatment arm and lethality, adjusted by age. Odds ratios with respective 95% CIs were calculated. Statistical analyses were performed in R version 3.6.1 (R Project for Statistical Computing), and a 2-tailed P\u2009<\u2009.05 was considered significant.\nResults\nPopulation Characteristics\nA total of 81 patients were randomized (40 [49.4%] in the low-dosage group and 41 [50.6%] in the high-dosage group) (Figure 1). A preliminary analysis was performed on April 5, 2020, per DSMB recommendation, when 11 patients had died (7 [63.6%] in the high-dosage group; 4 [36.4%] in the low-dosage group). Most patients (62 of 81 [76.5%]) had COVID-19 confirmed a posteriori by reverse transcription\u2013polymerase chain reaction, with 31 (77.5%) in the low-dosage group and 31 (75.6%) in the high-dosage group. The patients with unconfirmed disease had clinical and epidemiological presentation compatible with COVID-19 and were analyzed together.\nOverall and per-group baseline characteristics are presented in Table 1. Baseline characteristics show an overall mean (SD) age of 51.1 (13.9) years and a predominance of men (60 [75.3%]). Hypertension (25 of 55 [45.5%]), alcohol use disorder (14 of 51 [27.5%]), and diabetes (14 of 55 [25.5%]) were the most frequent comorbidities. Older age (mean [SD] age, 54.7 [13.7] years vs 47.4 [13.3] years) and more heart disease (5 of 28 [17.9%] vs 0) were seen in the high-dose group\nOccurrence of myocarditis (defined as a creatine kinase-MB [CKMB] level more than twice the upper normal limit), which may be a final complication of severe sepsis or a lesion triggered by the virus itself, was seen in 2 of 26 (7.7%) patients (1 patient per group). No echocardiogram was performed. All patients received azithromycin, and the frequency of oseltamivir use was 86.8% (33 of 38) and 92.5% (37 of 40) in the low- and high-dosage groups, respectively.\nSafety Outcomes\nCreatine phosphokinase (CK) and CKMB levels were elevated in 13 of 33 patients (39.4%) and 10 of 26 patients (38.4%), respectively. Considering only confirmed COVID-19 cases, CK and CKMB were elevated in 9 of 25 patients (37.5%) and 7 of 22 patients (31.8%), respectively, and CK increase was more frequent in patients in the high-dosage group than the low-dosage group (7 of 14 [50.0%] vs 6 of 19 [31.6%]). Only 1 patient developed severe rhabdomyolysis, and causality could be attributed to the virus or to CQ, which is already known to cause myolysis (Table 2). Overall 11 of 73 patients (15.1%) had QTc interval corrected by the Fridericia method (QTcF) greater than 500 milliseconds, with 8 of 57 patients (14.0%) with confirmed cases of COVID-19. QTcF greater than 500 milliseconds was more frequent in the high-dosage group than the low-dosage group (7 of 37 [18.9%] vs 4 of 36 [11.1%]). Two of 37 patients (2.7%) in the high-dosage group, both with confirmed COVID-19, experienced ventricular tachycardia before death, without torsade de pointes. This severe type of arrythmia is usually facilitated when QTc interval is prolonged. We did not calculate CQ dose by weight; however, only 1 patient (1.2%) weighed less than 110 lbs. Body mass index was similar in both groups.\nHemoglobin decrease was observed in 11 of 42 patients (26.2%). Creatinine increase was observed in 16 of 38 (42.1%). No apparent differences in hematological or renal toxicity were seen between the groups.\nLethality Outcomes\nOverall lethality rate in our sample was 27.2% (95% CI, 17.9%-38.2%), which overlapped with the 95% CI of the meta-analysis7,23 based on 2 major studies (95% CI, 14.5%-19.2%) that included similar patients not receiving CQ. Survival per group is presented in comparison with historical collation of available data from 2 other similar lethality studies7,23 with patients not receiving CQ (Figure 2A). Lethality was 39.0% (16 of 41 patients) in the high-dosage group and 15.0% (6 of 40) in the low-dosage group. Survival analysis has shown that both groups were similar to historical data, showing no apparent differences despite more deaths in the high-dosage group (log-rank, \u22122.183; P\u2009=\u2009.03). A similar survival analysis excluding 5 patients (6.2%) with chronic cardiac disease was performed, and similar results were found (log-rank, \u22122.188; P\u2009=\u2009.03). Viral RNA was detected in 5 of 6 (83.3%) and 14 of 16 (87.5%) of the dead patients in the low-dosage and high-dosage groups, respectively.\nThe high-dosage group was associated with lethality (odds ratio, 3.6; 95% CI, 1.2-10.6). Despite the small sample size, in an exploratory multivariate analysis, the high-dosage CQ was no longer associated with death when controlled by age (odds ratio, 2.8; 95% CI, 0.9-8.5). In 5 patients with chronic cardiac disease, 3 (60.0%) died; their clinical details are presented in Table 3. Neither ventricular tachycardia nor torsade de pointes was seen in these patients. In the eTable in Supplement 2, we present details of 12 patients with prolonged QTcF and/or ventricular tachycardia. No clear association was seen between the first day of prolonged QTcF and day of death, nor did cumulative dosages seem to be higher among those who died. Overall, 19 of 22 deaths (86.4%) had virologic confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 infection antemortem. Based on these findings, in which a higher dosage of CQ showed the opposite of the study\u2019s hypothesis, the DSMB recommended the immediate interruption of the high-dosage group for all ages and that all patients be unmasked and reverted to the low-dosage group.\nA subgroup was analyzed with critically ill patients enrolled (Figure 2B). No difference in lethality rates was seen between groups.\nA total of 27 patients had nasopharyngeal and/or oropharyngeal samples collected on days 0 and 4. Results were negative on day 4 in only 6 patients (22.2%).\nDiscussion\nIn a unique pandemic situation, health professionals have to choose between offering medical assistance and generating and reporting reliable data, a dichotomy that compromises the ability to generate high-quality evidence for clinical management. However, global recommendations for COVID-19 are being made based on unpowered studies, and because of the chaotic urgency of the situation, drugs are being prescribed in a compassionate manner given the severity of the disease. CQ is a safe drug, used for more than 70 years to treat malaria. However, in the context of patients with severe COVID-19, our study raises enough red flags to stop the use of a high-dosage regimen (ie, 12 g of CQ during 10 days), because the risks of toxic effects overcame the benefits.\nWe were not able to independently assess the toxic role of CQ because all patients were already using azithromycin, as per hospital protocol. Official recommendations from China10 called attention to the nonsimultaneous use of CQ and azithromycin because of potentially synergistic cardiac toxic effects. This combination was also used to treat some patients from Marseille, France, without any concerning safety report.13 Most patients (89.6%) in our study were also receiving oseltamivir for suspected influenza infection, which also increases QTc interval and could have adverse cardiac effects. The data presented here refer to patients in whom CQ, azithromycin, and oseltamivir were concomitantly used because of the atypical circumstances of an unknown disease. Further conclusions on synergistic cardiotoxic effects might be possible with ongoing studies\u2019 results worldwide, as soon as they are presented to the scientific community.\nBy the time of the study planning, the Brazilian regulatory agency and the Brazilian Ministry of Health authorized the compassionate use of CQ and HCQ at the clinician\u2019s discretion, with pressure on physicians to prescribe the drug for patients with severe COVID-19. Although this is not an imperative against running placebo-controlled trials, it triggered an ethical dilemma regarding the conduct of randomized clinical trials offering placebo treatment for patients, strongly influenced by the media favoring CQ use. We also accounted for the fact that the standard of care for severe COVID-19 included CQ in the clinical setting where the trial would be conducted. In the absence of a placebo group, we were compelled to use historical data based on very similar patients not receiving CQ. The lethality rates observed here were not lower; however, we cannot reliably conclude that CQ was of no benefit. Placebo-controlled studies are being performed in countries not routinely using the drug.29 Several ongoing trials (including the CloroCovid-19 II trial30) have also been addressing the early use of CQ, in which the anti-inflammatory properties could potentially be more helpful. That information is urgently needed in well-designed placebo-controlled double-masked randomized trials.\nWe will still enroll patients in the low-dosage group to complete the originally planned sample size. The need for careful follow-up and toxic effect monitoring of patients using the low-dosage regimen in a scenario where CQ is routinely prescribed for severe COVID-19 cases supported this decision. The safety data obtained from the low-dosage group would be extremely useful for designing better guidelines for the rational use of CQ as compassionate treatment for severe COVID-19 until the conclusion of placebo-controlled trials. All the patients remaining in the study were asked to provide updated informed consent, and the informed consent form was properly modified.\nIn addition to helping patients improve, CQ could be used to decrease the viral load in respiratory secretions, allowing less nosocomial and postdischarge transmission. However, our data provided no evidence of such an effect. Patients using CQ (irrespective of dosage) failed to present evidence of substantial viral clearance by day 4, even with the concomitant use of azithromycin.\nNo data exist in the literature showing different cardiotoxic effects between CQ and HCQ; the only concern is with ocular assessment. QTc interval prolongation greater than 500 milliseconds was seen in 11 of 73 patients (15.1%), which is similar to what has been reported in patients with COVID-19 receiving HCQ (11.0%).31 Myopathy has also been associated with CQ use.17 In our study, 1 patient developed rhabdomyolysis, which was attributed to CQ, and the drug was withdrawn. In 2 patients, myocarditis was suspected based on CKMB elevation since the first day of hospitalization, suggesting myocarditis related to SARS-CoV-2 itself. In such cases, drugs prolonging QTc interval could lead to severe arrhythmias. Unfortunately, probably because of the low sample size, this study\u2019s randomization assigned more older patients with heart disease to the high-dosage group than the low-dosage group. Therefore, a limitation for the conclusions of the study on lethality per group is that the high-dosage group included more patients susceptible to cardiac complications, with or without CQ treatment. In any case, use of CQ in older patients, especially those with heart disease, should be conducted with caution. In our sample, the decision to enroll all types of patients in a pragmatic design, whatever age or comorbidity, was based on the formerly predicted high lethality among critically ill patients with COVID-19, and an imprecise risk-benefit of CQ was assumed at the time of the protocol design. In view of the results, it is clear that any CQ treatment or protocol design for severe COVID-19 should include previous QTc interval evaluation, close daily monitoring, and dosage modification when needed.\nLethality among critically ill patients in the present study seemed to be even higher than among similar patients not receiving CQ in a large historical sample-size cohort of patients in Lombardy, Italy.24 That could reflect the quality of intensive care units in both countries or the possible lack of or deleterious effect of CQ in such patients with COVID-19. The occurrence of myocarditis in our sample, with the confirmed QTcF prolongation, warrants caution regarding this drug\u2019s safety, particularly considering the eventual increase in fatal arrythmias, such as ventricular tachycardia.\nStrengths and Limitations\nThis study had some strengths. It was double-masked; performed in a public hospital, which will manage most cases in countries like Brazil; compliant with good clinical practices, with a vigilant and highly involved DSMB; and presented an assessment of 2 dosages of CQ for the first time in patients with severe COVID-19. However, this study has limitations, including its small sample size; its single-center design; its lack of a placebo control group; and the absence of exclusion criteria based on the QTc interval at baseline.\nPer-protocol analysis was not performed because of the impossibility of monitoring drug administration twice a day at the hospital. Radiologic findings were presented in this article only at the baseline due to the inability to perform careful analyses of available computed tomography scans over time. Radiologic and complete efficacy data will be presented later.\nConclusions\nIn this study, a high-dosage of CQ (12 g) given for 10 days concurrently with azithromycin and oseltamivir was not sufficiently safe to warrant continuation of that study group. Age was an important confounder and might be associated with the unfavorable outcomes. We recommend that similar dosages no longer be used for the treatment of severe COVID-19, especially because treatment based on older patients with previous cardiac diseases who are receiving concomitant cardiotoxic drugs should be the rule. No apparent benefit of CQ was seen regarding lethality in our patients so far. To better understand the role of CQ or HCQ in the treatment of COVID-19, we recommend the following next steps: (1) randomized clinical trials evaluating its role as a prophylactic drug and (2) randomized clinical trials evaluating its efficacy against the progression of COVID-19 when administered to patients with mild or moderate disease. Even if we fail to generate good evidence in time to control the current pandemic, the information will affect how we deal with coronavirus outbreaks in the future.\nBack to top\nArticle Information\nAccepted for Publication: April 20, 2020.\nPublished: April 24, 2020. doi:10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2020.8857\nOpen Access: This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the CC-BY License. \u00a9 2020 Borba MGS et al.

There are currently no effective therapies to prevent, treat, or cure COVID-19. To meet this need, the scientific community has mobilized to develop vaccines and drugs to prevent and treat COVID-19. Trials are underway to assess the effectiveness of existing drugs that hold promise in treating COVID-19. While the results of these trials are eagerly awaited, the US Food and Drug Administration recently authorized use of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine for emergency treatment of COVID-19.\nIn the US, chloroquine is used predominantly to treat infectious diseases, such as malaria. Its less-toxic metabolite, hydroxychloroquine, is prescribed for lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, and other autoimmune diseases. Indeed, hydroxychloroquine has long been a mainstay of lupus treatment, and it is the only drug shown to prevent progression to serious end-organ damage.\nLupus is a complex autoimmune disease that predominantly affects young women.1 The prevalence of lupus is higher and the severity greater among individuals from lower socioeconomic strata, African Americans, Hispanic Americans, and Asian Americans. Clinical features range from mild joint and skin involvement to life-threatening renal, hematologic, and/or central nervous system disease. Half of patients with lupus develop nephritis, the most common cause of morbidity and mortality. Patients with lupus who are impoverished and/or members of racial/ethnic minorities experience worse outcomes and increased mortality.1\nHydroxychloroquine is recommended for all patients with lupus, especially those with no contraindication such as pregnancy. It relieves constitutional, musculoskeletal, and mucocutaneous manifestations and decreases thrombotic events, organ damage, and mortality. Hydroxychloroquine helps maintain disease remission and prevent flares. Among patients with lupus that is not organ threatening, 80% achieve remission with hydroxychloroquine and may sustain it with this therapy for long periods.2\nAlthough there is no rigorous scientific evidence supporting the use of hydroxychloroquine in COVID-19 as of early April 2020, consumers are stockpiling the drug not only for treatment but also prophylaxis prompted by media reports of possible efficacy. A rationale for hydroxychloroquine use in COVID-19 is based on in vitro studies showing that chloroquine inhibits virus replication.3 Because hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine may have in vivo antiviral and anti-inflammatory effects, they offer a potential means to mitigate COVID-19.\nA recent small (n\u2009=\u200936), open-label nonrandomized trial in France suggested that therapy with hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin decreased viral load and replication,4 garnering significant media attention. However, randomized clinical trials are required to assess the efficacy and safety of hydroxychloroquine as prophylaxis or treatment for COVID-19. The FDA has authorized its use for treatment of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 but not for prophylaxis. President Trump has touted hydroxychloroquine therapy, despite very limited evidence of efficacy.5,6\nSince being prominently featured in the press and on social media as a potential COVID-19 therapy, demand for hydroxychloroquine has exploded and a shortage has ensued. Some physicians are prescribing it for prophylaxis as well as outpatient treatment of COVID-19, often along with azithromycin. Some health care workers are taking it as prophylaxis without any evidence to support this use.\nHowever, if these uses of hydroxychloroquine to prevent and treat COVID-19 cause pharmacies to develop shortages of this drug, patients with lupus will find it difficult, if not impossible, to fill their routine hydroxychloroquine prescriptions. The American Society of Health-System Pharmacists has already confirmed shortages of hydroxychloroquine. Prior to COVID-19, many patients with lupus who have low incomes or limited prescription drug coverage found it difficult to pay for a 90-day supply and thus relied on monthly refills. Without their hydroxychloroquine refills, many will experience flare-ups and may develop irreversible organ damage.7\nThe potential misuse of hydroxychloroquine during the COVID-19 pandemic poses serious risks to patients with lupus who are socioeconomically vulnerable. Pharmacy shortages could lead to a black market for the drug, rendering it unaffordable for many patients with lupus. A black market for unsafe, counterfeit hydroxychloroquine could develop. Expedited FDA approval of hydroxychloroquine for COVID-19 could lead to a scenario similar to colchicine rebranding. In that case, the FDA granted exclusive rights to a single company to market the medication for all indications, and prices immediately increased nearly 30-fold. For patients with lupus, widespread unemployment, decreased financial resources, and loss of employer-sponsored insurance resulting from COVID-19 may make hydroxychloroquine unaffordable, even if it is available.\nAlthough large pharmaceutical companies have committed to produce ample supplies of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, their timeline is uncertain, and these threats remain. As we have learned from consumer behavior with toilet paper, hand sanitizers, and masks during the COVID-19 crisis, even as the supply of hydroxychloroquine increases, barriers for patients with lupus who are vulnerable may persist. Stockpiling of hydroxychloroquine to prevent or treat COVID-19, despite very limited evidence of benefit, thus exposes these patients to enormous risks.\nMaintaining remission in patients with lupus who are immunosuppressed is particularly important, given their increased vulnerability to COVID-19 and its most severe complications. Patients with lupus flare-ups will likely need systemic glucocorticoids or other immunosuppressive medications, further increasing their risk of infection and transmission of COVID-19 to others. Physicians must therefore prescribe hydroxychloroquine responsibly, if at all, when treating patients with COVID-19. Furthermore, policymakers should develop regulations to preserve access to an adequate supply of this lifesaving medication for patients with lupus and other autoimmune diseases.\nArticle Information\nCorresponding author: Bella Mehta, MBBS, MS, Hospital for Special Surgery, 535 E. 70th Street, New York, NY 10021 (drbellamehta@gmail.com).\nConflict of Interest Disclosures: None reported.\nReferences\n1.\nCarter  EE\ufeff , Barr  SG\ufeff , Clarke  AE\ufeff .

The latest data available (2018) show the highest age-adjusted suicide rate in the US since 1941.1 It is within this context that coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) struck the US. Concerning disease models have led to historic and unprecedented public health actions to curb the spread of the virus. Remarkable social distancing interventions have been implemented to fundamentally reduce human contact. While these steps are expected to reduce the rate of new infections, the potential for adverse outcomes on suicide risk is high. Actions could be taken to mitigate potential unintended consequences on suicide prevention efforts, which also represent a national public health priority.\nCOVID-19 Public Health Interventions and Suicide Risk\nSecondary consequences of social distancing may increase the risk of suicide. It is important to consider changes in a variety of economic, psychosocial, and health-associated risk factors.\nEconomic Stress\nThere are fears that the combination of canceled public events, closed businesses, and shelter-in-place strategies will lead to a recession. Economic downturns are usually associated with higher suicide rates compared with periods of relative prosperity.2 Since the COVID-19 crisis, businesses have faced adversity and laying off employees. Schools have been closed for indeterminable periods, forcing some parents and guardians to take time off work. The stock market has experienced historic drops, resulting in significant changes in retirement funds. Existing research suggests that sustained economic stress could be associated with higher US suicide rates in the future.\nSocial Isolation\nLeading theories of suicide emphasize the key role that social connections play in suicide prevention. Individuals experiencing suicidal ideation may lack connections to other people and often disconnect from others as suicide risk rises.3 Suicidal thoughts and behaviors are associated with social isolation and loneliness.3 Therefore, from a suicide prevention perspective, it is concerning that the most critical public health strategy for the COVID-19 crisis is social distancing. Furthermore, family and friends remain isolated from individuals who are hospitalized, even when their deaths are imminent. To the extent that these strategies increase social isolation and loneliness, they may increase suicide risk.\nDecreased Access to Community and Religious Support\nMany Americans attend various community or religious activities. Weekly attendance at religious services has been associated with a 5-fold lower suicide rate compared with those who do not attend.4 The effects of closing churches and community centers may further contribute to social isolation and hence suicide.\nBarriers to Mental Health Treatment\nHealth care facilities are adding COVID-19 screening questions at entry points. At some facilities, children and other family members (without an appointment) are not permitted entry. Such actions may create barriers to mental health treatment (eg, canceled appointments associated with child restrictions while school is canceled). Information in the media may also imply that mental health services are not prioritized at this time (eg, portrayals of overwhelmed health care settings, canceled elective surgeries). Moreover, overcrowded emergency departments may negatively affect services for survivors of suicide attempts. Reduced access to mental health care could negatively affect patients with suicidal ideation.\nIllness and Medical Problems\nExacerbated physical health problems could increase risk for some patients, especially among older adults, in whom health problems are associated with suicide. One patient illustrated the psychological toll of COVID-19 symptoms when he told his clinician, \u201c'I feel like (you) sent me home to die.\u201d5\nOutcomes of National Anxiety\nIt is possible that the 24/7 news coverage of these unprecedented events could serve as an additional stressor, especially for individuals with preexisting mental health problems. The outcomes of national anxiety on an individual\u2019s depression, anxiety, and substance use deserve additional study.\nHealth Care Professional Suicide Rates\nMany studies document elevated suicide rates among medical professionals.6 This at-risk group is now serving in the front lines of the battle against COVID-19. A national discussion is emerging about health care workers\u2019 concerns about infection, exposure of family members, sick colleagues, shortages of necessary personal protective equipment, overwhelmed facilities, and work stress. This special population deserves support and prevention services.\nFirearm Sales\nMany news outlets have reported a surge in US gun sales as COVID-19 advances. Firearms are the most common method of suicide in the US, and firearm ownership or access and unsafe storage are associated with elevated suicide risk.7 In this context, issues of firearm safety for suicide prevention are increasingly relevant.\nSeasonal Variation in Rates\nIn the northern hemisphere, suicide rates tend to peak in the late spring and early summer. The fact that this will probably coincide with peak COVID-19 prevention efforts is concerning and deserves additional study.\nSuicide Prevention Opportunities\nDespite challenges, there are opportunities to improve suicide prevention efforts in this unique time. Maintenance of some existing efforts is also possible.\nPhysical Distance, Not Social Distance\nDespite its name, social distancing requires physical space between people, not social distance. Efforts can be made to stay connected and maintain meaningful relationships by telephone or video, especially among individuals with substantial risk factors for suicide. Social media solutions can be explored to facilitate these goals.\nTele\u2013Mental Health\nThere is national momentum to increase the use of telehealth in response to COVID-19. Unfortunately, tele\u2013mental health treatments for individuals with suicidal ideation have lagged far behind the telehealth field. Opportunities to increase the use of evidence-based treatments for individuals with suicidal thoughts have been noted for years, especially in rural settings, but fear of adverse events and lawsuits have paralyzed the field. Disparities in computer and high-speed internet access must also be addressed. Research, culture change, and potentially even legislative protections are needed to facilitate delivery of suicide prevention treatments to individuals who will otherwise receive nothing.\nIncrease Access to Mental Health Care\nAs COVID-19 precautions develop in health care settings, it is essential to consider the management of individuals with mental health crises. Screening and prevention procedures for COVID-19 that might reduce access to care (eg, canceled appointments, sending patients home) could include screening for mental health crises; clinical staff would be needed to some degree in settings that may currently relegate COVID-19 symptom screening to administrative staff. Also, rather than sending a patient with a child home, alternative treatment settings could be considered (eg, a private space outside).\nDistance-Based Suicide Prevention\nThere are evidence-based suicide prevention interventions that were designed to be delivered remotely. For example, some brief contact interventions (telephone-based outreach)8 and the Caring Letters intervention (in which letters are sent through the mail)9 have reduced suicide rates in randomized clinical trials. Follow-up contact may be especially important for individuals who are positive for COVID-19 and have suicide risk factors.\nMedia Reporting\nBecause of suicide contagion, media reports on this topic should follow reporting guidelines and include the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline (1-800-273-TALK). The hotline remains open.\nOptimistic Considerations\nThere may be a silver lining to the current situation. Suicide rates have declined in the period after past national disasters (eg, the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks). One hypothesis is the so-called pulling-together effect, whereby individuals undergoing a shared experience might support one another, thus strengthening social connectedness. Recent advancements in technology (eg, video conferencing) might facilitate pulling together. Epidemics and pandemics may also alter one\u2019s views on health and mortality, making life more precious, death more fearsome, and suicide less likely.\nConclusions\nConcerns about negative secondary outcomes of COVID-19 prevention efforts should not be taken to imply that these public health actions should not be taken. However, implementation should include a comprehensive approach that considers multiple US public health priorities, including suicide prevention. There are opportunities to enhance suicide prevention services during this crisis.\nBack to top\nArticle Information\nCorresponding Author: Mark A.

As a pediatric oncologist who studies resilience in the context of illness, I started thinking about what this pandemic means for our professional resilience a few weeks ago, when the first US patient with fatal COVID-19 died in my home city of Seattle, Washington.\nPromoting resilience among health care workers and organizations starts with understanding what resilience is (and what it is not). Historical psychology and social science suggested resilience was either a trait (eg, hardiness), a process (eg, adaptation), or an outcome (eg, the absence of posttraumatic stress or the presence of posttraumatic growth after a particular adversity).1 The first and last conceptualizations are questionable. The potential for resilience is not a unique trait that one has or does not have; the capacity for resilience is inherent in all people. Resilience is not a single dichotomous outcome measured at a point; we can simultaneously experience posttraumatic stress and growth, and these (and other) outcomes dynamically evolve throughout our lives. Finally, both trait and outcome conceptualizations suggest resilience is something that happens to the fortunate and something we can hope for but not necessarily achieve. This is incorrect. Resilience is neither lucky nor passive. It takes deliberate effort. Indeed, while resilience researchers have quibbled over nuanced definitions and requirements for resilience, they agree that it can be strengthened with practice.1\nModern psychology and social science define resilience as \u201cthe process of adapting well in the face of adversity, trauma, tragedy, threats or significant sources of stress.\u201d1,2 For years, I questioned the qualification of the word well. Who defines wellness, and what is well enough to meet the threshold of resilience? My questioning stemmed from a conversation I had years ago with a parent who was bereaved. They said they were resilient because they had gotten out of bed that day, because they were putting one foot in front of the other and continuing the hard work of living without their son. I thought, \u201cYeah. That seems pretty resilient. I\u2019m not sure I would be able to do the same.\u201d I concluded that resilience was about adapting\u2014the wellness part was optional.\nTime and observation have forced me to reconsider that conclusion. Certainly, getting out of bed and putting one foot in front of the other is part of the resilience process. But it is not the whole story. If I were to learn that the same parent was still defining their resilience by getting out of bed without some additional forward progress, I would worry. Day-to-day subsisting without wellness is not resilience; it is a failure to thrive. I would wish more for them.\nMost people do get to experience more. When they get far enough past an adversity to look back with perspective, they appraise it. They consider its effects on their lives and identities, and (sometimes only with prompting) they reflect on the skills they leveraged or developed, the actions they took, the lessons they learned, and the reasons they kept (or keep) going. The parent who was bereaved and got out of bed each day, for example, recently shared with me that they now endeavor to live their life to the fullest because their son cannot.\nWhat does this mean for us as individuals and organizations in the era of COVID-19? It means we need to be deliberate about navigating the middle of the resilience process, the part between getting through and looking back. Communities and individuals facing adversities as diverse as war, famine, poverty, illness, or death do this by harnessing consistent categories of resilience resources.1,3 Which resources work for whom is highly contextual and based on culture, community, and individual needs. Naming the categories and examples of their corresponding, specific resilience resources helps us identify and harness them.\nCategories of resilience resources are individual (eg, personal characteristics and skills), community (eg, social supports and sense of connection), and existential (eg, sense of meaning and purpose; Table). In the context of COVID-19, these apply to both health care professionals and organizations. For example, an individual resilience resource is the ability to successfully set goals, often by identifying and mapping specific, measurable, and realistic steps toward their achievement. For professionals, this may involve the deliberate creation of short-term goals for working from home or for self-care after a stressful day on the hospital ward. For organizations, this may involve deliberately celebrating systems-level steps toward shared community goals, such as evidence that local social distancing practices are beginning to flatten the curve.\nTable.  Evidence-Based Categories of Resilience Resources and Possible Applications in the Era of Coronavirus Disease 2019\nView LargeDownload\nCommunity resilience resources for both professionals and whole organizations may involve deliberate efforts to maintain connections via frequent video conferences and communication of COVID-19 policies and their implications (Table). Finally, to cultivate an existential resilience resource, such as the sense of meaning and purpose, professionals and organizations might deliberately consider the value of their contributions; appreciate experiences, people, and things for which they are grateful; or ground themselves by recalling their missions to help vulnerable populations.\nThe process of resilience requires these deliberate actions. It is complicated and contextual. It is promotable. The pandemic of COVID-19 has already shown us how dramatically and quickly our world can shift in its approach to population health and individual patient needs. Many of us, as individuals and organizations, are in the beginning phase\u2014the getting-through phase, the one-foot-in-front-of-the-other phase. We can only imagine the end phase, the looking-back phase. We cannot guess exactly what we will have learned. We can only know that none of us will forget.\nSo, let us now be proactive. Let us imagine our future narrative and direct ourselves toward its end. Let us harness our individual, community, and existential resources so that we not only navigate this experience but also continue to thrive. Let us ensure that when we look back on this story, we will be able to say we adapted well.\nBack to top\nArticle Information\nCorresponding Author: Abby R.

Among the measures intended to promote social distancing, many schools have been closed and classes shifted to home-based distance-learning models. The first school closures began in mid-March 2020 and some states have already closed schools for the rest of the academic year. Nearly all of the 55 million students in kindergarten through 12th grade in the US are affected by these closures. School closures substantially disrupt the lives of students and their families and may have consequences for child health. As such, we must consider the potential associations school closures have with children\u2019s well-being and what can be done to mitigate them.\nChildren and adolescents are generally healthy and do not require much health care outside of regular checkups and immunizations. However, mental health care is very important for children and adolescents. Most mental health disorders begin in childhood, making it essential that mental health needs are identified early and treated during this sensitive time in child development.1 If untreated, mental health problems can lead to many negative health and social outcomes.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic may worsen existing mental health problems and lead to more cases among children and adolescents because of the unique combination of the public health crisis, social isolation, and economic recession. Economic downturns are associated with increased mental health problems for youth that may be affected by the ways that economic downturns affect adult unemployment, adult mental health, and child maltreatment.2\nEducators, administrators, and policy makers must minimize the disruptions that school closures will have on academic development. Schools offer many other critical services to students outside of education. For example, schools are a major source of nutrition for many students, and ensuring food security has been a common component of school closure plans. However, other services are equally essential to children\u2019s health and must be addressed.\nOne potentially overlooked role played by schools is the delivery of health care, and especially of mental health services. Schools have long served as a de facto mental health system for many children and adolescents.3 Data from the nationally representative National Survey of Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) include information on mental health services for children age 12 to 17 years and illustrate the implications of school closures on access to mental health services.\nAn analysis of the 2014 NSDUH by found that 13.2% of adolescents received some sort of mental health services from a school setting in the past 12 months, corresponding to 3 million adolescents.4 This includes a mix of adolescents who attend a regular school and receive services from a mental health clinician there and adolescents who attend a special school or a special program at a regular school for behavioral or emotional problems. An analysis of the 2012 to 2015 NSDUH found that among all adolescents who used any mental health services in the year, 57% received some school-based mental health services.5\nFurthermore, among adolescents who received any mental health services during 2012 to 2015, 35% received their mental health services exclusively from school settings.5 School closures will be especially disruptive for the mental health services of that group. It is important to also understand that school closures will be relatively more disruptive for the mental health care of some youths. Adolescents in racial and ethnic minority groups, with lower family income, or with public health insurance were disproportionately likely to receive mental health services exclusively from school settings.5 These students may lack the family resources and existing relationships with clinicians to quickly gain access to alternative community-based services. Policy makers should consider responses to address COVID-19\u2019s short-term disruptions for children\u2019s mental health services while also laying groundwork to improve children\u2019s mental health services in the long term.\nFacilitating Technology-Enabled Modalities That Expand, Extend, and Sometimes Replace Traditional Face-to-Face Encounters\nTelemental health services are shown to be similarly effective as in-person services.6 Not all school-based clinicians and not all families have the technology needed to implement this as a comprehensive immediate solution, but when possible, it can help in the short term. However, close attention must be paid to not exacerbate inequities in access to care. In the long term, policy, financing, and delivery reform can help expand these modalities and reduce the existing barriers to timely mental health care. Options include adopting Medicaid policies that deem all patient and client contact equivalent and guaranteeing full-cost reimbursement for telemental health services as not to diminish the needed workforce during a crisis. If school-based and other in-person mental health services are inaccessible to children and adolescents, it highlights the potential value for other technology-enabled interventions. Although there is limited effectiveness of mobile mental health apps for adolescents currently, this is an area in which innovative technologies could fill a substantial gap if demonstrated to be effective.\nAddressing Privacy Concerns\nThe US Department of Health and Human Services has allowed for a limited waiver to loosen Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) rules in response to COVID-19. This means that tools that had not been HIPAA compliant (eg, Facetime [Apple]) are now available to clinicians for evaluation and treatment. This temporary change may be instructive for whether HIPAA regulations might be rebalanced in the longer term if the relaxed rules improve access to care. Other privacy restrictions might be reconsidered, even temporarily. For example, the US Federal Educational Rights and Privacy Act disallows disclosure of identifiable information from education records. This may be a barrier to coordinated care for students who now must receive services outside of school but whose clinicians are unaware of relevant information that the school may possess. In addition to privacy regulation, clinicians should be mindful that other privacy considerations may hinder the use of telemental health services. With physical distancing recommendations in place, some youth may be unable to access telemental health services in a private setting away from parents and siblings. This barrier may be especially important for lower-income families with smaller living spaces.\nCoordination With Community Mental Health\nThe Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services and Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration have issued guidance to states about what state Medicaid programs can do to increase and improve the delivery of mental health services in schools.7 One model involves schools coordinating with community mental health agencies to deliver services within schools. This model can allow students to engage with those service clinicians even outside of school settings, which is particularly advantageous during a school closing but can also help encourage continuity of care more broadly. Medicaid is the largest funder of mental health services in the US, and states can submit State Plan Amendments to provide federal financing for this model of services, which can enhance the financial viability of this mode, and mental health services for students more broadly.\nCOVID-19 will have major repercussions for children and adolescents\u2019 health and well-being. Timely action can help lessen the effects and improve long-term capacities for mental health services.\nBack to top\nArticle Information\nCorresponding Author: Ezra Golberstein, PhD, University of Minnesota School of Public Health, Division of Health Policy and Management, 420 Delaware St, SE, MMC 729, Minneapolis, MN 55455 (egolber@umn.edu).\nPublished Online: April 14, 2020. doi:10.1001/jamapediatrics.2020.1456\nConflict of Interest Disclosures: None reported.\nReferences\n1.\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention.

Reports associated with children are growing but still scarce.1-3 The epicenter of the epidemic has displaced to Europe. The first case in Spain was declared on January 31, 2020, and the first case in the Madrid region was declared on February 27, 2020.\nMethods\nWith the aim of obtaining an overview of the proportion of confirmed cases among those tested and the severity of the disease in children, a registry of tested cases was performed from March 2, 2020, to March 16, 2020, by pediatricians in 30 secondary and tertiary hospitals in Madrid, Spain, during the first 2 weeks of the epidemic. Children were screened according to Spanish Public Health recommendations, which included those patients with a significant disease who were admitted, or likely to be admitted, at the time of evaluation according to the attending pediatrician or patients with signs or symptoms compatible with COVID-19 and the risk of complications due to baseline disease. This study was approved by the ethics committee of Hospital 12 de Octubre. Data collection was allowed by verbal consent with subsequent written consent provided by patients with positive results. Data were deidentified. The test used for diagnosis was real-time polymerase chain reaction.4 The reported sensitivities for the E gene and RdRp gene assays are 5.2 and 3.8 copies per reaction at 95% detection probability, respectively.4 Both genes needed to be amplified to report a positive result.\nResults\nDuring the first 2 weeks of the epidemic in Madrid, Spain, 365 children were screened within the 30 hospitals. During the first week, 6 of 103 patients (5.8%) had positive test results. At the end of the second week, 41 of 365 patients (11.2%) had positive test results (Table). By March 16, 2020, 41 of the 4695 confirmed cases (0.8%) in Madrid region were children younger than 18 years.\nThe median age of the tested patients was 3 years (interquartile range, 0.9-6 years; range, 0-15 years) and the median age of the patients with positive results was 1 year (interquartile range, 0.35-8.5 years; range 0-15 years). Twenty five of 41 children with confirmed COVID-19 (60%) were hospitalized, 4 of 41 (9.7%) were admitted to a pediatric intensive care unit (PICU), and 4 of 41 (9.7%) needed respiratory support beyond nasal prongs (Table). Of these, 1 of 4 (25%) had only 1 previous condition (recurrent wheezing). No patients died. Initial syndromic diagnoses were upper respiratory tract infection (14 [34%]), fever without a source (11 [27%]), viral-like pneumonia (6 [15%]), bronchiolitis (5 [12%]), gastroenteritis or vomiting (2 [5%]), bacterial-like pneumonia (2 [5%]), and asthma flare (1 [2%]). Two patients (5%) had a coinfection with influenza B.\nDiscussion\nOur series agrees with those previously published, suggesting that only 2% of affected individuals are younger than 19 years.1 In Madrid, 60% of confirmed infections in children required admission. The usual criteria for admission in our region because of respiratory problems coincide with the definition of severe disease in China. Only 21 of 731 children with confirmed COVID-19 (2.8%) in China had severe disease (hypoxia and oxygen saturation less than 92%) or critical disease.5\nThe key issue regarding the high percentage of admissions is the number of children tested. Initially, only children with contact with a person with COVID-19 were tested, but the situation changed rapidly. From March 9, 2020, onwards, Madrid was declared an area of community transmission. Afterwards, the recommendation was to test only hospitalized children with symptoms and signs of COVID-19 or patients with comorbidities and a high risk of complications. Some children at risk of hospitalization were also tested, although they were ultimately discharged. In other settings, several children with mild disease were tested and the proportion of admissions was lower.1 Therefore, testing may have been biased to moderate to severe patients, and results must be interpreted with caution. Other reasons for the different proportion of hospitalizations, PICU admissions, and respiratory support may be associated with an increased awareness of COVID-19, different criteria for hospitalization and initiation of high-flow oxygen therapy, or different host responses to the infection.\nLimitations\nOne limitation of this study is the sensitivity of the test. Some authors state that pharyngeal and nasal swab sensitivity is as low as 32% to 63%.6 Although the sensitivity and specificity of the polymerase chain reaction may have improved, the actual number of children with infection may be higher.\nConclusions\nInfections in children occur early in COVID-19 epidemics. The proportion of confirmed patients among those with compatible symptoms was 11%. Severe infections may occur, needing PICU admission or high-flow ventilation. Further information is warranted to shape the features of this disease in children.\nBack to top\nArticle Information\nCorresponding Author: Alfredo Tagarro, PhD, MD, Servicio de Pediatr\u00eda, Hospital Infanta Sof\u00eda de San Sebasti\u00e1n de los Reyes, Madrid, Spain (alfredotagarro@gmail.com).\nPublished Online: April 8, 2020. doi:10.1001/jamapediatrics.2020.1346\nAuthor Contributions: Dr Tagarro had full access to all the data in the study and takes responsibility for the integrity of the data and the accuracy of the data analysis.\nConcept and design: Tagarro, Moraleda, Calvo.\nAcquisition, analysis, or interpretation of data: All authors.\nDrafting of the manuscript: Tagarro, Moraleda, Calvo.\nCritical revision of the manuscript for important intellectual content: All authors.\nStatistical analysis: Tagarro.\nAdministrative, technical, or material support: Epalza, Moraleda.\nSupervision: Tagarro, Epalza, Sanz-Santaeufemia, Moraleda, Calvo.\nConflict of Interest Disclosures: Dr Epalza reported consulting fees from Viiv and a scientific travel grant from Gilead outside the submitted work.

A man in his 50s who received dialysis treatments at a Northwest Kidney Centers facility in Seattle was the first person with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) to die in the United States.\nWatnick, the nonprofit dialysis organization\u2019s chief medical officer, immediately called Elizabeth McNamara, RN, vice president of patient care services and chief nursing officer. The patient had last undergone dialysis at one of Northwest Kidney Centers\u2019 19 sites a week earlier.\nAJPhoto/sciencesource.com\nThat center wasn\u2019t open on Saturdays, \u201cso we had a bit of time to decide what to do,\u201d Watnick recalled in an interview a few weeks later. \u201cWe brought in a group to disinfect the facility head to toe.\u201d They also made lists of patients who had dialyzed next to the man when he could have been infectious and staff who had come in contact with him at the dialysis center and in the hospital where he was treated for COVID-19. All were told to self-quarantine for 14 days, with 1 exception: The patients needed to continue coming into the dialysis center for treatment.\nBy the time the facility opened for business early Sunday morning, Northwest Kidney Centers had developed a patient handout about COVID-19. In addition to distributing the handout, \u201cwe sat chairside, one-on-one, to explain what had happened,\u201d Watnick said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t want to spread fear and have patients not come.\u201d\nThat night, 10 members of the COVID-19 response team from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), which includes clinicians, epidemiologists, and data scientists, arrived in Seattle, at the time the epicenter of the US COVID-19 outbreak. Two of them were deployed to Northwest Kidney Centers.\nAlso that night, Watnick said, she and her team learned that a second person in the US with COVID-19 had died. That individual, who resided in a nursing home with an outbreak, had been treated at the same dialysis center as the first person to die, albeit on different days and a different shift.\nNorthwest Kidney Centers updated its patient handout twice in the first 3 weeks as more became known about the novel coronavirus that causes COVID-19.\n\u201cWe have moved forward with 3 guiding principles: We have an obligation to provide dialysis, we are going to follow science, and we are going to provide leadership and support to all of our patients,\u201d said Watnick, who recently coauthored an article with McNamara describing their response\u2014disbelief at first\u2014to the news that the first US COVID-19 death was one of their patients.\nA High-Risk Group\nBy the end of 2017, the most recent year for which data are available, approximately 750 000 people in the United States had end-stage renal disease (ESRD), and nearly half a million of them were being treated with hemodialysis, according to the US Renal Data System (USRDS), which is funded by the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases.\nSimply having ESRD puts people at an increased risk of severe COVID-19, and many people with kidney failure are older and have additional risk factors such as diabetes and heart disease. But the vast majority of individuals who require maintenance hemodialysis can\u2019t wait out the pandemic by continuously sheltering in place. They must spend 3 to 5 hours at a dialysis center 3 days a week, where, typically, rows of machines dialyze many patients at once.\nDetroit nephrologist Joel Topf, MD, said he met with all 70 of his dialysis patients during the last full week of March, and every single one wanted to talk about COVID-19. \u201cPeople seemed appropriately nervous, but fine,\u201d Topf said in an interview.\nThree out of 10 people with ESRD in 2017 had received a kidney transplant by the end of the year, according to the USRDS. However, that proportion could decline during the pandemic and lead to increased demand for in-center dialysis.\nThe Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), which oversees the Medicare End Stage Renal Disease Program, the national insurance program for people with ESRD, has deemed transplants to be nonelective surgery that shouldn\u2019t be deferred because of the pandemic. However, many kidney transplants likely are being postponed, according to Michael Spigler, vice president of patient services and kidney disease education at the American Kidney Fund.\n\u201cMany of the centers in the country have stopped or significantly reduced the number of transplants that they\u2019re doing,\u201d Spigler said in a video posted March 30, in which he cited a shortage of beds and personal protective equipment. \u201cMany, many programs have stopped living donor transplants almost completely\u2026. Deceased donations are continuing pretty well so far\u2026but it\u2019s almost inevitable that we\u2019re going to see those start to drop soon as well.\u201d\nMinimizing Exposure\nAs of early April, no documented cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) transmission within US dialysis centers had been reported, and the facilities had implemented a number of safety measures to reduce the chance of that happening.\nHowever, dialysis centers weren\u2019t designed with a highly infectious virus such as SARS-CoV-2 in mind.\n\u201cSome dialysis units have nothing but a big open room with people sitting around in it,\u201d said Alan Kliger, MD, chair of Nephrologists Transforming Dialysis Safety (NTDS), a partnership between the CDC and the American Society of Nephrology (ASN) whose goal is to eliminate preventable infections in dialysis units. When the NTDS was launched in 2016, its focus was on hepatitis B, influenza, and Clostridioides difficile infections.\nKliger, a clinical professor of medicine at Yale, noted that his dialysis unit has an isolation room used mainly for patients with hepatitis B, as well as 2 other rooms for patients who need privacy for emotional or physical reasons, such as a gastrointestinal infection.\n\u201cIsolation in dialysis units is less than ideal,\u201d said Jeffrey Silberzweig, MD, cochair of the ASN Emergency Partnership Initiative and chief medical officer of the Rogosin Institute, a New York City nonprofit with 9 dialysis centers that also focuses on kidney disease research and prevention. \u201cWe don\u2019t have the facilities to truly isolate patients who are COVID-19 positive,\u201d he noted in an interview, adding that one Rogosin dialysis center has no separate treatment room at all.\n\u201cObviously, we\u2019re afraid,\u201d Silberzweig said. \u201cOur approach is to try to narrow the exposure as best we can.\u201d\nHe and Kliger, along with CDC physicians, infectious disease specialists, and dialysis nurses, serve on the ASN COVID-19 Response Team, which has published a list of regularly updated frequently asked questions based on current CDC guidance. The 2 nephrologists recently published an article about how dialysis facilities can mitigate the risk of COVID-19.\nDialysis facilities should instruct patients with symptoms or contact with an infected person to call ahead to allow for proper preparation, Kliger and Silberzweig wrote. The centers should also screen every person entering by asking about symptoms or possible exposures.\nThose who answer yes to any of the questions should wear a face mask and be directed to a room away from the general waiting area. If separate rooms are available, patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 can be treated behind closed doors. If a separate room isn\u2019t available, dialysis centers should consider treating such patients during the same shift or, if necessary, in a designated COVID-19 facility. If patients with COVID-19 symptoms must be treated at the same time as those without symptoms, they should dialyze in a corner or at the end of a row.\nNow that the CDC recommends that everyone wear a cloth mask in settings where social distancing is difficult, Rogosin provides all staff and patients with masks. Patients who don\u2019t have confirmed or suspected COVID-19 aren\u2019t required to wear masks during treatment, Silberzweig said, but they are advised to wear them at least when traveling between their home and the dialysis center, which is often via a van that transports 3 to 5 patients. \u201cIn terms of supply\u201d of masks, he acknowledged, \u201cwe are thin but managing.\u201d\nEven before the recent CDC recommendation, DaVita Kidney Care and Fresenius Medical Care North America, the 2 big for-profit chains that treat approximately 85% of US patients who receive in-center dialysis, began requiring that every patient and employee\u2014symptomatic or not\u2014don a mask when they enter a center.\nWhen asked how DaVita acquired enough masks to implement its policy, Chief Medical Officer Jeffrey Giullian, MD, said via email that his company had launched COVID-19 task forces in January \u201cto prepare, prevent, and respond\u201d to the virus.\n\u201cThose task forces began proactively working with our suppliers and vendors,\u201d Giullian said, adding that DaVita is still concerned about having enough masks as the pandemic continues.\nWatnick said Northwest Kidney Centers lacks the supplies to implement a universal mask policy: \u201cIf we used masks for every patient who came in and every staff member, we\u2019d be out.\u201d Already, she said, her organization, unable to buy enough hand sanitizer, purchased a 55-gallon drum of alcohol so it could have a batch made.\nSegregating Centers\nIn late March, DaVita and Fresenius began designating certain shifts and, in some cases, entire centers for confirmed or suspected COVID-19\u2013positive patients only.\nDaVita implemented a 3-tier system for dialysis centers, designating tier 1 for asymptomatic patients; tier 2 for patients with suspected infections; and tier 3 for those with confirmed COVID-19, said Topf, who is a part-owner of several DaVita centers in the Detroit area.\nAs of early April, he said, Davita had designated 1 Detroit-area dialysis center for patients with COVID-19. Topf, who said he doesn\u2019t have a financial interest in that center, visited one of his patients there shortly after it opened. Because of the staff\u2019s additional personal protective equipment, \u201cIt\u2019s like walking onto the set of Contagion,\u201d he said, referring to the 2011 film about a fictional pandemic.\nAshley Henson, DaVita\u2019s director of communications, said the company has also identified centers in other parts of the country that could be restricted to patients with confirmed COVID-19 or those suspected of being infected, although she didn\u2019t know how many had begun treating only those patients.\nFresenius has both entire dialysis centers and certain shifts at other centers reserved for people who have tested positive as well as persons under investigation (PUIs)\u2014people with or without symptoms who\u2019ve been exposed to a confirmed COVID-19 case but whose own infection status is not yet known. The isolation centers are dialyzing patients with confirmed COVID-19, symptomatic PUIs, and asymptomatic PUIs on different shifts.\nOn March 31, DaVita and Fresenius announced that they were creating a nationwide contingency plan for smaller dialysis organizations to send patients who are or may be infected to the larger companies\u2019 COVID-19\u2013only facilities or shifts.\nThe collaboration\u2019s goal is to help \u201cmaintain continuity of care for dialysis patients by creating isolation cohort capacity that can be accessed by these dialysis providers, if needed,\u201d Fresenius Chief Medical Officer Robert Kossmann, MD, said in an email.\nIn contrast, Northwest Kidney Centers, which has 4 facilities without a private room, decided against designating centers for patients with COVID-19 and PUIs. \u201cWe have discussed it thoroughly and have back-up plans along those lines if needed,\u201d Watnick said, explaining that her organization would rather not shift patients to different, unfamiliar centers. \u201cThe dialysis clinic is a patient\u2019s home, so we are trying to maintain that paradigm.\u201d\nNo Place Like Home\nA mid-March Twitter chat hosted by the ASN and NephJC, a Twitter-based journal club, touched on Ottawa Hospital\u2019s plan to create a COVID-19\u2013only dialysis unit. The unit would occupy 6 rooms currently dedicated to training patients how to dialyze at home. Located within the Ontario, Canada, hospital\u2019s outpatient dialysis center, the unit would accommodate 36 patients each week.\nTwo weeks after the Twitter chat, though, the plan had fallen through, University of Ottawa nephrologist Swapnil Hiremath, MD, MPH, said in an interview. \u201cGiven ongoing concerns [about COVID-19], we decided that the home dialysis training program should not be shut down,\u201d he explained.\nFew people with ESRD dialyze at home. Among those who do, the vast majority are treated with peritoneal dialysis, which uses the abdominal cavity lining instead of a hemodialysis machine to filter blood. At the end of 2017, only about 7% of people with ESRD were treated with peritoneal dialysis, while 63% were undergoing hemodialysis\u2014only 2% of them at home, according to the USRDS.\nBut the COVID-19 pandemic has heightened interest in home dialysis, Kliger said, adding that his institution is encouraging people new to dialysis to consider learning how to do it at home.\nFewer Hours?\nDialysis organizations have considered temporarily reducing the number of hours patients dialyze each week during the pandemic, which would limit their potential exposure to COVID-19 and increase dialysis centers\u2019 capacity.\n\u201cIt won\u2019t be optimal, but we hope it would provide enough dialysis for people to at least continue to be with us until we can provide full treatments again,\u201d Watnick said, noting that on average, treatment sessions are longer at her centers than at other US dialysis facilities.\nDialysis centers might eventually have no choice but to shorten or decrease treatment sessions, Silberzweig said: \u201cDepending on how [the pandemic] progresses, we may need to resort to extreme measures like that.\u201d Not every patient would be a candidate for reduced treatment hours, he noted, because some of them build up excessive fluid between regular treatments, which can cause respiratory and cardiac problems.\nHowever, Silberzweig emphasized, for all patients with ESRD, the potential harm of dialyzing fewer hours per week is not as great as that of COVID-19.\nFortunately, Watnick said, COVID-19 fears have not stopped patients from getting treated. They tell her, \u201cWe feel safer coming to your dialysis facility than going out in the community to our doctor appointments.\u201d", "jama.2020.2131": "Since December 8, 2019, an epidemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has spread rapidly.1 As of February 6, 2020, China reported 31\u202f211 confirmed cases of COVID-19 and 637 fatalities.\nPrevious studies suggest that COVID-19 is more likely to infect older adult men, particularly those with chronic comorbidities.2-4 Few infections in children have been reported. We identified all infected infants in China and described demographic, epidemiologic, and clinical features.\nMethods\nFor this retrospective study, we identified all hospitalized infants diagnosed with COVID-19 infection between December 8, 2019, and February 6, 2020, in China. The summary number and geographic location of new COVID-19 infections, released daily by the central government, were screened to identify infants (aged 28 days to 1 year). Demographic information, including age, sex, and geographic location, released anonymously by local health departments, were then retrieved and local hospitals and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention were contacted for demographic data, family clustering (\u22651 infected family member residing with the infant), linkage to Wuhan (residing in or visiting Wuhan or contact with visitors from Wuhan \u22642 weeks before the onset of infection), clinical features (symptoms at admission, dates of admission and diagnosis), treatment (intensive care unit or mechanical ventilation), prognosis (any severe complications, including death), and discharge date. Efforts were made to reach families of patients to confirm the information.\nNasopharyngeal swabs were collected during hospitalization. Real-time polymerase chain reaction testing was used to detect COVID-19 according to the recommended protocol. Infection was defined as at least 2 positive test results.\nThis study was approved by the institutional review board of Wuhan University School of Health Sciences. Informed consent was waived as part of a public health outbreak investigation.\nResults\nNine infected infants were identified between December 8, 2019, and February 6, 2020 (Table). All patients were hospitalized. Seven patients were female. The youngest was aged 1 month and the oldest was 11 months. There were 2 patients from Beijing, 2 from Hainan, and 1 each from Guangdong, Anhui, Shanghai, Zhejiang, and Guizhou.\nFour patients were reported to have fever, 2 had mild upper respiratory tract symptoms, 1 had no symptoms but tested positive for COVID-19 in a designated screening because of exposure to infected family members, and 2 had no information on symptoms available. The time between admission and diagnosis was 1 to 3 days.\nFamilies of all 9 infants had at least 1 infected family member, with the infant\u2019s infection occurring after the family members\u2019 infection. Seven infants were reported to be either living in Wuhan or having family members who visited Wuhan, 1 had no direct linkage to Wuhan, and 1 had no information available. None of the 9 infants required intensive care or mechanical ventilation or had any severe complications.\nDiscussion\nBased on the sources of data used in this study, 9 infants were infected with COVID-19 and were hospitalized in China between December 2019 and February 6, 2020. Given the number of infections reported, the number of infected infants identified was small. This may be due to a lower risk of exposure or incomplete identification due to mild or asymptomatic disease, rather than resistance to infection.1,5 However, this study showed that infants can be infected by COVID-19; the earlier stage of the COVID-19 epidemic primarily involved adults older than 15 years.2-4\nFamily clustering occurred for all infected infants. Infants who have infected family members should be monitored or evaluated and family clustering should be reported to ensure a timely diagnosis.\nSeven of the 9 infant patients were female. Previous studies found higher percentages of infection in men than women.2-4 Whether female infants may be more susceptible to COVID-19 infection than male infants requires further study.\nThe study was limited by small sample size, inclusion only of infants who were hospitalized, and lack of inclusion of asymptomatic patients. Although a systematic and comprehensive search was made for relevant infections in infants, the epidemic is spreading rapidly and incomplete identification of cases is possible.\nBecause infants younger than 1 year cannot wear masks, they require specific protective measures. Adult caretakers should wear masks, wash hands before close contact with infants, and sterilize the infants\u2019 toys and tableware regularly.\nSection Editor: Jody W.

In the tremendous flood of viral pneumonia cases and resultant life-threatening respiratory complications, the extent of potential neurologic manifestations of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has remained unclear. In this issue of JAMA Neurology, a retrospective consecutive case series1 of 214 patients from Wuhan, China, with either moderate or severe COVID-19 reports an early view of the incidence and types of neurologic complications and sets the stage for future longitudinal work in the area.\nPrevalence of Neurologic Disease in SARS (SARS-CoV-1)\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) first appeared in China in late 2002, spreading to other areas in Asia in early 2003.2 By April 2003, a new coronavirus, SARS-CoV (now SARS-CoV-1), was identified as the causative agent.2 The typical clinical syndrome was a respiratory illness with severe lung injury and viral pneumonia, and there was a very high mortality in patients older than 65 years (approximately 50%).2 Aggressive public health efforts, taking into the account the incubation period of 2 to 10 days and the relative lack of easy transmissibility, led to limitation of the original outbreak and successful containment of the virus.2 We now know that SARS is similar in many ways clinically to COVID-19, which is caused by a very related coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2). However, the key apparent differences are dramatically increased infectivity and perhaps somewhat reduced lethality, elements that have been major drivers of the global pandemic.3\nAlthough the SARS epidemic was limited to about 8000 patients worldwide, there were some limited reports of neurologic complications of SARS that appeared in patients 2 to 3 weeks into the course of the illness, mainly consisting of either an axonal peripheral neuropathy or a myopathy with elevated creatinine kinase.4 At the time, it was unclear whether some of these manifestations might be owing to critical illness\u2013related effects,5 but pathology subsequently showed that patients with SARS had widespread vasculitis seen in many organs, including striated muscle,6 suggesting that the clinical features in these neuromuscular patients might be more than just nonspecific complications of severe illness. Interestingly, there was a single report of a patient with SARS with olfactory neuropathy with onset 3 weeks into the illness.7\nIn addition to these peripheral syndromes, 5 of 206 patients with SARS in Singapore developed large-vessel strokes. Four of these patients had their strokes in the setting of critical illness owing to SARS, and 3 were associated with significant episodes of hypotension.\nPrevalence and Timing of COVID-19 Neurologic Symptoms in Disease Course\nIn light of the sparse history of neurologic manifestations of SARS-CoV-1\u2013associated disease, the report by Mao et al1 is important. In these 214 patients, they report 36.4% had some nervous system\u2013related clinical finding.1 These neurologic manifestations ranged from fairly specific symptoms (eg, loss of sense of smell or taste, myopathy, and stroke) to more nonspecific symptoms (eg, headache, depressed level of consciousness, dizziness, or seizure).1 Whether these more nonspecific symptoms are manifestations of the disease itself or consistent with a systemic inflammatory response in patients who were quite ill will need to be defined in future studies. Importantly, the authors found that patients in their series with some of the more common specific symptoms, including smell or taste impairment and myopathy, tended to have these symptoms early in their clinical course; this appears to be quite distinct from SARS, where manifestations appeared quite late in established disease. A report8 of viral infiltration of the brainstem in a very limited number of pathologic specimens also raises the possibility that some of the crucial pathophysiology behind respiratory failure may be owing to central nervous system pathology, further expanding the view of which clinical manifestations of the current pandemic are truly neurologic in nature.\nMost Stroke and Depressed Level of Consciousness Occurs Later and in More Severe Disease\nMao et al1 also found that neurologic symptoms were more common in patients with more severe disease (30.2% in nonsevere patients and 45.5% in severe patients). As has commonly been the case, they defined the severity based on respiratory features, defining mild as not requiring respiratory intervention, moderate as requiring some respiratory support, and severe as requiring mechanical ventilation. The more dramatic neurologic symptoms, such as stroke, ataxia, seizure, and depressed level of consciousness, all were more common in severely affected patients, accounting for the increased incidence in these patients.1 However, these associations should be considered in light of our understanding that patients with severe complications from SARS-COV-2 are more likely to have medical comorbidities, especially vascular risk factors such as hypertension.9 The occurrence of cerebrovascular events in critically ill patients with underlying high blood pressure and cardiovascular disease is therefore potentially unrelated to a direct effect of the infection itself or an inappropriate host response.\nContinued Surveillance for Other Acute or Postinfectious Conditions and Challenges\nThe finding that many patients presented early with neurologic symptoms, such as anosmia, ageusia, and myopathy, along with less severe respiratory symptoms suggests that neurologists may be confronted by patients presenting with new-onset neurologic symptoms and should be potentially concerned that these could be owing to COVID-19. Reports have emphasized anosmia as a common early feature of COVID-19 illness, as in many upper respiratory tract infections,10 although with COVID 19, many patients have loss of sense of smell without congestion.\nThe aforementioned previous studies that demonstrated axonal neuropathy in a small number of patients with SARS raise questions of whether this will likewise be the case in COVID-19 . Unfortunately, the series by Mao et al1 was unable to shed clear light on these questions because the authors were unable to pursue detailed electromyography/nerve conduction studies or lumbar puncture in their patients owing to concerns about the pandemic and highly infectious nature of COVID-19. The authors did report nerve pain in 4 of the severely affected patients, and myopathy was also more common in severe patients. Given the likely shared vasculitic pathology of SARS and COVID-19, it seems probable that further studies will reveal neuropathy as another rare finding in COVID-19.\nCoronavirus disease 2019 has now reached pandemic status and is common all over the world; thus, with so many affected patients, we can expect as neurologists to be confronted with these patients commonly in coming months and years. It is clear that this small series does not reflect the entire spectrum of neurologic disease in COVID-19 disease, and much is left to be learned with thorough neurologic testing in large data sets of patients with COVID-19. As the means for reliably assessing infection and prior exposure become available, less common neurologic complications should be anticipated; however, this glimpse into neurologic manifestations opens a window into neurologists\u2019 role and places them on the front lines of the pandemic.\nBack to top\nArticle Information\nCorresponding Author: S.

Common symptoms include fever, fatigue, cough, and shortness of breath.1 Although most cases result in mild symptoms, it is estimated that around 5% of patients develop severe pneumonia and multiorgan failure.2 A recent Italian study3 reported a spectrum of cutaneous eruptions with nonspecific features in more than 20% of a small cohort of patients with COVID-19. We report a case of a digitate papulosquamous eruption occurring during a SARS-CoV-2 infection.\nReport of a Case\nAn elderly patient with type 2 diabetes, hypertension, peripheral artery disease, and chronic renal failure was admitted to the intensive care unit in the spring of 2020 for acute respiratory distress. One week earlier, the patient had felt some fatigue with fever and dyspnea, which did not improve after treatment with cefpodoxime at a dose of 200 mg twice a day for 5 days. Computed tomography of the chest showed bilateral peripheral ground-glass opacities with subpleural condensation. A nasopharyngeal SARS-CoV-2 reverse transcriptase\u2013polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) confirmed the diagnosis of COVID-19.\nOne day after hospital admission, the patient developed a squamous and erythematous periumbilical patch (Figure 1A) with rapid progression of other similar digitate scaly thin plaques on the lateral side of the trunk and thighs. Some lesions on the upper arms (Figure 1B), shoulders, and back were papular. This digitate papulosquamous eruption was clinically reminiscent of pityriasis rosea. A skin biopsy of the left shoulder revealed foci of spongiosis with focal parakeratosis in the epidermis and a few rounded spongiotic vesicles containing aggregates of lymphocytes and Langerhans cells. A moderate lymphohistiocytic infiltrate was present in the superficial dermis and was associated with papillary dermal edema (Figure 2). We performed RT-PCR on a fresh skin biopsy specimen, and the results were negative for SARS-CoV-2. Results of blood tests, including HIV serologic tests, treponemal and nontreponemal antigen tests for syphilis, tests for cytomegalovirus infection, and Mycoplasma pneumoniae PCR, were negative, whereas Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) PCR results were positive, with a viral load of 4.6 log10 copies/mL reflecting EBV replication. Serologic markers indicated reactivation and ruled out acute mononucleosis. The cutaneous rash resolved spontaneously within a week. The patient died of COVID-19\u2013related illness.\nFigure 1.

The association between SARS-CoV-2 infection and this eruption is presumptive. Although the patient had a laboratory-proven respiratory infection caused by SARS-CoV-2, the RT-PCR result from the skin sample was negative for SARS-CoV-2, which fits our current understanding of the tissue specificity of the virus. The skin symptoms could be a secondary result of the immune response against the virus. Most patients with severe cases of COVID-19, as in our case, demonstrate elevated levels of proinflammatory cytokines and infection-related biomarkers.4 Alternatively, we did not find supportive evidence of a cutaneous drug reaction, considering that the cefpodoxime treatment (half-life, 2 hours) was stopped more than 30 hours before onset of the eruption, which did not evoke a drug-related rash. The eruption also differed from classic pityriasis rosea owing to the absence of an initial oval erythematous plaque with a scaly collarette termed herald patch5 and the early spontaneous resolution of the cutaneous lesions over a weeklong period. Although our test results showed reactivation of EBV, which can be observed in the setting of other viral infections, we did not suspect that the rash in this patient was related to EBV.6\nOur observation can be included in the complex category of paraviral dermatoses. Owing to the current COVID-19 pandemic, clinicians should be aware of this new potential association.\nBack to top\nArticle Information\nCorresponding Author: Bethsab\u00e9e Garel, MD, H\u00f4pital Cochin, Assistance Publique-H\u00f4pitaux de Paris, Division of Dermatology and Venereology, Pavillon Tarnier, 89 rue d\u2019Assas, 75006 Paris, France (bethsabee.garel@aphp.fr).\nPublished Online: April 30, 2020. doi:10.1001/jamadermatol.2020.1704\nConflict of Interest Disclosures: None reported.\nReferences\n1.\nHe  F\ufeff , Deng  Y\ufeff , Li  W\ufeff .

This observation reports dermatologic findings associated with a confirmed case of COVID-19.\nReport of a Case\nA 48-year-old man with a history of hypertension presented to the emergency department in March 2020, during the COVID-19 outbreak in Madrid, Spain. He reported an onset of fever (up to 39 \u00b0C) several days before admission, along with pleuritic chest pain and shortness of breath. He noticed the abrupt appearance of slightly pruritic skin lesions 3 days after the onset of fever. He had not taken any new drugs during the year before this episode.\nPhysical examination revealed confluent erythematous macules, papules, and petechiae in a symmetric periflexural distribution affecting the buttocks, popliteal fossae, proximal anterior thighs, and lower abdomen. A striking absence of lesions in the crural folds was noted (Figure 1). There were no acral or mucosal lesions.\nFigure 1.  Clinical Presentation at the Emergency Department\nView LargeDownload\nThe exanthem consists of erythematous macules, papules, and petechiae affecting the popliteal fossae (A), buttocks (A and B), and anterior thighs (C).\nPosteroanterior and lateral chest radiographs showed ground-glass opacities in both lower pulmonary fields consistent with atypical pneumonia. A complete blood cell count revealed a lymphocyte count of 750/\u03bcL (reference range, 1000-4500/\u03bcL) (to convert to \u00d7109/L, multiply by 0.001), a C-reactive protein level of 1.7 mg/dL (reference range, 0-0.5 mg/L) (to convert to mg/L, multiply by 10), and a D-dimer level of 0.68 \u03bcg/mL (reference range, 0-0.5 \u03bcg/mL) (to convert to nmol/L, multiply by 5.476). The platelet count and coagulation parameters were normal. Serologic test results were negative for HIV, hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus, and parvovirus B19. Results of real-time reverse transcriptase\u2013polymerase chain reaction from a nasopharyngeal swab were positive for SARS-CoV-2.\nA 5-mm punch biopsy specimen from the left buttock revealed a superficial perivascular lymphocytic infiltrate with abundant red cell extravasation and focal papillary edema, along with focal parakeratosis and isolated dyskeratotic cells. No features of thrombotic vasculopathy were present (Figure 2).\nFigure 2.  Histopathologic Findings\nView LargeDownload\nThe biopsy specimen reveals red cell extravasation, dermal papillary edema, and scattered dyskeratotic keratinocytes (hematoxylin-eosin, original magnification \u00d7100).\nThe patient was hospitalized and treated with hydroxychloroquine (200 mg twice a day), lopinavir-ritonavir (200 mg/50 mg twice a day), and azithromycin (250 mg/d). The patient continued to receive his regular hypertension medication, telmisartan. The rash was treated with 0.05% betamethasone dipropionate cream twice a day and loratadine (10 mg/d). The cutaneous lesions resolved after 5 days. The patient recovered from his respiratory illness and was released from the hospital after 12 days.\nDiscussion\nTo our knowledge, there is only 1 other report of petechial skin lesions in a SARS-CoV-2\u2013infected patient, initially believed to have dengue fever.1 Other coronaviruses such as human coronavirus NL63 have been associated with purpuric eruptions, including acute hemorrhagic edema of infancy.2 During the COVID-19 outbreak in China, dermatologic symptoms were regarded as possible comorbid conditions, drug reactions, or occupational skin diseases3\u2014unrelated to SARS-CoV-2.\nViral rashes can be polymorphic. In this patient, the clinical picture resembled the periflexural petechial exanthem of parvovirus B19. Skin biopsy specimens from patients with this disease show a perivascular mononuclear inflammatory infiltrate, eosinophils, and extravasated erythrocytes; in addition, viral proteins from parvovirus B19 have been found within the endothelial cells of dermal vessels and could be implicated in the pathogenesis of purpura.4 We hypothesize that SARS-CoV-2 could affect the skin in a similar way. Some histologic features in this case (ie, mounds of parakeratosis, mild spongiosis, extravasated erythrocytes) overlap with those of pityriasis rosea, which is suspected to have a viral pathogenesis.5 Adverse drug reactions to supportive medications used in patients with severe viral infections are an important diagnostic consideration; however, in this case the rash preceded the initiation of lopinavir-ritonavir and hydroxychloroquine.\nSharing the images of this case may benefit physicians dealing with similar rashes in undiagnosed patients during this pandemic. We hope that, in the upcoming months, skin rashes associated with COVID-19 will be better understood.\nBack to top\nArticle Information\nCorresponding Author: Borja Diaz-Guimaraens, MD, Dermatology Department, Ramon y Cajal University Hospital, Carretera Colmenar Viejo km 9.100, 28034 Madrid, Spain (borja.diazg@edu.uah.es).\nPublished Online: April 30, 2020. doi:10.1001/jamadermatol.2020.1741\nConflict of Interest Disclosures: None reported.\nAdditional Contributions: We thank the patient for granting permission to publish this information.

During the short period between the launch of JAMA Health Forum and today, many countries have been overwhelmed by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, with nearly 2.4 million confirmed cases and more than 165\u202f000 deaths worldwide by April 19. As the pandemic has accelerated since mid-March, JAMA Health Forum has published many insightful commentaries on a broad range of health policy topics related to COVID-19, including the following widely read articles:\nGuidance for hospitals to prepare for the immense surge in demand2\nProviding personal protective equipment to health care workers3\nNursing homes as ground zero for the pandemic4\nPandemic effects on the US health care economy5\nMental health needs of frontline health care workers6\nRegional strategies to expand ventilator capacity7 and to support primary care8\nEquitable food access during the pandemic9\nImportance of state tracking data\u2014including for COVID-19\u2014to support decisions by policy makers10\nIn our video conversation with Howard Bauchner, we discussed some of these recent JAMA Health Forum articles along with new developments in US health policy related to the pandemic. These topics included federal stimulus payments to hospitals and medical groups that have experienced steep drops in revenue, the elimination of patient cost-sharing for COVID-19 testing, and the rapid adoption of telehealth services by health care systems and medical groups to deliver virtual primary and specialty care via telephone and video visits. We also discussed the need to strengthen public health systems and integrate them more effectively with health care systems to contain the COVID-19 pandemic. Finally, we highlighted the looming stresses on health care costs and financing, including increased burdens on state budgets and the potential for greater consolidation in the health care industry.\nAs JAMA Health Forum moves forward, we continue to welcome prospective authors to submit novel Insights that address important health policy issues in the United States and around the globe\u2014whether on COVID-19, the ongoing US presidential election, or innovations in health care financing and delivery.\nReferences\n1.\nAyanian  JZ\ufeff , Buntin  MB\ufeff .

Since then, the World Health Organization (WHO) has declared this a public health emergency of international concern because of the global spread. As of March 2, 2020, there are 88 948 cases among 65 countries, including 3043 deaths.1 The spread has continued across all continents except Antarctica and is rapidly being identified in more and more states in the US.\nWhile modes of viral transmission are still currently being researched, there have been anecdotal reports of ocular transmission.2 The RNA of SARS-CoV was previously identified in tears in 2003.3 Given the genetic similarity of SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19, as well as the purported use of similar mechanisms to infect host cells, ocular shedding of viruses is a possibility that should be recognized by practicing ophthalmologists around the world.\nBefore appearances in Europe, North America, South America, and Africa, Singapore experienced local transmission in multiple clusters across the country. The National University Hospital Department of Ophthalmology, a high-volume ophthalmology center in Singapore, therefore provides an example of infection control measures implemented in the setting of COVID-19 infections that may be of value as other ophthalmology clinics begin to experience and plan for potential increases of COVID-19 risks. Such awareness may allow ophthalmologists to balance the infectious disease risks with continuing care for ophthalmology patients during this unique period, prompting this perspective of infection control strategies at the National University Hospital Department of Ophthalmology (Singapore) for consideration by other departments around the world addressing their infection control protocols at this time.\nPatient Stratification in the Clinic\nDuring epidemics, achieving a balance between infection control and the provision of ophthalmology services is crucial. COVID-19 potentially can be life threatening. In contrast, most ocular conditions are not life threatening or usually progress over a longer time. Hence, identifying patients at risk of infection and determining the risk-benefit profile of treating their ocular issues is crucial.\nAt the National University Hospital Department of Ophthalmology, in the current setting of COVID-19, patients with routine follow-ups currently are triaged by 3 criteria: (1) presence of infective symptoms or signs (eg, fever, cough, or shortness of breath), (2) a visit to China during the past 14 days, and (3) close contact with patients who received a diagnosis of COVID-19. For those who do not meet any criteria, the ophthalmology visit proceeds as usual. Those fulfilling 1 criteria are further triaged on the urgency of their consultation, recognizing that recommendations from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention include not only identifying those with fever, cough, or shortness of breath, but also who have been in close contact with a person known to have COVID-19 or who has recently traveled from an area with widespread or ongoing community spread of COVID-19.4 At the National University Hospital Department of Ophthalmology, a team comprising ophthalmology trainees and ophthalmologists review the case notes and obtain an ophthalmology history via telephone to determine the urgency for follow-up. Patients who are deemed stable and attending routine follow-ups have consultations postponed. Patients with urgent ocular issues will proceed with a full consult in an isolation room with physicians wearing gowns, surgical masks, eye shields, and gloves. In the scenario that a patient has a fever, an N95 mask will be worn instead.\nPatients who fulfill 2 or more criteria are triaged to an isolation room where the team reviews them with full personal protective equipment (PPE), including a gown, N95 mask, face shield, and gloves. These patients are reviewed for their ocular condition and possible pneumonia. If signs of pneumonia, such as poor oxygen saturation and lung crepitations, are heard, the patient is sent to the emergency department for further evaluation. Otherwise, the patient will be sent to a community general practice for further evaluation. This system allows the continued review of healthy patients and identification of at-risk individuals for further triaging. Care for patients with urgent ocular issues is therefore not compromised and appropriate PPE presumably protects clinicians from infection.\nProtection of Health Care Workers\nDuring the 2003 SARS-CoV crisis, health care workers (HCWs) represented approximately 20% of those with infection.5 Hence, adequate protection for HCWs against infection is crucial. Close monitoring for HCW transmission is also important for implementing early containment measures.\nWhile it is easy to recommend the PPE offering the most protection for all scenarios, overuse will lead to diminishing supplies and higher infection risk as the epidemic escalates. To prevent this, the PPE worn by HCWs at the National University Hospital Department of Ophthalmology depends on the risk of infection; for all patients who fulfill 2 criteria, the full PPE of N95 mask, gown, face shield, and gloves recommended by WHO are worn. For patients who have positive results for only 1 criteria, a gown, surgical mask, face shield, and gloves are worn instead. If these patients are febrile, the N95 mask is worn.\nTo reduce droplet transmission from sporadic coughs and sneezes by patients during the slitlamp examination, a protective shield made of previously used radiography films has been implemented. Droplets from sneezes can travel up to 6 m.6 While not clinically validated, avoiding a direct sneeze or cough may reduce the number of droplets reaching the physician\u2019s face until appropriate tests of these presumed protective measures are evaluated. The shield can result in difficulty performing routine ophthalmology examinations, as it forces the examiner to adopt a relatively awkward hand position. Further design improvements are currently being considered.\nMonitoring of HCWs is also important for infection control. All HCWs have to report twice-daily temperatures on an online system and indicate the development of any infective symptoms. All travel plans must be declared for contact-tracing purposes. These measures ensure early identification of HCW infections so that quarantine measures can be administered promptly to all affected personnel.\nEquipment Sterilization\nSimilar to the WHO recommendations, all shared equipment having contact with ocular tissues, such as slitlamps and b-scan probes, are disinfected with 70% ethyl alcohol after use. Studies have shown reductions in surrogate coronavirus infectivity when treated with ethyl alcohol.6 A 10% diluted sodium hypochlorite is used to sterilize intraocular pressure monitoring devices, such as the Goldman tonometer. Commonly known as bleach, it also has been shown to effectively inactivate various coronaviruses.7 Isolation rooms used to examine patients with positive criteria are terminally sterilized before the next use. These disinfection protocols do not differ from daily clinic protocols.\nAs more information about COVID-19 emerges, these measures likely will continue to undergo revision to try to ensure eye care services can be provided safely. Meanwhile, these measures may serve as a starting point for those beginning to consider this new threat for ophthalmology practices, especially in areas where the number of cases may climb rapidly in the near future.\nBack to top\nArticle Information\nCorresponding Author: Ivan Seah Yu Jun, MBBS, Department of Ophthalmology, National University Hospital, 5 Lower Kent Ridge Rd, Singapore 119074 (ivan.seah@mohh.com.sg).\nPublished Online: March 31, 2020. doi:10.1001/jamaophthalmol.2020.1288\nConflict of Interest Disclosures: None reported.\nReferences\n1.\nWorld Health Organization.

Preliminary epidemiological data show an uneven-handed impact on the population, with an exponential increase in disease severity and mortality in those beyond the sixth decade of life with cardiovascular disease (CVD) and diabetes. Given that angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), an enzyme coopted by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) to enter epithelial cells, is upregulated in patients with CVD and diabetes treated with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), it was proposed that this increase in ACE2 expression underpins the greater COVID-19 severity in this population. This has created substantial controversy regarding the approach to patients taking ACEIs/ARBs in preparation for the pandemic, with some advocating for discontinuing these medications while expert opinions recommended against discontinuation, given the lack of strong evidence.1\nTo begin to unravel this complex dilemma, we must consider the role of ACE2 not only in COVID-19 pathogenesis but also as a component of renin-angiotensin system (RAS) signaling throughout the body. First, one must recognize the scarcity of data on the topic, particularly in humans. Nonetheless, the urgency of the situation makes it imperative to use inductive reasoning to guide our next steps toward protecting our patients. It is well established now that while ACE2 is targeted by SARS-CoV-2 to gain entrance into cells, it plays a major anti-inflammatory role in RAS signaling by converting angiotensin II, the quintessential perpetrator of inflammation,2 to angiotensin 1-7, which carries anti-inflammatory properties.3\nWhat has been missing in discussions of the aforementioned dilemma is the age-associated decline in ACE2 expression, as observed in the lungs of rats,4 which is in line with a constellation of major proinflammatory changes perpetrated by an age-associated increase in RAS signaling throughout the body.5 Exaggerated forms of this proinflammatory profile are also salient pathophysiologic features of hypertension and diabetes, which are highly prevalent at older ages.5 The upregulation of ACE2 in individuals with diabetes and hypertension treated with ACEIs/ARBs is, in a way, restorative of physiological function. Hence, these observations raise an apparent paradox: given ACE2 itself is the gateway of SARS-CoV-2 entry into cells, how can the reduction in ACE2 levels in older persons and those with CVD predispose for greater COVID-19 severity?\nThis apparent paradox becomes clear if we distinguish the role of ACE2 as a gateway for SARS-CoV-2 facilitating the infection from its pivotal anti-inflammatory function in RAS signaling that is compromised in individuals with COVID-19, contributing to its severity (Figure).3 Indeed, data on the severe acute respiratory syndrome epidemic of 2003 demonstrates this divergence in factors predisposing to disease occurrence and its severity; in the former epidemic, although younger individuals in their third and fourth decades of life accounted for most of those infected,6 these younger patients had lower disease severity and risk of mortality compared with older people with preexisting conditions.\nFigure.  Schematic of Inflammatory Profile Before and After Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Infection\nView LargeDownload\nSimplified schematic of the preinfection inflammatory profile among predisposed older individuals vs their younger counterparts. ACE2 indicates angiotensin-converting enzyme 2; CVD, cardiovascular disease; SARS-CoV-2, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2.\nSimilarly, in the COVID-19 pandemic, it is plausible that greater expression of ACE2 leads to higher predisposition to incur the disease; preliminary epidemiologic data from South Korea, where the most population-wide testing has taken place, show that most cases are among younger adults7 who are expected to have higher levels of ACE2.4 However, when it comes to COVID-19 severity, reduction in ACE2 levels with aging and CVD and its associated upregulation of angiotensin II proinflammatory pathway8 likely predispose older individuals with cardiovascular comorbidities to severe forms of COVID-19, as has been observed in Italy.7 This predisposition is exploited with SARS-CoV-2 binding to ACE2 itself, further reducing ACE2 cell surface expression, upregulating angiotensin II signaling in the lungs, and yielding acute lung injury.3 Hence, compared with young individuals, older persons with CVD who already have reduced ACE2 levels will be expected to be more predisposed to exaggerated inflammation with further reduction in ACE2 expression in the context of COVID-19, manifesting with greater disease severity.\nIn summary, older individuals, especially those with hypertension and diabetes, have reduced ACE2 expression and upregulation of angiotensin II proinflammatory signaling; the increase in ACE2 levels with ACEI/ARB treatment is more likely to be corrective to these changes. We hypothesize that with superimposed COVID-19 disease, SARS-CoV-2 binding to ACE2 acutely exaggerates this proinflammatory background, predisposing these subpopulations to greater COVID-19 disease severity and mortality (Figure). This hypothesis is in line with the evidence of a protective role of angiotensin II antagonism against sepsis-associated acute lung injury9,10 and supports continuing therapy with ACEIs/ARBs and, more so, urgently calls for expanding ongoing trials treating patients with severe COVID-19 with RAS interventions to examine the role of these interventions in preventing lethal lung complications of COVID-19 as cases surge around the world.\nBack to top\nArticle Information\nCorresponding Author: Majd AlGhatrif, MD, MA, Laboratory of Cardiovascular Science, National Institute on Aging, National Institutes of Health, 251 Bayview Blvd, Baltimore, MD 21043 (alghatrifm@nih.gov).\nPublished Online: April 3, 2020. doi:10.1001/jamacardio.2020.1329\nConflict of Interest Disclosures: None reported.\nReferences\n1.\nBozkurt  B\ufeff , Kovacs  R\ufeff , Harrington  B\ufeff .

The virus was first identified in Wuhan, China, after an outbreak of pneumonia of unknown cause was identified in December 2019, with most early cases reporting exposure to a live animal market. On December 31, 2019, China reported the outbreak to the World Health Organization, and shortly thereafter, the responsible pathogen was identified as a novel coronavirus, which is called SARS-CoV-2 because of its sequence similarity to the virus causing severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). The situation of COVID-19 is evolving rapidly with increasing numbers of cases and involved countries. On January 30, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the novel coronavirus outbreak a public health emergency of international concern, and on March 11, 2020, the outbreak was declared a pandemic. As of March 25, 2020, more than 425\u202f000 cases have been confirmed globally in 170 countries and regions, including more than 55\u202f000 cases in the United States.1\nBackground\nCoronaviruses cause a wide range of illness, ranging from the common cold to severe, fatal illness. Three coronaviruses causing severe illness in humans have emerged in the past 20 years: the virus causing SARS, which emerged in China in 2002; the virus causing Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), which emerged in the Arabian peninsula in 2012; and the virus causing COVID-19.2 Common manifestations of COVID-19 in adults include fever, cough, myalgia, shortness of breath, headache, and diarrhea. Based on data from more than 72\u202f000 patients from China, most (81%) were mildly affected, 14% had severe manifestations (eg, with dyspnea or blood oxygen saturation \u226493%), and 5% were critically ill (eg, with respiratory failure or septic shock).3 Risk factors for severe illness were older age and underlying illnesses. The case fatality rate in China was 2.3%,3 although this number might be an overestimate because mild or asymptomatic cases might have been missed. Transmission of COVID-19 is thought to be primarily through respiratory droplets formed when a person with an infection coughs or sneezes, which can be inhaled by contacts within close range (within 6 ft), who then become infected. Other types of transmission (eg, transmission from fomites, fecal-oral transmission) might be possible. The median incubation period is 5 days (range, 2-14 days). At this time, care of patients with severe illness is supportive, since US Food and Drug Administration\u2013approved therapeutics are not available. Although vaccine development is ongoing, it is expected that a vaccine will not be ready for wide distribution for at least a year.4\nWhat Is Known About COVID-19 in Children?\nChildren are typically more susceptible to influenza complications, yet so far, they have experienced lower-than-expected rates of COVID-19 disease, and deaths in children appear to be rare. In more than 72\u202f000 total cases from China, 1.2% were in patients aged 10 to 19 years, and even fewer (0.9%) were in patients younger than 10 years.3 Only 1 death in this study was in the adolescent age range, and no children in the age range of 0 to 10 years died. In a separate analysis of 2143 confirmed and suspected pediatric cases from China, infants were at the highest risk of severe disease (10.6%), compared with older children (4.1% for those aged 11 to 15 years; 3.0% in those 16 years and older).5\nAmong children who become ill, manifestations of COVID-19 appear to be similar to those in adults. Among 28 pediatric patients reported by Shen and Yang,6 age ranged from 1 month to 16 years. Several patients were asymptomatic at diagnosis and identified as part of contact investigations. Several patients had fever, fatigue, dry cough, and other respiratory symptoms; gastrointestinal manifestations were infrequent.\nTransmission is likely the same as that seen in adults. Thus far, no convincing evidence of intrauterine transmission has been identified, but only a small number of pregnancies have been described.2 Whether COVID-19 can be transmitted through breastfeeding is unknown, to our knowledge. Among 6 mothers whose breastmilk samples were tested for SARS-CoV-2, all specimens were negative.2\nDespite the low frequency of illness and death from COVID-19 in children in China, there are reasons to remain vigilant about infection in children. The lower-than-expected rates of children affected by COVID-19 in China might be because of decreased exposure to the virus, decreased infection with the virus because of immunity to other coronaviruses, or decreased likelihood of illness, even when infected with the virus. If children are infected but asymptomatic, they could serve as a source of transmission to adults. At least 1 child with no symptoms but with a high SARS-CoV-2 viral load has been reported,7 suggesting that transmission from children who are asymptomatic is possible.\nHow US children experience COVID-19 remains to be detailed, although no intensive care unit admissions or deaths were reported among persons younger than 19 years among 4226 patients with COVID-19 in the US through March 16, 2020.8 In a small study from China, 7 of 20 pediatric patients who were ill with COVID-19 had a prior history of a congenital or acquired disease,9 leading the authors to suggest the children with underlying illness might be more susceptible. About 10% of children in the US have asthma; many children live with other pulmonary, cardiac, neuromuscular, or genetic diseases that affect their ability to handle respiratory disease, and other children are immunosuppressed because of illness or its treatment. It is possible that these children will experience COVID-19 differently than counterparts of the same ages who are healthy.\nConsiderations for Pediatric Health Care Clinicians\nPediatric health care clinicians can help to prepare their offices, facilities, and communities for increased COVID-19 disease. Special accommodations should be made to isolate children who are potentially ill with COVID-19 from those who are well in the waiting room, especially focusing on minimizing exposures for those with special health care needs. In communities with widespread transmission, limiting healthy children from visiting the health care system for nonurgent reasons (eg, nonurgent surgeries) might be warranted, while continuing to see newborns and infants for preventive care and younger children who need vaccines. This action will necessitate robust telephone triage and expansion of existing telehealth visits. Differentiating potential COVID-19 illness from other illnesses, such as influenza, will be difficult until testing for COVID-19 becomes more broadly available. In communities with widespread transmission, community mitigation interventions, such as school closures, cancellation of mass gatherings, and closure of public places are appropriate.10 If these measures are required, pediatricians need to advocate to alleviate unintended consequences or inadvertent expansion of health disparities on children, such as by finding ways to maintain nutrition for those who depend on school lunches and provide online mental health services for stress management for families whose routines might be severely interrupted for an extended period of time.\nConclusions\nIn conclusion, COVID-19 is an emerging illness that is rapidly spreading through the US and the world. Early data suggest that the effects on children are less severe than those on adults, yet many questions remain, especially regarding the effects on children with special health care needs. Surveillance of COVID-19 in the pediatric population, including seroprevalence studies, is needed to better understand its influence on US children. Clinicians need to work with school and community leaders to implement interventions that slow disease spread and prevent severe illness and death, while ensuring that unintended consequences of these interventions on children are minimized.\nBack to top\nArticle Information\nCorresponding Author: Sonja A.

Most cases were classified as mild (81%; ie, nonpneumonia and mild pneumonia). However, 14% were severe (ie, dyspnea, respiratory frequency \u226530/min, blood oxygen saturation \u226493%, partial pressure of arterial oxygen to fraction of inspired oxygen ratio <300, and/or lung infiltrates >50% within 24 to 48 hours), and 5% were critical (ie, respiratory failure, septic shock, and/or multiple organ dysfunction or failure) (Box).1\nThe overall case-fatality rate (CFR) was 2.3% (1023 deaths among 44\u202f672 confirmed cases). No deaths occurred in the group aged 9 years and younger, but cases in those aged 70 to 79 years had an 8.0% CFR and cases in those aged 80 years and older had a 14.8% CFR. No deaths were reported among mild and severe cases. The CFR was 49.0% among critical cases. CFR was elevated among those with preexisting comorbid conditions\u201410.5% for cardiovascular disease, 7.3% for diabetes, 6.3% for chronic respiratory disease, 6.0% for hypertension, and 5.6% for cancer. Among the 44\u202f672 cases, a total of 1716 were health workers (3.8%), 1080 of whom were in Wuhan (63%). Overall, 14.8% of confirmed cases among health workers were classified as severe or critical and 5 deaths were observed.1\nCOVID-19 rapidly spread from a single city to the entire country in just 30 days. The sheer speed of both the geographical expansion and the sudden increase in numbers of cases surprised and quickly overwhelmed health and public health services in China, particularly in Wuhan City and Hubei Province. Epidemic curves reflect what may be a mixed outbreak pattern, with early cases suggestive of a continuous common source, potentially zoonotic spillover at Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, and later cases suggestive of a propagated source as the virus began to be transmitted from person to person (Figure 1).1\nFigure 1.

SARS was initiated by zoonotic transmission of a novel coronavirus (likely from bats via palm civets) in markets in Guangdong Province, China. MERS was also traced to zoonotic transmission of a novel coronavirus (likely from bats via dromedary camels) in Saudi Arabia. All 3 viral infections commonly present with fever and cough, which frequently lead to lower respiratory tract disease with poor clinical outcomes associated with older age and underlying health conditions. Confirmation of infection requires nucleic acid testing of respiratory tract samples (eg, throat swabs), but clinical diagnosis may be made based on symptoms, exposures, and chest imaging. Supportive care for patients is typically the standard protocol because no specific effective antiviral therapies have been identified.\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) declared the SARS outbreak contained on July 5, 2003. A total of 8096 SARS cases and 774 deaths across 29 countries were reported for an overall CFR of 9.6%. MERS is still not contained and is thus far responsible for 2494 confirmed cases and 858 deaths across 27 countries for a CFR of 34.4%. Despite much higher CFRs for SARS and MERS, COVID-19 has led to more total deaths due to the large number of cases. As of the end of February 18, 2020, China has reported 72\u202f528 confirmed cases (98.9% of the global total) and 1870 deaths (99.8% of the global total). This translates to a current crude CFR of 2.6%. However, the total number of COVID-19 cases is likely higher due to inherent difficulties in identifying and counting mild and asymptomatic cases. Furthermore, the still-insufficient testing capacity for COVID-19 in China means that many suspected and clinically diagnosed cases are not yet counted in the denominator.2 This uncertainty in the CFR may be reflected by the important difference between the CFR in Hubei (2.9%) compared with outside Hubei (0.4%).1,2 Nevertheless, all CFRs still need to be interpreted with caution and more research is required.\nMost secondary transmission of SARS and MERS occurred in the hospital setting. Transmission of COVID-19 is occurring in this context as well\u20143019 cases have been observed among health workers as of February 11, 2020 (of whom there have been 1716 confirmed cases and 5 deaths).1 However, this is not a major means of COVID-19 spread. Rather, it appears that considerable transmission is occurring among close contacts. To date, 20 provinces outside of Hubei have reported 1183 case clusters, 88% of which contained 2 to 4 confirmed cases. Of note, 64% of clusters documented thus far have been within familial households (Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention presentation made to the WHO Assessment Team on February 16, 2020). Thus, although COVID-19 seems to be more transmissible than SARS and MERS, and many estimates of the COVID-19 reproductive number (R0) have already been published, it is still too soon to develop an accurate R0 estimate or to assess the dynamics of transmission. More research is needed in this area as well.\nResponse to the COVID-19 Epidemic\nSince 2003, the Chinese government has improved its epidemic response capacity. Some of these efforts are evident in the response to COVID-19 (Figure 2). For example, in the 2002-2003 SARS outbreak, 300 cases and 5 deaths already had occurred by the time China reported the outbreak to the WHO, whereas in the COVID-19 outbreak, only 27 cases and zero deaths had occurred when the WHO was notified (January 3, 2020) (Figure 2). From the time of WHO notification, 2 months elapsed before SARS-CoV was identified compared with only 1 week from the time of WHO notification until 2019-nCoV was identified.\nFigure 2.

The timeline of events for the COVID-19 outbreak (right) from the onset of symptoms for the first case on December 8, 2019, to status on February 20, 2020. Over the course of the first 2 months, more than 70\u202f000 cases have been confirmed and many more are suspected. WHO indicates World Health Organization.\naIdentified later retrospectively.\nThe timing of the COVID-19 outbreak, prior to China\u2019s annual Lunar New Year holiday, was an important factor as China considered how to respond to the outbreak. Culturally, this is the largest and most important holiday of the year. It is the expectation that people return to their family homes, which is the cause for the several billion person-trips made by residents and visitors during this time, mostly on crowded planes, trains, and buses. Knowing this meant each infected person could have numerous close contacts over a protracted time and across long distances, the government needed to quickly act. However, it was not only the speed of the government\u2019s response, but also the magnitude of that response that were influenced by the impending holiday travel time. Knowing that specific treatment and prevention options, such as targeted antiviral drugs and vaccines, were not yet available for COVID-19, China focused on traditional public health outbreak response tactics\u2014isolation, quarantine, social distancing, and community containment.3-5\nIdentified case patients with COVID-19 were immediately isolated in designated wards in existing hospitals, and 2 new hospitals were rapidly built to isolate and care for the increasing numbers of cases in Wuhan and Hubei. People who had been in contact with COVID-19 cases were asked to quarantine themselves at home or were taken to special quarantine facilities, where they could be monitored for onset of symptoms. Enormous numbers of large gatherings were canceled, including all Lunar New Year celebrations, and traffic in Wuhan and in cities across Hubei was restricted and closely monitored. Virtually all transportation was subsequently restricted at a national level. All of these measures were instituted to achieve social distancing. In addition, an estimated 40 million to 60 million residents of Wuhan and 15 other surrounding cities within Hubei Province were subjected to community containment measures. Although these types of traditional outbreak response actions have been successfully used in the past, they have never been executed on such a large scale.\nThere have been some questions about whether these actions are reasonable and proportional responses to the outbreak. Some have argued that a number of these approaches may infringe on the civil liberties of citizens, and some of these measures have been referred to as \u201cdraconian.\u201d However, it is not only individual rights that must be considered. The rights of those who are not infected, but at risk of infection, must be considered as well. Whether these approaches have been effective (eg, in terms of reduced infections and deaths averted), and whether these potential benefits have outweighed the costs (eg, economic losses), will be debated for years.4,5\nNext Steps\nImportantly, another major goal of China\u2019s current outbreak response activities is to help \u201cbuy time\u201d for science to catch up before COVID-19 becomes too widespread. China must now focus on adjusting tactics and strategies as new evidence becomes available.3,6 Much remains to be done and many questions remain unanswered. China is very grateful for the help it is receiving from the international scientific, health, and public health communities. The global society is more interconnected than ever, and emerging pathogens do not respect geopolitical boundaries. Proactive investment in public health infrastructure and capacity is crucial to effectively respond to epidemics like COVID-19, and it is critical to continue to improve international surveillance, cooperation, coordination, and communication about this major outbreak and to be even better prepared to respond to future new public health threats.\nBack to top\nArticle Information\nCorresponding Author: Zunyou Wu, MD, PhD, Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, 155 Changbai Rd, Beijing 102206, China (wuzy@263.net).\nPublished Online: February 24, 2020. doi:10.1001/jama.2020.2648\nConflict of Interest Disclosures: None reported.\nFunding/Support: This work was supported by the National Health Commission of the People\u2019s Republic of China (2018ZX10721102).\nRole of the Funder/Sponsor: The funder had no role in the preparation, review, or approval of the manuscript, or the decision to submit the manuscript for publication.\nDisclaimer: The opinions expressed herein reflect the collective views of the coauthors and do not necessarily represent the official position of the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention.\nAdditional Contributions: We thank China CDC Weekly for its permission to re-create the epidemic curve with modifications.\nReferences\n1.\nNovel Coronavirus Pneumonia Emergency Response Epidemiology Team.

In response, the Division of General Surgery at the University of Washington Department of Surgery in Seattle has designed and implemented an emergency restructuring of the facility\u2019s general surgery resident care teams in an attempt to optimize workforce well-being, comply with physical distancing requirements, and continue excellent patient care. This article introduces a unique approach to general surgery resident allocation by dividing patient care into separate inpatient care, operating care, and clinic care teams. Separate teams made up of all resident levels will work in each setting for a 1-week period. By creating this emergency structure, we have limited the number of surgery residents with direct patient contact and have created teams working in isolation from one another to optimize physical distancing while still performing required work. This also provides a resident reserve without exposure to the virus, theoretically flattening the curve among our general surgery resident cohort. Surgical resident team restructuring is critical during a pandemic to optimize patient care and ensure the well-being and vitality of the resident workforce while ensuring the entire workforce is not compromised.\nCoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has emerged as a global pandemic. As of March 31, 2020, there have been more than 850\u202f000 confirmed cases and an estimated 42\u202f000 deaths worldwide.1 The number of COVID-19\u2013associated fatalities in the US now exceeds 3800, and 210 deaths have occurred in the Seattle, Washington, area,2 making it an epicenter of the outbreak in the US.\nFor health care professionals on the front lines of care, it is only a matter of time before the workforce is affected by illness. At the University of Washington, in Seattle, we anticipate that some of the surgery resident house staff and faculty will eventually contract the virus. The current recommendation from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is 14 days of self-isolation for any confirmed COVID-19 infection that does not require hospitalization.3 The Washington State Department of Health mandates that anyone who had close contact with a patient with confirmed COVID-19 while not wearing proper personal protection equipment self-isolate at home for 14 days.4 This has the potential to put incredible strain on the health care system by limiting the number of clinicians available for patient care.\nIn an attempt to mitigate this scenario, the Division of General Surgery at the University of Washington Department of Surgery has implemented an emergency restructuring of our general surgery resident clinical teams. Our goal has been to minimize exposure to COVID-19 and protect our surgical resident workforce. To do this, we have limited the number of surgery residents with direct patient contact and have created independent resident physician teams that are isolated from one another, to create physical distancing in case of contagion among residents (Box).\nBox.\nThe Key Elements for a Functional Restructuring of a Surgical Residency During a Pandemic\nKey Points for a Successful Restructuring\nPhysical Distancing\nInterteam isolation\nIntrateam distancing\nVirtual handoffs and digital communication\nSpecified workstations\nVirtual rounding\nAssigned bedside rounds\nTeam Structure\nLarger teams\nFunctionally independent teams\nCapability to withstand member loss\nResidents of all levels per team\nMacrostructure\nSupplement members affected by illness or subject to self-isolation with research residents\nFluidity to deconstruct remaining large teams and reconstruct smaller teams as needed\nInclusion of at-home residents in the workforce\nConceptual Points\nResident and faculty buy-in\nSwift conception and assembly\nCommittee for the triaging and implementation of revisions\nWe began by critically analyzing 3 factors at each of our hospitals: the clinical surgical resident cohort, the clinical workload, and mandatory staffing needs. The clinical surgical resident cohort is the entire available general surgery resident workforce at a hospital at a single point; this provides us with the total number of residents at each level who can be deployed strategically in an emergency. The clinical workload consists of the entire inpatient, outpatient, and operative demands for a given week. Mandatory staffing needs are the subset of the clinical workload that requires residents for effective and safe patient care.\nOur previous team structure at one of our hospitals, the University of Washington Medical Center, consisted of 5 subspecialty general surgery teams with a mean of 4 residents each. Thus, any prolonged absence of even a single resident, as would be required for COVID-19 infection, would affect that entire team\u2019s ability to function safely and efficiently. However, the creation of larger teams would allow more resilience to team member absence. We thus proceeded to deconstruct the previous 5 daytime subspecialty teams and create 3 new larger teams called Alpha, Bravo, and Charlie. Each new team consisted of residents of all ranks, complemented by nurse practitioners. The clinical workload and mandatory staffing needs were similarly divided into 3 patient care domains: inpatient, operative, and clinic. A fourth facet of clinical care, the night care team, was kept intact and staffed by in-house night-float junior residents and a home-call senior resident.\nTeam Structure\nWe assigned the new teams to the patient care domains, aligning with our workload and staffing needs (Figure 1). Recognizing the need to isolate each care team to optimize physical distancing, the Alpha, Bravo, and Charlie teams were assigned to the following clinical duties, rotating every 7 days (Figure 2).\nInpatient Care\nThis team performs all inpatient clinical duties, including daily rounds, new consult staffing, admissions and discharges, and documentation. The senior resident on this service leads virtual rounds using medical record reviews of the patients and then assigns team members for bedside rounds based on clinical scenario. This minimizes the number of clinicians entering each patient room and eliminates groups of residents rounding in the traditional model. The senior resident also assigns individual residents to evaluate new consultations, with a goal of minimizing patient exposure for each individual resident.\nOperating Care\nThis team coordinates the operative care of patients and participates in the operations. These residents present directly to the operating room, perform the operations assigned, and then sign out operative patients to the inpatient care team. They do not visit other areas of the hospital or interact with other patients or clinicians. They are excluded from the resident team workroom to limit cross-contamination of teams.\nClinical Care\nThis team participates in outpatient clinics as needed. The University of Washington has adopted telehealth for most clinic visits during this time, and thus resident staffing in a clinic is rarely needed. As such, members of this team are placed into home-call status to isolate from the general population in the hospital, but they are available for clinic coverage or backup inpatient coverage as needed. They participate in daily virtual rounds and are available to input orders from home as needed.\nAdditional Insights\nWe elected not to modify our existing junior resident night-float structure; however, we modified our senior overnight home call to be made up of members from the inpatient care team. As such, these senior residents do not have overnight call duties during the other 2 weeks (during operating care and clinic care), thus minimizing overall time in the hospital. This also maximizes continuity of patient care, because the senior residents from the inpatient team care for the same patients overnight on call. The junior night-float structure was kept intact, because currently it is staffed by 2 junior residents who, except for times of handoffs, do not come into contact with any other residents. We have transitioned to virtual handoff methods, using technology to further limit resident interaction between the inpatient and night care teams.\nThere are certain factors that must be considered to create an effective restructuring during this pandemic. The teams must work in isolation from one another to encourage physical distancing, both between the different teams as well as within each team in the hospital setting. The 3 teams would theoretically never physically interact, thus preventing the spread of contagion from one team to another. Furthermore, we specified a computer workstation for each resident on the inpatient care teams (day and night) for the duration of the week, with a distance of 6 ft (2 m) to the next work station to provide these team members with as many aspects of physical distancing as possible while still in the hospital. The use of Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act\u2013compliant texting applications and other methods of digital communication between team members is critical to ensure safe transition of patient care while avoiding face-to-face contact. Moreover, the teams must be large enough to support an entire spectrum of patient care, whether it be in the inpatient, operating, or clinic settings. The larger size of these new teams also allows a buffer for the temporary loss of residents to infection, while maintaining overall functionality and self-sufficiency of the teams. Another important point to note is that as our outpatient clinic and elective operations workloads decrease, the clinic care team has been set up to functionally support the inpatient care team from home. This allows for a system that supports physical distancing while using the resident workforce that is not in house.\nIn the case of residents requiring self-isolation, we do not yet have adequate experience to know the outcome this will have on the clinical care teams. Since these teams are larger than the typical subspecialty teams at our institution, we anticipate that the workflow will be minimally affected, in that each larger team can better absorb the temporary loss of residents. We estimate each of these larger teams can function with a minimum of 4 residents. In the scenario in which an entire team is lost, our plan is to create 3 new teams from the residents on the remaining 2 teams and fortify them with research residents. Once the self-isolation period is over, a new cohort of residents would be ready to rejoin the workforce. We used the framework described herein to restructure the general surgery resident teams at the other hospitals within our system, customized for their specific needs.\nIt is important to note that although we went through several iterations and edits to these plans, we implemented this model within 48 hours of conception. Given the time sensitivity of the current state of emergency, we were forced to act quickly and decisively. Our plan is not perfect or a one-size-fits-all solution to the current crisis. However, we felt it wiser to implement a plan and make revisions on an as-needed basis rather than deliberate too long and risk compromising our surgical resident workforce.\nBack to top\nArticle Information\nAccepted for Publication: March 28, 2020.\nCorresponding Author: Amer H.

The ophthalmologist, who tried to alert his colleagues to this novel coronavirus and subsequently became an early victim of the disease, was among many thousands of health care workers who continue to struggle with limited resources to treat patients with COVID-19 while staving off an even larger pandemic. Lai et al1 describe another ongoing struggle at the COVID-19 epicenter, namely its consequences on the mental health of clinicians and other health care workers.\nSurveying more than 1200 nurses and physicians in 34 hospitals in the Wuhan region and across mainland China, the authors found striking prevalence rates of symptoms of depression and anxiety; half of those responding identified at least mild depression on a validated screening instrument, and one-third reported insomnia. Approximately 14% of physicians and nearly 16% of nurses described moderate or severe depressive symptoms. Those at greatest risk for depressive and anxious symptoms included women, those with intermediate seniority titles (compared with those with junior roles), and those at the center of the epidemic in Wuhan. These findings, consistent with those observed in the 2003 severe acute respiratory system (SARS) epidemic,2 may help to guide strategies for responding to mental health sequelae of this and future epidemics.\nUnsurprisingly for a report that completed data-gathering in 6 days and analysis in 4 weeks, Lai et al1 cannot answer important questions. What were the preexisting rates of psychopathology in this cohort? Are the consequences specific to being a health care worker or to simply living in the midst of an outbreak and potentially being subject to quarantine? As Camus wrote, \u201cThis sense of being abandoned, which might in time have given characters a finer temper, began, however, by sapping them to the point of futility.\u201d3 Perhaps most importantly, to what extent will these symptoms persist or worsen over time?\nWhile the peak of the COVID-19 epidemic remains to be seen, it will ultimately subside. The work of Lai et al1 provides a reminder of the toll that will likely linger: the consequences of chronic stress, including major depression and anxiety disorders. In a 3-year follow-up of a 2003 SARS outbreak,4 23% of health care workers reported moderate or greater depressive symptoms. This COVID-19 survey itself represents part of a massive effort by the Chinese government to contain disease fallout and address mental health. Nevertheless, just as the world has joined efforts to manage COVID-19 infection, it will be critical not to neglect the mental health consequences of the fight against the epidemic.\nAcross the world, physicians, nurses, and other frontline health care workers do heroic and lifesaving work in stressful settings on a daily basis. However, the toll that providing such care takes must also be recognized: sooner or later, every clinician is also a patient. Even outside epidemics, wars, and other public health crises, health care workers face mounting stresses, exacerbated by structural changes in medicine but ultimately reflecting the nature of the work itself.5 Such stresses far exceed the popular but imprecise concept of burnout.6 William Osler called the practice of medicine \u201ca calling, not a business; a calling in which your heart will be exercised equally with your head.\u201d Whether heart or head, Lai et al1 provide a reminder that such a calling is not without cost.\nBack to top\nArticle Information\nPublished: March 23, 2020. doi:10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2020.4006\nOpen Access: This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the CC-BY License. \u00a9 2020 Perlis RH.

Current reports show that SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV)1,2 and that it has a greater transmissibility than other coronaviruses. The confirmed transmission modes of SARS-CoV-2 include respiratory droplets and physical contact, and the incubation period for the virus is approximately 3 to 7 days, but it can be as long as 24 days.3 In this case series, we report a cluster-spreading event in Huai\u2019an (700 km northeast of Wuhan) in Jiangsu Province, China, in which a patient with SARS-CoV-2 may have transmitted the virus to 8 other healthy individuals via bathing in a public bath center.\nMethods\nData were collected from Huai\u2019an No. 4 Hospital of Jiangsu Province, China. A total of 9 patients who had been to the same bath center were hospitalized and enrolled from January 25, 2020, to February 10, 2020. Throat swab samples were collected, and SARS-CoV-2 was detected using a quantitative reverse transcription\u2013polymerase chain reaction assay. Computed tomography and hematological examinations were performed for auxiliary diagnoses. Data were analyzed with Prism version 7.00 (GraphPad). This study was approved by the ethics committee of Huai\u2019an No. 4 Hospital, and written informed consent was obtained from all patients. This study followed the reporting guideline for case series. No prespecified threshold for statistical significance was set.\nResults\nThe bath center for men was approximately 300 m2, with temperatures from 25 to 41 \u00b0C and humidity of approximately 60%. It contained a swimming pool, showers, and sauna. The first patient (patient 1) had traveled to Wuhan. He went to the bath center and showered on January 18, 2020. He started experiencing a fever on January 19, 2020, and was diagnosed with COVID-19 on January 25, 2020. The next 7 patients showered, used the sauna, and swam in the same center on January 19 (patients 2, 3, and 4), January 20 (patient 5), January 23 (patients 6 and 7), and January 24 (patient 8). The symptoms associated with COVID-19, including fever, cough, headache, and chest congestion, appeared between 6 and 9 days after visiting the bath center. Patient 9 was working in the bath center and experienced onset on January 30. Infection in all patients was confirmed by positive reverse transcription\u2013polymerase chain reaction assay results (Figure).\nThe median (interquartile range) age of the patients was 35 (24-50) years. A total of 8 patients (89%) reported fever (mean [SD] duration, 5.78 [2.99] days), and 7 patients (78%) reported a cough. Few patients (3 [33%]) showed debilitation, chest distress (2 [22%]), or anorexia (1 [11%]). Diarrhea, myalgia, rhinorrhea, and headache were not reported. C-reactive protein levels were elevated in 9 patients (100%; mean [SD], 3.34 [3.18] mg/dL; to convert to milligrams per liter, multiply by 10). Lymphopenia occurred in 3 patients (33%), lactate dehydrogenase was increased in 3 patients (33%; mean [SD], 225.56 [85.33] U/L; to convert to microkatals per liter, multiply by 0.0167), and glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase was increased in 2 patients (22%; mean [SD], 30.22 [13.94] U/L) (Table).\nComputed tomography examinations were performed, and the ground glass opacities were observed in all 9 patients. As of February 10, 2020, no patients required respiratory support.\nDiscussion\nPrevious studies have demonstrated that the transmission rate of a virus is significantly weakened in an environment with high temperature and humidity.4 However, judging from the results of this study, the transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 showed no signs of weakening in warm and humid conditions. We noticed a clustered case occurring in a public bath center with high temperature and humidity. A total of 8 individuals who used or worked in the bath center experienced symptoms within 6 to 9 days of their visit to the center, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 could spread and cause infection in such an environment. The transmission routes may also be respiratory droplets or contact, but our results suggest that the cluster transmission of SARS-CoV-2 can still arise in an environment with high temperature and humidity. These results provide a potential epidemiological clue for this novel coronavirus. This study was limited by a lack of detail regarding the transmission routes of the patients in the bath center.\nBack to top\nArticle Information\nAccepted for Publication: March 6, 2020.\nPublished: March 30, 2020. doi:10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2020.4583\nOpen Access: This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the CC-BY License. \u00a9 2020 Luo C et al.

Recent estimates from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention indicate that the rates of hospitalizations, intensive care unit admissions, and mortality among reported COVID-19 cases in the United States are substantially higher among patients older than 45 years compared with younger patients, with case-fatality rates exceeding 1.4% among patients aged 55 to 64 years and exceeding 2.7% among those aged 65 to 74 years.2\nThere are large numbers of older nurses and physicians, who, if they were not in the health care workforce, would be staying at home to minimize their risk of exposure. Instead, many older clinicians are reporting for work every day. These clinicians have decades of experience, knowledge, and decision-making skills that are crucially important to guide the wise use of scarce resources when treating patients, protecting coworkers, and ensuring the capabilities of health care delivery organizations. In this Viewpoint, to better understand the prevalence of older clinicians in the workforce, we briefly summarize the age distribution of physicians and nurses by employment setting and for the largest metropolitan areas in the United States, including areas particularly affected by COVID-19, including Seattle, Washington, and New York City.\nA substantial portion of hospital-based registered nurses, non\u2013hospital-based registered nurses, and physicians are 55 years of age or older (Figure). Among the nation\u2019s nearly 2 million registered nurses employed in hospitals, an estimated 370\u202f000 (19%) are aged 55 to 64 years, and an estimated 55\u202f000 (3%) are aged 65 years or older and thus, at even greater risk of complications and mortality from COVID-19. Of the approximately 1.2 million registered nurses employed outside of hospital settings, who could be called in to assist as hospital needs increase, even higher percentages are aged 55 to 64 years (24%) or aged 65 years or older (5%). The physician workforce is older still; of the approximately 1.2 million physicians in the United States, an estimated 230\u202f000 (20%) are aged 55 to 64 years and an estimated 106\u202f000 (9%) are aged 65 years or older.\nFigure.  Estimated Number of Full-time Equivalent Registered Nurses (RNs) and Physicians by Age Group\nView LargeDownload\nAuthors\u2019 analysis of data is sourced from the US Census Bureau American Community Survey 2014-2018, which reports pooled data representing a combined 5-in-100 national random sample of the US population (1% of the US population in each year).3 The sample includes all individuals who reported working with an occupation of physician or surgeon (N\u2009=\u200948\u202f538) or registered nurse (including nurse anesthetists and nurse practitioners [N\u2009=\u2009168\u202f801]). All estimates were weighted by sampling weights provided by the American Community Survey and represent full-time equivalent clinicians.\nAs the effects of COVID-19 are currently strongly regional, it is also important to consider how the ages of the nursing and physician workforces vary across the United States. There are considerable differences, and some of the areas with the most registered nurses and physicians aged 55 and older are among the most severely affected by the virus. The 25 largest US metropolitan areas, ranked by the percentage of the registered nurses and physicians in the workforce aged 55 years and older, is shown in the eTable in the Supplement.\nAmong registered nurses, the 25 areas range from nearly one-third (31.7%) aged 55 years and older in Boston, Massachusetts, to less than 1 in 5 (19.3%) in Miami, Florida. The top 3 ranked areas, in terms of having an older registered nurse workforce (including Camden, New Jersey, and East Long Island, New York), have had or are near sites of considerable COVID-19 infection (as of March 23, 2020). Regarding the physician workforce, there is even more variation between the area with the oldest physicians (Camden, New Jersey [38.9%]) and the youngest (Houston, Texas [19.4%]). Although areas with relatively older registered nurses do not necessarily have relatively older physicians, Camden, New Jersey, Fort Lauderdale, Florida, and Orange County, California, are among the top 5 areas with the oldest registered nurse and physician workforces.\nIt is reassuring that large numbers of older nurses and physicians are caring for patients today. These clinicians have decades worth of knowledge, experience, and relationships with coworkers that will be needed now more than ever when large numbers of patients are hospitalized with COVID-19. These clinician leaders are an essential and vitally important component of many organizations, especially because many of these older clinicians have experience with disasters, triaging, decision making, and managing staff and resources under times of great stress. Conversely, should these older nurses and physicians become infected and required to stay home, or if they become patients, the ramifications could be significant, not only in terms of the loss of their clinical expertise and presence when it is needed the most, but the loss of leadership, judgement, and maintaining morale.\nHospitals and other care delivery organizations, including state and local health departments, should carefully consider how best to protect and preserve their workforce, with careful consideration involving older physicians and nurses. Older clinicians are likely to have an even larger role in the months ahead as more regions address workforce shortages by requesting that retired physicians and nurses consider returning to the workforce during the COVID-19 outbreak, as has recently occurred in New York City, the state of Illinois, and Great Britain.4-6 While hospitals and other organizations ramp up their preparations, this is the time to determine whether there may be different roles for older clinicians that will ensure they are able to contribute over the long-term course of the pandemic. This is not to suggest that these older nurses and physicians should necessarily be precluded from providing clinical care or should be isolated, but rather to consider if their direct clinician duties can be shifted to emphasize roles with less risk of exposure. These roles may include various activities, such as consulting with younger staff, advising on the use of resources, being readily available for clinical and organizational problem solving, helping clinicians and managers make tough decisions, talking with families of patients, advising managers and executives, being public spokespersons, and liaising with public and community health organizations. In addition, hospitals will want to prepare for the effect that a severe illness or death of a colleague will have on their staff in terms of morale.\nAs the public, government, and the health care workforce prepare for what could be extraordinarily challenging weeks and months ahead, thought should be given on how to wisely use all health care resources, including the nation\u2019s nurse and physician workforce\u2014from students to the most seasoned.\nBack to top\nArticle Information\nCorresponding Author: Douglas O.

The pandemic is spreading at an exponential rate, with millions of people across the globe at risk of contracting SARS-CoV-2. Initial reports suggest that hypertension, diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases were the most frequent comorbidities in affected patients, and case fatality rates tended to be high in these individuals. In the largest Chinese study to date,1 which included 44\u202f672 confirmed cases, preexisting comorbidities that had high mortality rates included cardiovascular disease (10.5%), diabetes (7.3%), and hypertension (6.0%). Patients with such comorbidities are commonly treated with renin angiotensin system blockers, such as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs). However, the use of ACEIs/ARBs in patients with COVID-19 or at risk of COVID-19 infection is currently a subject of intense debate. Below, we outline the mechanisms by which ACEIs/ARBs may be of benefit in those with COVID-19, what the current recommendations are for their use in infected patients, and suggested areas for further research.\nSARS-CoV-2 uses the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) 2 receptor for entry into target cells. ACE2 is predominantly expressed by epithelial cells of the lung, intestine, kidney, heart, and blood vessels. Both ACE and ACE2 belong to the ACE family of dipeptidyl carboxydipeptidases and exert distinct physiological functions. ACE cleaves angiotensin I to angiotensin II, which in turn binds and activates angiotensin II receptor type 1. This activation leads to vasoconstrictive, proinflammatory, and pro-oxidative effects. In contrast, ACE2 also degrades angiotensin II to angiotensin 1-7 and angiotensin I to angiotensin 1-9. When angiotensin 1-9 binds to the Mas receptor, it leads to anti-inflammatory, antioxidative, and vasodilatory effects. It is important to note that 2 forms of ACE2 exists: a structural transmembrane protein with extracellular domain that serves as a receptor for spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 and a soluble form that represents the circulating ACE2. Understanding the relationship between SARS-CoV-2 and membranous and soluble ACE2 may help us better understand the adaptive or maladaptive processes operative in COVID-19 infection.\nAnimal (mice) studies have shown that expression of ACE2 is substantially increased in patients treated with ACEIs/ARBs.2,3 Similar to these observations, higher urinary ACE2 levels were seen in patients with hypertension treated with the ARB olmesartan. In another study,4 circulating ACE2 levels were increased in patients with diabetes treated with ACEIs. Based on these observations, some experts have speculated that use of ACEIs/ARBs leading to increased expression of ACE2 could potentially facilitate infection with COVID-19.\nA recent study by Liu et al5 showed that serum angiotensin II levels in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia was significantly higher compared with healthy individuals and were linearly associated with viral load and lung injury. Based on this, it can be postulated that SARS-CoV-2 binding to ACE2 may attenuate residual ACE2 activity, skewing the ACE/ACE2 balance to a state of heightened angiotensin II activity leading to pulmonary vasoconstriction and inflammatory and oxidative organ damage, which increases the risk for acute lung injury (ALI). Conceivably, renin angiotensin system modulation, either by ACEIs/ARBs or recombinant ACE2, leading to increased expression of ACE2 may help mitigate some of these deleterious effects of angiotensin II. It is also postulated that increased levels of soluble form of ACE2 may act as a competitive interceptor of SARS-CoV-2 and slow virus entry into the cells and protect from lung injury.6 Presently, to our knowledge, there are no clinical data on the utility of initiating ACEI/ARB therapy in treating patients with COVID-19. There is some evidence that ACEIs/ARBs may be beneficial in patients with ALI or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). In a meta-analysis of 37 studies,7 ACEIs and ARBs were associated with reduced risk of pneumonia and pneumonia-related mortality compared with control treatment. In a small double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial of 61 patients,8 those randomized to receive enalaprilat (up to 10 mg intravenously over 24 hours following a regimen based on blood pressure) had numerically higher ventilator-free days (12.3 vs 8.7 days; P\u2009=\u2009.18) and days alive outside the intensive care unit (8.9 vs 4.9 days; P\u2009=\u2009.09) compared with those randomized to placebo. The trial did not complete its intended sample size owing to slow enrollment. In a retrospective cohort study from Korea with 132 patients with ARDS,9 patients taking ACEIs/ARBs showed better survival compared with controls, albeit several confounding factors could have influenced the results. In a subgroup of patients with severe COVID-19, hyperinflammation and cytokine storm syndrome led to acute respiratory failure from ARDS. What drives such intense hyperinflammation is not yet known; however, through upregulation of ACE2, ACEIs/ARBs can exert anti-inflammatory and antioxidative effects, which may be beneficial in preventing ALI and ARDS.10 Based on the pathophysiology of SARS-CoV-2 infection and pleiotropic effects of ACEIs/ARBs, these agents may have a potential role in the management of select patients with severe COVID-19.\nSeveral professional societies have put forward their guidance regarding the use of ACEIs/ARBs in patients with COVID-19. In summary, all guidelines recommend continuing ACEIs/ARBs in patients with COVID-19 unless clinically indicated (Table). Furthermore, they do not suggest initiation of ACEIs/ARBs in those without another clinical indication (eg, hypertension, heart failure, diabetes), given the lack of strong evidence showing benefit of these medications in COVID-19. We agree with these recommendations, given the current state of evidence. However, the biological plausibility of salutary effects of ACEIs/ARBs in those with COVID-19 is intriguing. A multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 2 randomized clinical trial of starting losartan in patients with COVID-19 in outpatient settings (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT04311177) and in in-patient settings (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT04312009) is currently being planned. Accordingly, further epidemiological studies and prospective trials are urgently needed to investigate if use of ACEIs/ARBs can reduce the incidence or mortality associated with COVID-19\u2013associated ALI or ARDS, both in patients with and without additional clinical indications for ACEIs/ARBs.\nTable.

How children in the US will be affected is still mostly unknown. So far, proportionately fewer children have gotten sick in China, and the effects on them have mostly been mild. It is important for families to prepare for spread in the US.\nWho Is at Risk?\nCOVID-19 appears to be spread via respiratory secretions when infected people cough or sneeze, similar to how influenza (flu) spreads. Currently, people at risk for COVID-19 include those who have been in close contact with infected people within 14 days before their symptoms began. The average time from when persons are exposed to signs of illness is about 5 days and can range from 2 to 14 days. People with COVID-19 have fever, cough, muscle aches, headache, and diarrhea, which are all symptoms similar to other viral infections, such as the flu. People who need hospitalization usually have severe pneumonia. Currently, there are no treatments or vaccines available.\nWhat Should Families Do to Prepare?\nTalk to your children about how you are keeping them safe from COVID-19. Answer them in an open and honest way and try to manage any stress you may be feeling. Continue with your normal routine as much as possible. Be careful about rumors spreading in social media. Follow trusted sites (https://www.cdc.gov/) and news sources to learn about how your community is responding to COVID-19. Limit your children\u2019s exposure to media.\nAsk community leaders about plans for school closures and cancelling group events if COVID-19 is widespread. Talk to your workplace about teleworking options, and parents of students can ask about internet-based educational opportunities. Store at least a 2-week supply of food, water, and necessities such as diapers and refill your prescription medications and special equipment. Stock up on fever reducers (eg, acetaminophen [Tylenol]) and oral rehydration solutions (eg, Pedialyte).\nImportantly, teach children good handwashing techniques (using soap and water for at least 20 seconds) or use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer. Wash surfaces regularly with household cleaners. Children should be taught to cough or sneeze into their arm or elbow, not their hands, and to avoid touching their eyes, nose, or mouth. Keep children away from people who are sick. If your child gets sick, keep them home and call ahead to your physician to ask about next steps. Do not go to an emergency department unless you are having an emergency. If someone in your family becomes sick with COVID-19, follow guidance from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to decrease the chance of spreading.\nPrecautions for Children With Special Health Care Needs\nChildren with special health care needs, especially those with immune or neuromuscular problems, or with chronic illnesses, such as asthma, diabetes, or cancer, might be more likely to have complications from COVID-19. They might need to avoid crowds or large gatherings more than other children.\nFor More Information\nhttps://www.healthychildren.org/English/health-issues/conditions/chest-lungs/Pages/2019-Novel-Coronavirus.aspx\nhttps://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/guidance-prevent-spread.html\nhttps://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-nCoV/hcp/index.html\nhttps://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2020/02/28/809580453/just-for-kids-a-comic-exploring-the-new-coronavirus\nThe JAMA Pediatrics Patient Page is a public service of JAMA Pediatrics.

Technical challenges with the first test developed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) left the nation with minimal diagnostic capacity during the first few weeks of the epidemic. The CDC also initially limited access to testing to a narrow group of individuals with known exposure. The delayed discovery of a case of COVID-19 in California, followed quickly by evidence of community transmission in multiple states, revealed the shortcomings of this strategy. In the early stages, COVID-19 has spread beyond the nation\u2019s ability to detect it.\nOn February 29, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) moved to expand testing capacity by eliminating a requirement that advanced laboratories obtain prior FDA authorization before using their own, laboratory-developed tests.1 Then, on March 3, Vice President Pence announced the removal of all federal limits on testing, stating that \u201csubject to doctors\u2019 orders, any American can be tested.\u201d These steps left many with questions about what had happened with testing and what should happen next.\nUnraveling this situation requires understanding how the regulatory structure for diagnostic tests interacts with public health emergencies. It also involves appreciating the distinction between testing capacity for public health surveillance and clinical care. While the public may want extensive testing, the usefulness of testing is greater in some scenarios than others. It is important to balance 2 concepts: remedying testing gaps is imperative, yet more testing is not always better.\nUnderstanding the Testing Gap\nThe basis of diagnosis for new viruses is the reverse transcriptase\u2013polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test used to identify genetic material in many clinical samples. The CDC developed a protocol for RT-PCR that included specific primers designed to bind to key areas of the novel coronavirus. FDA authorized CDC\u2019s test via an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA),2 through which the FDA permits use of a non\u2013FDA-approved drug or device to respond to a declared emergency. The CDC quickly shipped the test to state and local public health laboratories given the urgent need to support public health surveillance by identifying new cases around the country.\nThe CDC test differed in some respects from a test developed at the same time by the Robert Koch Institute in Germany and adopted by the World Health Organization (WHO). As soon as the test kits arrived, however, many state laboratories encountered difficulty verifying the results; some of the expected results came back as inconclusive or invalid due to failure of the negative control. The source of these problems remains under investigation.\nThe RT-PCR test is performed in many laboratories across the country for a variety of different clinical diagnoses, and laboratories could have tested using WHO\u2019s recommended protocol and primers. However, FDA made clear that laboratories were encouraged to develop tests but could not use them for clinical diagnosis without FDA\u2019s \u201capproval, clearance, or authorization during an emergency declaration.\u201d3\nOn February 24, recognizing that inadequate access to testing was hindering response efforts, frustrated state laboratories asked FDA for permission to develop and use their own tests. FDA initially directed the state laboratories first to submit an EUA application, but reversed course within days under growing pressure to expand testing capacity for patient care.\nOn February 29, FDA began permitting coronavirus testing using laboratory-developed tests without prior agency approval.1 Laboratories certified to perform high-complexity testing could begin testing patient samples using their own tests after showing that they took certain basic steps to validate them, so long as the laboratories submitted an EUA application within 15 days. Since the FDA announcement, the New York State laboratory announced it had received an EUA to test for the novel coronavirus. As of March 5, other laboratories are expected to begin testing soon, and it is anticipated that testing will be far more available nationwide by mid-March.\nRegulation of Laboratory-Developed Tests in an Emergency\nTesting for SARS-CoV-2 highlights a controversial area of public policy\u2014the regulation of laboratory-developed tests\u2014in which there has long been tension between the goals of access and quality. Outside of emergency contexts, FDA largely does not regulate laboratory-developed tests, leaving major gaps in oversight of test accuracy and validity. (The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services regulates the quality of laboratory operations and certain aspects of the analytical validity of laboratory-developed tests.) In 2014, during the Obama administration, FDA proposed but did not finalize draft guidance that would have required laboratories to submit evidence to the agency for certain high-risk tests. The Trump administration did not proceed with this effort, and in recent years, the debate over regulation of laboratory-developed tests has shifted to Congress, most recently in draft legislation called the Verifying Accurate, Leading-edge IVCT Development (VALID) Act.4\nDuring declared emergencies, the regulatory terrain for laboratory-developed tests is different. In such circumstances, under the Project Bioshield Act of 2004, FDA has broad discretion about which laboratory tests can be used for the response. For the novel coronavirus, FDA chose to limit the initial approval to the CDC test for the purpose of ensuring accurate surveillance testing by state and local public health laboratories.3 The failure of this test, however, put into sharp relief the risks of this strategy: inadequate capacity to conduct surveillance, as well as a challenge to scale up quickly should the test be needed broadly for clinical care. Evidence suggests that containment of COVID-19 may depend on early case detection and contact tracing.5 It is notable that an administration that chose not to proceed with greater oversight of laboratory-developed tests absent an emergency also chose to restrict testing substantially in the case of coronavirus, even after professional societies expressed concerns in 2016 about access to testing in an emergency.6\nWhile the latest FDA action to permit some testing prior to review is understandable under the difficult circumstances, this policy has introduced its own risks. It will be critical for FDA to identify and quickly address any testing errors by laboratories and review EUA applications quickly. The agency should also reassess the new approach as testing becomes more available and transparently review its experience to develop future policy for public health emergencies.\nWho Should Be Tested?\nThe current situation exemplifies the challenge of how to best utilize testing during outbreaks of novel pathogens. The initial testing criteria were too narrow to monitor and control the spread of the disease, but the sudden pivot to a far broader testing approach, even as capacity remains limited, may be an overcorrection. As of March 4, CDC discontinued specific guidance and recommends that \u201c[c]linicians should use their judgment to determine if a patient has signs and symptoms compatible with COVID-19 and whether the patient should be tested,\u201d advising that \u201c[d]ecisions on which patients receive testing should be based on the local epidemiology of COVID-19, as well as the clinical course of illness.\u201d7\nHigh priorities for testing include patients with serious, unexplained respiratory illness and contacts of known cases. In March 2020, numerous patients with mild, nonspecific symptoms of COVID-19 have called for testing in clinic offices and on social media. There is a risk that widespread testing and test-seeking will overwhelm medical services needed for patients who have more severe symptoms. Furthermore, once in a waiting room for a test, a patient with mild or no illness may actually be exposed to the coronavirus from infected patients.\nA related concern is misunderstanding results. Given the disease\u2019s incubation period (estimated as 2-14 days), a negative result does not rule out infection, particularly for people with a known exposure. A positive result in an otherwise well or mildly ill patient does not require urgent medical attention but does require isolation at this time. Accurate communications will be essential to avoid confusion.\nInnovative approaches to testing, such as drive-through testing, should be considered. But testing is not a substitute for other steps to control the spread of the virus, such as handwashing, isolation when indicated, and appropriate social distancing measures.\nConclusion\nDiagnostic testing is critical to an effective response to the novel coronavirus. As the US moves to make up for initial missteps, emerging evidence should guide policy and practice. The public health and medical communities should recognize the need to alter policy to fit changing circumstances and support consistent and compassionate messaging that recognizes both the benefits and limitations of testing.\nBack to top\nArticle Information\nCorresponding Author: Joshua M.

Reverse transcriptase\u2013polymerase chain reaction results were positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 in 28 nasopharyngeal swabs and 2 conjunctival swabs, and more significant changes in blood test values appeared in patients with ocular abnormalities.\nMeaning  These data may assist ophthalmologists and others to understand the ocular manifestations of COVID-19, thus enhancing the diagnosis and prevention of the transmission of the disease.\nAbstract\nImportance  While the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has resulted in more than 100\u202f000 infected individuals in China and worldwide, there are few reports on the association of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) with ocular abnormalities. Understanding ocular manifestations of patients with COVID-19 by ophthalmologists and others may facilitate the diagnosis and prevention of transmission of the disease.\nObjective  To investigate ocular manifestations and viral prevalence in the conjunctiva of patients with COVID-19.\nDesign, Setting, and Participants  In this case series, patients with COVID-19 treated from February 9 to 15, 2020, at a hospital center in Hubei province, China, were retrospectively reviewed for ocular manifestations. During the period of treatment, the ocular signs and symptoms as well as results of blood tests and reverse transcriptase\u2013polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) from nasopharyngeal and conjunctival swabs for SARS-CoV-2 were noted and analyzed.\nMain Outcomes and Measures  Ocular signs and symptoms as well as results of blood tests and RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2.\nResults  Of the 38 included patients with clinically confirmed COVID-19, 25 (65.8%) were male, and the mean (SD) age was 65.8 (16.6) years. Among them, 28 patients (73.7%) had positive findings for COVID-19 on RT-PCR from nasopharyngeal swabs, and of these, 2 patients (5.2%) yielded positive findings for SARS-CoV-2 in their conjunctival as well as nasopharyngeal specimens. A total of 12 of 38 patients (31.6%; 95% CI, 17.5-48.7) had ocular manifestations consistent with conjunctivitis, including conjunctival hyperemia, chemosis, epiphora, or increased secretions. By univariate analysis, patients with ocular symptoms were more likely to have higher white blood cell and neutrophil counts and higher levels of procalcitonin, C-reactive protein, and lactate dehydrogenase than patients without ocular symptoms. In addition, 11 of 12 patients with ocular abnormalities (91.7%; 95% CI, 61.5-99.8) had positive results for SARS-CoV-2 on RT-PCR from nasopharyngeal swabs. Of these, 2 (16.7%) had positive results for SARS-CoV-2 on RT-PCR from both conjunctival and nasopharyngeal swabs.\nConclusions and Relevance  In this study, one-third of patients with COVID-19 had ocular abnormalities, which frequently occurred in patients with more severe COVID-19. Although there is a low prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in tears, it is possible to transmit via the eyes.\nIntroduction\nSince December 2019, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been reported among patients in China. Currently, the disease is quickly spreading worldwide. The pathogen of COVID-19 is a novel coronavirus (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 [SARS-CoV-2]), identified as a member of the Coronaviridae family. Another coronavirus, named SARS-CoV-1, was responsible for severe acute respiratory syndrome.1 Compared with SARS-CoV-1, SARS-CoV-2 has a similar binding receptor and similar pathologic features systemically and epidemiological characteristics.1,2 Although there is no direct evidence that SARS-CoV-1 replication results in conjunctivitis and other ocular diseases, reports have emphasized the eye as a potential site for virus transmission.3 Similarly, SARS-CoV-2 transmission through the eye has been suspected.\nNevertheless, there are no reports in the medical literature at this time, to our knowledge, that identify a direct relationship between SARS-CoV-2 and the eye. Researchers have not reported ocular abnormalities nor have they stated in the medical literature if there was conjunctivitis or viral presence detected in the tears of patients with COVID-19. The objective of this study was to evaluate ocular involvement systematically in patients highly suspected of having or confirmed to have COVID-19.\nMethods\nFrom February 9 to 15, 2020, patients with COVID-19 hospitalized in Yichang Central People\u2019s Hospital were diagnosed based on the 5th edition of the National Guideline on Prevention and Control of the Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia (PC-NCP) published by the National Health Commission of China on February 8, 2020.4 The patient symptoms, ocular manifestations, chest computed tomographic scans, and results of blood tests and reverse transcriptase\u2013polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) from nasopharyngeal and conjunctival swabs for SARS-CoV-2 were noted and analyzed. This study was approved by the ethics committee of Yichang Central People\u2019s Hospital, and all patients gave written informed consent. All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS version 13.0 (SPSS Inc). Means for continuous variables were compared using independent-group t test when the data were normally distributed; otherwise, the Mann-Whitney test was used. Proportions for categorical variables were compared using the \u03c72 and Fisher exact test as appropriate. For unadjusted comparisons, a 2-sided \u03b1 of less than .05 was considered statistically significant.\nResults\nOf the 38 consecutive patients with COVID-19 who were recruited, 25 (65.8%) were male, and the mean (SD) age was 65.8 (16.6) years (Table 1). Among them, 28 patients (73.7%) had positive findings for COVID-19 on RT-PCR from nasopharyngeal swabs, and of these, 2 patients (5.2%) yielded positive findings for SARS-CoV-2 in their conjunctival as well as nasopharyngeal specimens. The other 10 patients who were hospitalized were judged to have COVID-19 by the guideline of PC-NCP,4 with fever and/or respiratory symptoms and lung computed tomography imaging features of COVID-19 pneumonia.\nA total of 12 of 38 patients (31.6%; 95% CI, 17.5-48.7) had ocular manifestations consistent with conjunctivitis, including conjunctival hyperemia, chemosis, epiphora, and increased secretions (Table 2). Among these 12 patients, there were 4 cases judged as moderate, 2 cases judged as severe, and 6 cases judged as critical, which was graded according to the guideline of PC-NCP4: moderate indicated fever and/or respiratory symptoms and lung computed tomography imaging findings; severe indicated dyspnea (respiratory frequency of 30 cycles per minute or greater), blood oxygen saturation of 93% or less, and an arterial partial pressure of oxygen to fraction of oxygen inspiration ratio of 300 or less; and critical indicated respiratory failure or shock or multiple organ dysfunction/failure.4 In these patients, 1 patient experienced epiphora as the first symptom of COVID-19. None of them experienced blurred vision. By univariate analysis, patients with ocular symptoms were more likely to have higher white blood cell and neutrophil counts and higher levels of procalcitonin, C-reactive protein, and lactate dehydrogenase than patients without ocular symptoms (Table 1). In addition, 11 of 12 patients with ocular abnormalities (91.7%; 95% CI, 61.5-99.8) had positive results for SARS-CoV-2 on RT-PCR from nasopharyngeal swabs. Of these, 2 (16.7%) had positive results for SARS-CoV-2 on RT-PCR from both conjunctival and nasopharyngeal swabs.\nDiscussion\nFew previous investigations have evaluated ocular signs and symptoms in patients infected with SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2. A few reports have evaluated for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in tear fluid.3,5 Our investigation suggests that among patients with COVID-19, 31.6% (95% CI, 17.5-48.7) have ocular abnormalities, with most among patients with more severe systemic manifestations or abnormal findings on blood tests. These results suggest that ocular symptoms commonly appear in patients with severe pneumonia.\nOur results show a low prevalence (5.2%; 95% CI, 0.6-17.8) of SARS-CoV-2 nucleotides in conjunctival specimens of patients with COVID-19, consistent with previous studies on severe acute respiratory syndrome.3 Of note, we found only 1 patient presenting with conjunctivitis as the first symptom. Previous reports have shown the shedding of potentially infectious virus can occur in people who have no fever and minor or absent signs of infection.6 Because unprotected eyes were associated with an increased risk of transmission of SARS-CoV-1,7 in support of our current results, our results might suggest that SARS-CoV-2 might be transmitted through the eye.\nLimitations of this study include a relatively small sample size and absence of detailed ocular examinations to exclude intraocular disease owing to the logistical challenges of managing these patients at this time. In addition, we only sampled once from the eye of each patient, which can decrease the prevalence owing to false-negatives. Regardless, these preliminary results are shared in an effort to inform ophthalmologists and others around the world regarding ocular symptoms with COVID-19.\nBack to top\nArticle Information\nAccepted for Publication: March 17, 2020.\nPublished Online: March 31, 2020. doi:10.1001/jamaophthalmol.2020.1291\nOpen Access: This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the CC-BY License. \u00a9 2020 Wu P et al.

A total of 28\u202f130 cases in mainland China and 22 cases in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) have been confirmed as of February 6, 2020, with a reported epidemic doubling time of 6.4 days.1 The early reported mortality rate of 4.3%2 appears to be lower than that of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome, but this initial figure is believed likely to be an underestimation, as most of the confirmed patients are still inpatients, and their condition is not yet resolved.\nThe first fatality of a physician documented globally was that of an otolaryngology physician in Wuhan on January 25, 2020, whose situation was similar to that of an otolaryngologist who died of SARS in the HKSAR in 2003. Thus, it is imperative that otolaryngologists and physicians globally stay abreast of this outbreak and appreciate essential precautionary practices that are potentially crucial in protecting themselves and patients during this epidemic. In many regions globally, including China and the HKSAR, it is a very common practice for patients with upper respiratory tract infections to seek family practitioners and otolaryngologists as a primary care physician. Such a practice inadvertently poses inherent risks for physicians examining patients potentially carrying the virus. The route of transmission has yet to be firmly established. However, based on current evidence, it is speculated that respiratory droplets and possibly fecal-oral routes are culprits, similar to the SARS epidemic in 2003.3,4\nThe association of COVID-19 with clinical services to the public has been severely disruptive, as redistribution of manpower and resources are required to critically meet the current and anticipated hospital service needs during the outbreak. There has been a reduction in elective clinics and operations to mobilize manpower to acute specialties combatting the outbreak and maximize hospital beds numbers available in anticipation of the outbreak. There is also understandably fear from the public in visiting hospitals. Both factors have resulted in a more than 50% reduction in daily patient visits to our specialist clinic. Although essential emergency and oncologic surgeries are still proceeding as usual, contingency plans are in place to reluctantly reduce such services if the outbreak becomes critical and significant. This rapid change in clinic provisions and rescheduling of patients causes substantial inconvenience to patients and potentially poses a risk with delayed assessments but is a necessity given the gravity of the current situation.\nAn area of particular concern in our field is aerosol-generating procedures that would include open systems for tracheostomies and possibly the performance of flexible laryngoscopy. With the current COVID-19 outbreak in our region and the previous experiences from SARS, all outpatient clinic patients are seen with otolaryngology physicians mandatorily wearing at a minimum an N95 respirator, gown, cap, eye protection, and gloves.5 This personal protective equipment (PPE) setting is inevitably cumbersome and uncomfortable. However, with substantial presymptomatic carriers of the virus having a mean incubation period of 5.2 days (with 95% of the distribution at 12.5 days),6 such PPE precautionary practices are an absolute necessity.\nOur clinic layout has also been adjusted to facilitate a separate gown-up and gown-down area to prevent cross-contamination of practicing clinical areas. All patients attending the outpatient clinic department must have their body temperatures checked on arrival. Acknowledging the fact that many presymptomatic patients may not be febrile despite being COVID-19 carriers, we assess recent travel histories of all patients attending the clinic to facilitate them being seen in the accident and emergency departments as needed.\nOur patient wards are open wards containing cubicles of 6 patients. Patients with a tracheostomy are all now covered with a closed system identical to when a patient is connected to a mechanical ventilator. This is to minimize the aerosol generated that could cross-contaminate the surrounding patients and health care workers given the suction requirements of these patients. All bedside procedures are performed in a separate treatment room away from patient cubicles with all health care workers wearing PPE as in our clinics.\nThrough all these changes in outpatient clinics and inpatient services, we are actively limiting the number of procedures performed and patients seen who are triaged as clinically nonurgent. Such practices help to eliminate unnecessary exposure and contamination at clinics, but this also results in delayed assessments for these patients, and ultimately it also adds a burden to the system because all of these patients must still be seen after the epidemic has settled.\nThe importance of our experience is that with the high risk of substantial exportation of asymptomatic patients globally, the risk of self-sustaining outbreaks globally appears inevitable, in particular in regions with close travel links with China. It is essential that these set measures and precautionary plans are readily available for use globally to fundamentally protect physicians during this epidemic in a timely manner. Otolaryngologists are at particularly high risk even when performing routine procedures and ought to be extra vigilant given the global footprint of the virus.\nBack to top\nArticle Information\nCorresponding Authors: Jason Y.

State and local public health emergency declarations are also likely. During crises, government has a special responsibility to thoughtfully balance public health protections and civil liberties.\nPublic Health Risk Assessment\nWhile epidemiological data are evolving, human-to-human transmission of COVID-19 has been documented over an incubation period of 2 to 14 days.2 Based on available data, the case fatality rate appears lower than that associated with other novel coronaviruses (severe acute respiratory syndrome [SARS] and Middle East respiratory syndrome [MERS]), likely no more than 2%. China has reported the majority of cases and deaths, especially in Wuhan and surrounding Hubei Province. The US population currently is at low risk, but infections could escalate if sustained transmission occurs. Absent rapid diagnostic tests, effective vaccines, or antiviral medications, health officials are focused on identifying cases and separating persons exposed or infected.\nEmergency Health Powers\nEmergency declarations enhance national or regional response capabilities through limited liability protections for first responders and volunteers; reciprocal licensure requirements; and real-time development and acquisition of countermeasures (eg, vaccines, antivirals, medical equipment). Hospitals that have staffing or supply shortages can shift to crisis standards of care.3 Declarations also expedite public health powers to test, screen, or isolate individuals and restrict travel.\nThe US Constitution grants primary public health powers to the states, which they may delegate to localities. Narrower federal health powers historically center on preventing spread of infectious diseases into the US or across states. However, the HHS has exercised federal powers in response to COVID-19 beyond those used for previous health emergencies such as SARS, H1N1 influenza, and Ebola. The administration premised the exercise of federal powers on the need to avert \u201ccascading public health, economic, national security, and societal consequences.\u201d4\nTravel Warnings and Recall of Nonessential Personnel\nImmediately following the emergency declaration of the HHS, federal agencies implemented travel warnings, entry bans, and border protections. On January 31, the State Department issued its strongest warning (\u201cdo not travel\u201d) applying to mainland China.5 Additional warnings may take effect with \u201clittle or no advance notice.\u201d5 Nonessential diplomatic, military, and other personnel in affected regions are being called back. Customs and Border Protection agents are actively screening persons for signs of illness at ports of entry, separating those exposed to, or infected with, COVID-19.\nFlights Suspended or Rerouted\nDirect flights from China have been rerouted to select US airports for enhanced screening and self-quarantine up to 14 days. Major airlines have temporarily suspended flights to and from China. Even after declaring a public health emergency of international concern, the World Health Organization urged air carriers to resume flights given potential adverse effects on international travel and commerce.\nBan on Non-US Nationals\nFederal authorities have banned non-US nationals visiting mainland China in the prior 2 weeks from US entry.3 Exceptions include lawful residents, noncitizen spouses, and persons determined not to pose a significant risk. Yet, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has not stated a discernable standard for conducting risk assessments. The Department of Homeland Security plans to remove noncitizens circumventing entry rules through \u201cfraud, willful misrepresentation of a material fact, or illegal entry.\u201d4 Customs and Border Protection officers are checking passengers\u2019 travel histories to identify those who have recently visited China.\nEvacuations and Quarantines\nThe CDC ordered a 14-day quarantine of nearly 200 US citizens evacuated from Wuhan at a military base in California on January 31. The Department of Defense has approved additional quarantine facilities at military bases for other evacuees.6 Federal authorities also announced mandatory quarantines for any person entering the US who has recently visited Hubei province.\nLawfulness of Quarantine Powers\nThe federal Public Health Services Act authorizes the CDC to detain, medically examine, and quarantine persons traveling into the US or between states suspected of carrying specific communicable diseases.7 For decades, the CDC\u2019s direct use of its powers lied dormant. In 2017, however, the CDC expanded its powers coupled with modest due process safeguards.8 Its rule stressed interjurisdictional coordination, recognizing the primary public health powers of states and the availability of medical isolation facilities.\nUnder the rule, CDC agents can initially apprehend persons suspected or known to be infected with specified communicable diseases for up to 72 hours. Medical testing, consensual treatment, modes of communication, and other accommodations must be offered at the government\u2019s expense (unless health insurers are obligated to pay).8\nFollowing initial apprehension, the CDC can quarantine suspected cases or isolate infected persons pursuant to due process protections, including access to independent medical experts, legal counsel, and outside witnesses. CDC agents must also determine whether less-restrictive alternatives to separation and confinement are available. Although meaningful, these due process measures are constitutionally insufficient. The Supreme Court requires \u201cclear and convincing\u201d evidence (not reasonable beliefs) for civil confinements, with the right to appeal to independent tribunals.8 Under the CDC\u2019s rule, individual appeals are handled through internal agency reviews although anyone deprived of liberty has the right to petition courts for habeas corpus.\nEvaluating Compulsory Powers\nCompulsory public health powers should be evaluated and justified under a common legal and ethical standard, including (1) individuals must pose a significant risk of spreading a dangerous, infectious disease; (2) interventions must be likely to ameliorate risks; (3) least-restrictive means necessary to achieve public health objectives are required; (4) use of coercion should be proportionate to the risk; and (5) assessments must be based on the best available scientific evidence. In emerging crises when the science is uncertain, adoption of the \u201cprecautionary principle\u201d is reasonable to ensure public safety. Yet, health emergencies do not warrant coercion that is indiscriminate, overbroad, excessive, or without evidentiary support.\nEntry bans of non-US nationals are overbroad because there is no individualized risk assessment. Enhanced screening, monitoring, and social distancing are less-restrictive means to achieve the public health objective. The World Health Organization officially recommends against widespread travel restrictions under the International Health Regulations, including the US entry ban.\nQuarantines of evacuees or other passengers arriving from Hubei province may be justified under the precautionary principle. Hubei is currently a \u201chot zone\u201d of contagion where individuals have significant risks of exposure. The quarantine period also is justified by epidemiologic data placing the outer limit of asymptomatic transmission at 14 days.\nQuarantines of passengers arriving from mainland China appear excessive and are inconsistent with available epidemiologic data. While there are mounting cases outside Hubei, most passengers from mainland China have not been exposed to infection, suggesting that quarantines are overinclusive. Less-restrictive alternatives, such as enhanced screening and active monitoring, could ameliorate risks to the US population.\nSelf-monitoring and home quarantines are effective public health tools. During prior infectious disease emergencies, states have ordered exposed individuals to remain in their personal residences and self-monitor for early signs of infection. Thousands of US residents who have returned from China are already sheltering at home. When rigorously implemented (including regular check-ins, health care worker visits, and social support), home quarantine orders are lawful, effective, and more respectful of individual rights to liberty and privacy than restrictive, off-site measures.\nThis is a critical juncture in the COVID-19 epidemic, when community transmission can be prevented. Affording public health departments with the resources needed to implement evidence-based strategies is essential. A sound response starts with science, voluntarism, and civic responsibility. Coercive measures could be counterproductive and erode public trust and cooperation. Effective public health interventions that delay the spread of COVID-19 would allow time to develop key biomedical technologies, possibly including vaccines.\nBack to top\nArticle Information\nCorresponding Author: Lawrence O.

We are witnessing an advanced health system stretched beyond its capacity. When the capacity of the system is exceeded, rationing decisions may need to be made that extend well beyond patients with COVID-19. On March 11, the Italian College of Anesthesia, Analgesia, Resuscitation, and Intensive Care was forced to publish guidelines for rationing care. Infectious disease and epidemiology experts1 have been outlining the worst-case scenarios possible with the unchecked spread of a novel virus, both in terms of immunity and preparedness. Unfortunately, hospital systems are designed for average patient loads, not epidemics. Observations from Italy demonstrate what is at stake. When containment fails, the exponential growth of cases can transform a public health emergency into an operational crisis.\nWhat Can We Learn?\nOperationally, what can be gleaned from the dire situation in Italy to avoid a similar fate in other countries? The geographic and temporal clustering of outbreaks can overwhelm a health care system. Most Italian cases and deaths have been concentrated in the northern region of Lombardy, which should concern US states working to manage their own clusters, including Washington and New York. President Trump has imposed sweeping travel restrictions on visitors from China and Europe, but these restrictions will have little effect in US regions with widespread community transmission. Public containment measures implemented in recent days will take a week or longer to have an effect; with an incubation period of 2 to 7 days2 and a wait for test results of 2 to 3 days, new cases reflect infections from more than a week ago.\nPatients with severe disease from COVID-19 require a mean of approximately 13 days of respiratory support.2 Such lengthy treatment time will further stress resources. This time in the system multiplied by the arrival rate (known as Little\u2019s law) is a simple but elegant formula for modeling system capacity before a queue develops. In manufacturing or customer service, queues may result in decreased profitability and/or the loss of customers; in critical care medicine, queues can be deadly. For example, take a large hospital with 100 beds in the intensive care unit. Assume that at any given time, 70% of these beds are occupied.3 The remaining 30 beds are the effective extra capacity to absorb patients with COVID-19. Because of the long treatment time (approximately 13 days), the number of new patients that can be accommodated per day during an extended outbreak is low. Admitting more than 2.3 patients per day (30 beds divided by 13 days) with respiratory failure will lead to an unstable system and queues. Italy reported 7087 new cases during a 2-day period between March 14 and March 15, 2020. With as many as 15% of documented infections resulting in severe disease,2 rationing decisions may quickly be required.\nHow Can We Prepare?\nBy observing regional outbreaks in the context of Italy\u2019s case growth, we can start to model and anticipate both what the ultimate capacity to provide care will be and when that capacity will be exceeded. Case growth rates of 25% to 35% per day are commonplace among affected regions. Based on trends in known cases in a specific locale, we can start to model caseloads under different scenarios. Tools designed for influenza epidemics, such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention FluSurge, can offer useful estimates. Preparations for expanding capacity should already be underway to address growing regional clusters of transmission (ie, so-called hotspots). Many hospitals have mass casualty protocols for catastrophic events; the COVID-19 response could require an equal mobilization of staff and resources but during a sustained period. Nearby hospital systems should communicate early and often, given that efficient case sharing and transport between hospitals could become essential. Regional networking among 15 hospitals was part of Lombardy\u2019s early response to the massive surge of patients with COVID-19 while individual hospitals increased capacity.4\nBed capacity may not be the most crucial bottleneck for providing critical care. Observing Italy, experts are rightly concerned about the fixed number of ventilators. However, there are many other key factors to consider. Given the risk of health care worker infection5 and quarantine, will there be enough staff to provide care? Are there sufficient drug supplies for effective respiratory and cardiovascular support? Are there adequate supplies of personal protective equipment? Hospitals have prided themselves on the efficiency that comes with just-in-time supply management and minimizing empty beds, but as a result, they may be ill equipped for an epidemic surge.\nHospital administrators need to start preparing for worst case scenarios now, and thankfully, most are doing so. Toner and Waldhorn6 have assembled a comprehensive list of preventive actions. This planning and response will require a multidisciplinary effort; physicians, nurses, respiratory therapists, pharmacists, environmental services staff, supply chain managers, and many others possess needed expertise. Messaging from hospital leadership must be communicated often and clearly. The protection of staff from infection must remain a high priority.\nWhat Lies Ahead?\nSome countries, such as Taiwan,7 have been successful at combating the virus through aggressive testing and containment measures. South Korea, while initially inundated with patients from a rapidly spreading cluster, has successfully mitigated spread (at least temporarily) with minimal associated mortality. These examples provide encouragement that a well-executed public health response can minimize the potential for operational crises. The common themes in success have been massive testing, adaptive policy recommendations for different regions, and communication by public officials that is constant, transparent, and honest. The public needs to trust public officials and see the good and bad news every day.\nIn our interconnected world, the life-and-death consequences of health care needs exceeding the system\u2019s capacity could hit any region at any time. It is imperative to learn the lessons of Italy and Hubei, China: waiting until an exponentially increasing epidemic becomes self-evident will ensure that draconian efforts will be required for control, and even with these measures, there will be a significant loss of life. Actions taken now by society and health care systems will determine whether history regards 2020 as a great public health achievement or an epic failure of our public health and health care infrastructure.\nArticle Information\nCorrection: This article was corrected on March 20, 2020, to fix errors in the authors\u2019 degrees and affiliations.\nCorresponding Author: Joseph Cavallo, MD, Yale Radiology and Biomedical Imaging, 330 Cedar St, TE 2-214, New Haven, CT 06520 (Joseph.Cavallo@yale.edu).\nConflict of Interest Disclosures: None reported.\nReferences\n1.\nWu  Z, McGoogan  JM.

Health care workers in hospitals equipped with fever clinics or wards for patients with COVID-19 were eligible.\nMain Outcomes and Measures  The degree of symptoms of depression, anxiety, insomnia, and distress was assessed by the Chinese versions of the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire, the 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale, the 7-item Insomnia Severity Index, and the 22-item Impact of Event Scale\u2013Revised, respectively. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to identify factors associated with mental health outcomes.\nResults  A total of 1257 of 1830 contacted individuals completed the survey, with a participation rate of 68.7%. A total of 813 (64.7%) were aged 26 to 40 years, and 964 (76.7%) were women. Of all participants, 764 (60.8%) were nurses, and 493 (39.2%) were physicians; 760 (60.5%) worked in hospitals in Wuhan, and 522 (41.5%) were frontline health care workers. A considerable proportion of participants reported symptoms of depression (634 [50.4%]), anxiety (560 [44.6%]), insomnia (427 [34.0%]), and distress (899 [71.5%]). Nurses, women, frontline health care workers, and those working in Wuhan, China, reported more severe degrees of all measurements of mental health symptoms than other health care workers (eg, median [IQR] Patient Health Questionnaire scores among physicians vs nurses: 4.0 [1.0-7.0] vs 5.0 [2.0-8.0]; P\u2009=\u2009.007; median [interquartile range {IQR}] Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale scores among men vs women: 2.0 [0-6.0] vs 4.0 [1.0-7.0]; P\u2009<\u2009.001; median [IQR] Insomnia Severity Index scores among frontline vs second-line workers: 6.0 [2.0-11.0] vs 4.0 [1.0-8.0]; P\u2009<\u2009.001; median [IQR] Impact of Event Scale\u2013Revised scores among those in Wuhan vs those in Hubei outside Wuhan and those outside Hubei: 21.0 [8.5-34.5] vs 18.0 [6.0-28.0] in Hubei outside Wuhan and 15.0 [4.0-26.0] outside Hubei; P\u2009<\u2009.001). Multivariable logistic regression analysis showed participants from outside Hubei province were associated with lower risk of experiencing symptoms of distress compared with those in Wuhan (odds ratio [OR], 0.62; 95% CI, 0.43-0.88; P\u2009=\u2009.008). Frontline health care workers engaged in direct diagnosis, treatment, and care of patients with COVID-19 were associated with a higher risk of symptoms of depression (OR, 1.52; 95% CI, 1.11-2.09; P\u2009=\u2009.01), anxiety (OR, 1.57; 95% CI, 1.22-2.02; P\u2009<\u2009.001), insomnia (OR, 2.97; 95% CI, 1.92-4.60; P\u2009<\u2009.001), and distress (OR, 1.60; 95% CI, 1.25-2.04; P\u2009<\u2009.001).\nConclusions and Relevance  In this survey of heath care workers in hospitals equipped with fever clinics or wards for patients with COVID-19 in Wuhan and other regions in China, participants reported experiencing psychological burden, especially nurses, women, those in Wuhan, and frontline health care workers directly engaged in the diagnosis, treatment, and care for patients with COVID-19.\nIntroduction\nSince the end of December 2019, the Chinese city of Wuhan has reported a novel pneumonia caused by coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which is spreading domestically and internationally.1 The virus has been named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). In this report, we will refer to the disease, COVID-19. According to data released by the National Health Commission of China, the number of confirmed cases in mainland China has increased to 80\u202f151 as of March 2, 2020,2 and confirmed cases have been reported in more than a dozen other countries. Moreover, person-to-person transmission has been recorded outside mainland China.3 On January 30, 2020, the World Health Organization held an emergency meeting and declared the global COVID-19 outbreak a public health emergency of international concern.4\nFacing this critical situation, health care workers on the front line who are directly involved in the diagnosis, treatment, and care of patients with COVID-19 are at risk of developing psychological distress and other mental health symptoms. The ever-increasing number of confirmed and suspected cases, overwhelming workload, depletion of personal protection equipment, widespread media coverage, lack of specific drugs, and feelings of being inadequately supported may all contribute to the mental burden of these health care workers. Previous studies have reported adverse psychological reactions to the 2003 SARS outbreak among health care workers.5-8 Studies showed that those health care workers feared contagion and infection of their family, friends, and colleagues,5 felt uncertainty and stigmatization,5,6 reported reluctance to work or contemplating resignation,6 and reported experiencing high levels of stress, anxiety, and depression symptoms,7 which could have long-term psychological implications.7 Similar concerns about the mental health, psychological adjustment, and recovery of health care workers treating and caring for patients with COVID-19 are now arising.\nPsychological assistance services, including telephone-, internet-, and application-based counseling or intervention, have been widely deployed by local and national mental health institutions in response to the COVID-19 outbreak. On February 2, 2020, the State Council of China announced that it was setting up nationwide psychological assistance hotlines to help during the epidemic situation.9 However, evidence-based evaluations and mental health interventions targeting front-line health care workers are relatively scarce.\nTo address this gap, the aim of current study was to evaluate mental health outcomes among health care workers treating patients with COVID-19 by quantifying the magnitude of symptoms of depression, anxiety, insomnia, and distress and by analyzing potential risk factors associated with these symptoms. Participants from Wuhan city (the capital of Hubei province) and other areas inside and outside Hubei province in China were enrolled in this survey to compare interregional differences. This study aimed to provide an assessment of the mental health burden of Chinese health care workers, which can serve as important evidence to direct the promotion of mental well-being among health care workers.\nMethods\nStudy Design\nThis study followed the American Association for Public Opinion Research (AAPOR) reporting guideline. Approval from the clinical research ethics committee of Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University was received before the initiation of this study. Verbal informed consent was provided by all survey participants prior to their enrollment. Participants were allowed to terminate the survey at any time they desired. The survey was anonymous, and confidentiality of information was assured.\nThe study is a cross-sectional, hospital-based survey conducted via a region-stratified, 2-stage cluster sampling from January 29, 2020, to February 3, 2020. During this period, the total confirmed cases of COVID-19 exceeded 10\u202f000 in China. To compare the interregional differences of mental health outcomes among health care workers in China, samples were stratified by their geographic location (ie, Wuhan, other regions inside Hubei province, and regions outside Hubei province). Because Wuhan was most severely affected, more hospitals in Wuhan were sampled. Hospitals equipped with fever clinics or wards for COVID-19 were eligible to participate in this survey. A total of 20 hospitals in Wuhan (10 designated by the local government to treat COVID-19 and 10 nondesignated), 7 hospitals in other regions of Hubei province, and 7 hospitals from 7 other provinces with a high incidence of COVID-19 (1 hospital from each province) were included. In total, 34 hospitals were involved. Milestone events during the outbreak of COVID-19 and the duration of this study are presented in the eFigure in the Supplement.\nParticipants\nOne clinical department was randomly sampled from each selected hospital, and all health care workers in this department were asked to participate in this study. The target sample size of participants was determined using the formula N\u2009=\u2009Z\u03b12P(1\u2009\u2212\u2009P)\u2009/\u2009d2, in which \u03b1\u2009=\u20090.05 and Z\u03b1\u2009=\u20091.96, and the estimated acceptable margin of error for proportion d was 0.1. The proportion of health care workers with psychological comorbidities was estimated at 35%, based on a previous study of the SARS outbreak.7 To allow for subgroup analyses, we amplified the sample size by 50% with a goal of at least 1070 completed questionnaires from participants.\nOutcomes and Covariates\nWe focused on symptoms of depression, anxiety, insomnia, and distress for all participants, using Chinese versions of validated measurement tools.10-13 Accordingly, the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9; range, 0-27),10 the 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) scale (range, 0-21),11 the 7-item Insomnia Severity Index (ISI; range, 0-28),12 and the 22-item Impact of Event Scale\u2013Revised (IES-R; range, 0-88)13 were used to assess the severity of symptoms of depression, anxiety, insomnia, and distress, respectively. The total scores of these measurement tools were interpreted as follows: PHQ-9, normal (0-4), mild (5-9), moderate (10-14), and severe (15-21) depression; GAD-7, normal (0-4), mild (5-9), moderate (10-14), and severe (15-21) anxiety; ISI, normal (0-7), subthreshold (8-14), moderate (15-21), and severe (22-28) insomnia; and IES-R, normal (0-8), mild (9-25), moderate (26-43), and severe (44-88) distress. These categories were based on values established in the literature.10-13\nThe cutoff score for detecting symptoms of major depression, anxiety, insomnia, and distress were 10, 7,14 15, and 26, respectively. Participants who had scores greater than the cutoff threshold were characterized as having severe symptoms.\nDemographic data were self-reported by the participants, including occupation (physician or nurse), sex (male or female), age (18-25, 26-30, 31-40, or >40 years), marital status, educational level (\u2264undergraduate or \u2265postgraduate), technical title (junior, intermediate, or senior), geographic location (Wuhan, Hubei province outside Wuhan, or outside Hubei province), place of residence (urban or rural), and type of hospital (secondary or tertiary). The different technical titles of respondents refer to the professional titles certificated by the hospital. Participants were asked whether they were directly engaged in clinical activities of diagnosing, treating, or providing nursing care to patients with elevated temperature or patients with confirmed COVID-19. Those who responded yes were defined as frontline workers, and those who answered no were defined as second-line workers.\nStatistical Analysis\nData analysis was performed using SPSS statistical software version 20.0 (IBM Corp). The significance level was set at \u03b1\u2009=\u2009.05, and all tests were 2-tailed. The original scores of the 4 measurement tools were not normally distributed and so are presented as medians with interquartile ranges (IQRs). The ranked data, which were derived from the counts of each level for symptoms of depression, anxiety, insomnia, and distress, are presented as numbers and percentages. The nonparametric Mann-Whitney U test and Kruskal-Wallis test were applied to compare the severity of each symptom between 2 or more groups. To determine potential risk factors for symptoms of depression, anxiety, insomnia, and distress in participants, multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed, and the associations between risk factors and outcomes are presented as odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CIs, after adjustment for confounders, including sex, age, marital status, educational level, technical title, place of residence, working position (first-line or second-line), and type of hospital.\nResults\nDemographic Characteristics\nIn the study, among the 1830 health care workers (702 [38.4%] physicians and 1128 [61.6%] nurses) asked to participate, 1257 respondents (68.7%) completed the survey. The occupational and geographic data of nonrespondents were similar to those of respondents (eTable 1 in the Supplement). Of the 1257 responding participants, 493 (39.2%) were physicians, and 764 (60.8%) were nurses. The response rates for physicians and nurses were 70.2% and 67.7%, respectively. Of the participants, 760 (60.5%) worked in Wuhan, 261 (20.8%) worked in Hubei province outside Wuhan, and 236 (18.8%) worked outside Hubei province. Most participants were women (964 [76.7%]), were aged 26 to 40 years (813 [64.7%]), were married, widowed, or divorced (839 [66.7%]), had an educational level of undergraduate or less (953 [75.8%]), had a junior technical title (699 [55.6%]), and worked in tertiary hospitals (933 [74.2%]). A total of 522 participants (41.5%) were frontline health care workers directly engaged in diagnosing, treating, or caring for patients with or suspected to have COVID-19. Nearly all participants (1220 [97.1%]) lived in urban areas (Table 1).\nSeverity of Measurements and Associated Factors\nA considerable proportion of participants had symptoms of depression (634 [50.4%]), anxiety (560 [44.6%]), insomnia (427 [34.0%]), and distress (899 [71.5%]). Nurses, women, frontline workers, and those in Wuhan reported experiencing more severe symptom levels of depression, anxiety, insomnia, and distress (eg, severe depression among physicians vs nurses: 24 [4.9%] vs 54 [7.1%]; P\u2009=\u2009.01; severe anxiety among men vs women: 10 [3.4%] vs 56 [5.8%]; P\u2009=\u2009.001; severe insomnia among frontline workers vs second-line workers: 9 [1.7%] vs 3 [0.4%]; P\u2009<\u2009.001; severe distress among workers in Wuhan vs Hubei outside Wuhan and outside Hubei: 96 [12.6%] vs 19 [7.2%] among those in Hubei outside Wuhan and 17 [7.2%] among those outside Hubei; P\u2009<\u2009.001) (Table 2). Compared with those working in tertiary hospitals, participants working in secondary hospitals were more likely to report severe symptoms of depression (53 [5.6%] vs 25 [7.7%]; P\u2009=\u2009.003), anxiety (48 [5.1%] vs 18 [5.5%]; P\u2009=\u2009.046), and insomnia (10 [1.0%] vs 2 [0.6%]; P\u2009=\u2009.02) but not distress (Table 2).\nScores of Measurements and Associated Factors\nThe median (IQR) scores on the PHQ-9 for depression, the GAD-7 for anxiety, the ISI for insomnia, and the IES-R for distress for all respondents were 5.0 (2.0-8.0), 4.0 (1.0-7.0), 5.0 (2.0-9.0), and 20.0 (7.0-31.0), respectively. Similar to findings in severity of symptoms, participants who were nurses, women, frontline health care workers, and working in Wuhan had higher scores in all 4 scales compared with those who were physicians, men, second-line health care workers, and working in Hubei province outside Wuhan or outside Hubei province (eg, median [IQR] PHQ-9 scores among physicians vs nurses: 4.0 [1.0-7.0] vs 5.0 [2.0-8.0]; P\u2009=\u2009.007; median [IQR] GAD-7 scores among men vs women: 2.0 [0-6.0] vs 4.0 [1.0-7.0]; P\u2009<\u2009.001; median [IQR] ISI scores among frontline vs second-line workers: 6.0 [2.0-11.0] vs 4.0 [1.0-8.0]; P\u2009<\u2009.001; median [IQR] IES-R scores among those in Wuhan vs those in Hubei outside Wuhan and those outside Hubei: 21.0 [8.5-34.5] vs 18.0 [6.0-28.0] in Hubei outside Wuhan and 15.0 [4.0-26.0] outside Hubei; P\u2009<\u2009.001) (Table 3). Compared with health care workers in tertiary hospitals, those in secondary hospitals reported higher scores on scales measuring symptoms of depression, anxiety, and insomnia (median [IQR] PHQ-9 score, 4.0 [1.0-7.0] vs 5.0 [2.0-9.0]; P\u2009<\u2009.001; median [IQR] GAD-7 score, 3.0 [0-7.0] vs 4.0 [1.0-7.0]; P\u2009=\u2009.005; median [IQR] ISI score, 4.0 [2.0-9.0] vs 6.0 [2.0-10.0]; P\u2009=\u2009.008). There were no differences in hospital status for scores of distress (median [IQR] IES-R score: workers in tertiary hospitals, 19.0 [7.0-32.0]; workers in secondary hospitals, 20.0 [6.0-31.0]; P\u2009=\u2009.46). However, frontline health care workers from tertiary and secondary hospitals reported equally high scores on all 4 scales (eg, median [IQR] PHQ-9 score, 5.0 [2.0-8.0] vs 6.0 [3.0-9.0]; P\u2009=\u2009.08) (Table 4). In pairwise comparisons, participants from Hubei province outside Wuhan and participants outside Hubei province reported similar levels of symptoms of depression, anxiety, insomnia, and distress but were all lower than that of health care workers in Wuhan, the origin of the epidemic (eTable 2 in the Supplement). Analyses of scores of 3 factors (avoidance, intrusion, and hyperarousal) derived from the IES-R are presented in eTable 3, eTable 4, and eTable 5 in the Supplement.\nRisk Factors of Mental Health Outcomes\nMultivariable logistic regression analysis showed that, after controlling for confounders, being a woman and having an intermediate professional title were associated with severe symptoms of depression, anxiety, and distress (eg, severe depression among women: OR, 1.94; 95% CI, 1.26-2.98; P\u2009=\u2009.003; severe anxiety among those with intermediate professional titles: OR, 1.82; 95% CI, 1.38-2.39; P\u2009<\u2009.001). Compared with working in a tertiary hospital, working in secondary hospitals was associated with more severe symptoms of depression (OR, 1.65; 95% CI, 1.17-2.34; P\u2009=\u2009.004) and anxiety (OR, 1.43; 95% CI, 1.08-1.90; P\u2009=\u2009.01). Working outside Hubei province was associated with a lower risk of feeling distressed than working in Wuhan (OR, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.43-0.88; P\u2009=\u2009.008). Compared with working in second-line positions, working in the frontline directly treating patients with COVID-19 appeared to be an independent risk factor for all psychiatric symptoms after adjustment (depression, OR 1.52; 95% CI, 1.11-2.09; P\u2009=\u2009.01; anxiety, OR 1.57; 95% CI, 1.22-2.02; P\u2009<\u2009.001; insomnia, OR 2.97; 95% CI, 1.92-4.60; P\u2009<\u2009.001; distress: OR, 1.60; 95% CI, 1.25-2.04; P\u2009<\u2009.001) (Table 5).\nDiscussion\nThis cross-sectional survey enrolled 1257 respondents and revealed a high prevalence of mental health symptoms among health care workers treating patients with COVID-19 in China. Overall, 50.4%, 44.6%, 34.0%, and 71.5% of all participants reported symptoms of depression, anxiety, insomnia, and distress, respectively. Participants were divided in 3 groups (Wuhan, other regions in Hubei province, and regions outside Wuhan province) to compare interregional differences. Most participants were female, were nurses, were aged 26 to 40 years, were married, and worked in tertiary hospitals with a junior technical title. Nurses, women, those working in Wuhan, and frontline workers reported more severe symptoms on all measurements. Our study further indicated that being a woman and having an intermediate technical title were associated with experiencing severe depression, anxiety, and distress. Working in the front line was an independent risk factor for worse mental health outcomes in all dimensions of interest. Together, our findings present concerns about the psychological well-being of physicians and nurses involved in the acute COVID-19 outbreak.\nIn this study, a significant proportion of participants experienced anxiety, depression, and insomnia symptoms, and more than 70% reported psychological distress. In a previous study during the acute SARS outbreak, 89% of health care workers who were in high-risk situations reported psychological symptoms.8 The psychological response of health care workers to an epidemic of infectious diseases is complicated. Sources of distress may include feelings of vulnerability or loss of control and concerns about health of self, spread of virus, health of family and others, changes in work, and being isolated.15 The fact that COVID-19 is human-to-human transmissible,1,3 associated with high morbidity, and potentially fatal16 may intensify the perception of personal danger. Additionally, predictable shortages of supplies and an increasing influx of suspected and actual cases of COVID-19 contribute to the pressures and concerns of health care workers.17\nOf note, 76.7% of all participants were women, and 60.8% were nurses (90.8% of whom were female). Our findings further indicate that women reported more severe symptoms of depression, anxiety, and distress. Frontline nurses treating patients with COVID-19 are likely exposed to the highest risk of infection because of their close, frequent contact with patients and working longer hours than usual.18,19 Moreover, 71.5% of all nurses had junior titles, indicating that most had fewer years of work experience. During the SARS outbreak, a study conducted among health care workers in emergency departments also showed that nurses were more likely to develop distress and use behavioral disengagement than physicians.15 Frontline nurses treating patients with SARS were physically and psychologically challenged when committing themselves to providing high-quality nursing care for patients.19-22 Moreover, at the early stage of the SARS epidemic, nurses may have been less likely to be warned about exposure or provided with adequate protections.22 Particular attention is warranted regarding the mental health well-being of women and nurses treating patients with COVID-19.\nAnother finding in our study was that, compared with those in Hubei province outside Wuhan and those outside Hubei province, health care workers in Wuhan reported more severe symptoms of depression, anxiety, insomnia, and distress. Multivariable logistic regression analysis showed that working outside Hubei province was associated with lower risk of experiencing distress. These findings indicated more stress among health care workers in Wuhan, the origin and epicenter of the epidemic in China. In addition, working as a frontline health care worker with direct engagement of patients with COVID-19 was an independent risk factor for all symptoms. As frontline health care workers in Wuhan were at especially high risk for symptoms of depression, anxiety, insomnia, and distress, their mental health may require special attention.\nLimitations\nThis study has several limitations. First, it was limited in scope. Most participants (81.2%) were from Hubei province, limiting the generalization of our findings to less affected regions. Second, the study was carried out during 6 days and lacks longitudinal follow-up. Because of the increasingly arduous situation, the mental health symptoms of health care workers could become more severe. Thus, long-term psychological implications of this population are worth further investigation. Third, this study was unable to distinguish the association of symptoms with being a clinician in this region vs simply living in this region (because there was no comparator group) and was also unable to distinguish preexisting mental health symptoms vs new symptoms. Fourth, although the response rate of this study was 68.7%, response bias may still exist if the nonrespondents were either too stressed to respond or not at all stressed and therefore not interested in this survey.\nConclusions\nIn this survey study of physicians and nurses in hospitals with fever clinics or wards for patients with COVID-19 in China, health care workers responding to the spread of COVID-19 reported high rates of symptoms of depression, anxiety, insomnia, and distress. Protecting health care workers is an important component of public health measures for addressing the COVID-19 epidemic. Special interventions to promote mental well-being in health care workers exposed to COVID-19 need to be immediately implemented, with women, nurses, and frontline workers requiring particular attention.\nBack to top\nArticle Information\nAccepted for Publication: March 2, 2020.\nPublished: March 23, 2020. doi:10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2020.3976\nOpen Access: This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the CC-BY License. \u00a9 2020 Lai J et al.

The final date of follow-up was February 13, 2020.\nExposures  Confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia.\nMain Outcomes and Measures  The development of ARDS and death. Epidemiological, demographic, clinical, laboratory, management, treatment, and outcome data were also collected and analyzed.\nResults  Of 201 patients, the median age was 51 years (interquartile range, 43-60 years), and 128 (63.7%) patients were men. Eighty-four patients (41.8%) developed ARDS, and of those 84 patients, 44 (52.4%) died. In those who developed ARDS, compared with those who did not, more patients presented with dyspnea (50 of 84 [59.5%] patients and 30 of 117 [25.6%] patients, respectively [difference, 33.9%; 95% CI, 19.7%-48.1%]) and had comorbidities such as hypertension (23 of 84 [27.4%] patients and 16 of 117 [13.7%] patients, respectively [difference, 13.7%; 95% CI, 1.3%-26.1%]) and diabetes (16 of 84 [19.0%] patients and 6 of 117 [5.1%] patients, respectively [difference, 13.9%; 95% CI, 3.6%-24.2%]). In bivariate Cox regression analysis, risk factors associated with the development of ARDS and progression from ARDS to death included older age (hazard ratio [HR], 3.26; 95% CI 2.08-5.11; and HR, 6.17; 95% CI, 3.26-11.67, respectively), neutrophilia (HR, 1.14; 95% CI, 1.09-1.19; and HR, 1.08; 95% CI, 1.01-1.17, respectively), and organ and coagulation dysfunction (eg, higher lactate dehydrogenase [HR, 1.61; 95% CI, 1.44-1.79; and HR, 1.30; 95% CI, 1.11-1.52, respectively] and D-dimer [HR, 1.03; 95% CI, 1.01-1.04; and HR, 1.02; 95% CI, 1.01-1.04, respectively]). High fever (\u226539 \u00b0C) was associated with higher likelihood of ARDS development (HR, 1.77; 95% CI, 1.11-2.84) and lower likelihood of death (HR, 0.41; 95% CI, 0.21-0.82). Among patients with ARDS, treatment with methylprednisolone decreased the risk of death (HR, 0.38; 95% CI, 0.20-0.72).\nConclusions and Relevance  Older age was associated with greater risk of development of ARDS and death likely owing to less rigorous immune response. Although high fever was associated with the development of ARDS, it was also associated with better outcomes among patients with ARDS. Moreover, treatment with methylprednisolone may be beneficial for patients who develop ARDS.\nIntroduction\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was first reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China and has subsequently spread to other regions of China and 37 countries, including the United States, Japan, Australia, and France.1 SARS-CoV-2, which belongs to a unique clade of the sarbecovirus subgenus of the Orthocoronavirinae subfamily, was identified as the pathogen of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in January 2020.2\nAs reported by Huang et al,3 patients with COVID-19 present primarily with fever, myalgia or fatigue, and dry cough. Although most patients are thought to have a favorable prognosis, older patients and those with chronic underlying conditions may have worse outcomes. Patients with severe illness may develop dyspnea and hypoxemia within 1 week after onset of the disease, which may quickly progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) or end-organ failure.4 Certain epidemiological features and clinical characteristics of COVID-19 have been previously reported.3-5 However, these studies were based on relatively small sample sizes, and risk factors leading to poor clinical outcomes have not been well delineated. In this study, we report the clinical characteristics and factors associated with developing ARDS after hospital admission and progression from ARDS to death in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia from a single hospital in Wuhan, China.\nMethods\nStudy Population\nThis is a retrospective cohort study of 201 patients aged 21 to 83 years with confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia hospitalized at Jinyintan Hospital in Wuhan, China. All patients were diagnosed with COVID-19 pneumonia according to World Health Organization interim guidance.6 According to hospital data, patients were admitted from December 25, 2019, to January 26, 2020. Of 201 patients, 10 have been described previously by Chen et al4 and Huang et al.3 The ethics committee of Jinyintan Hospital approved this study and granted a waiver of informed consent from study participants.\nProcedures\nA trained team of physicians and medical students reviewed and collected epidemiological, clinical, and outcomes data from electronic medical records. Patients were followed up to February 13, 2020. The individual components of all definitions of clinical outcomes were recorded separately and checked by 2 authors (C.W. and X.C.). Patient confidentiality was protected by assigning a deidentified patient identification, and the electronic data was stored in a locked, password-protected computer.\nTo identify SARS-CoV-2 infection, throat swab samples were obtained from all patients at admission and tested using real-time reverse transcriptase\u2013polymerase chain reaction assays according to the same protocol described previously.3 The pathogenic detection was determined in 4 institutions (Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Academy of Military Medical Sciences, and Wuhan Institute of Virology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences) as described previously.4 Other respiratory pathogens, including respiratory syncytial virus, adenovirus, parainfluenza virus, influenza A virus, and influenza B virus, were also detected by real-time reverse transcriptase\u2013polymerase chain reaction assays in 173 patients. Possible bacterial or fungal pathogens were detected by sputum culture. Additionally, patients underwent blood routine blood test, coagulation, and biochemical tests and chest x-rays or computed tomography. The most intense level of oxygen support during hospitalization (nasal cannula, noninvasive mechanical ventilation [NMV], invasive mechanical ventilation [IMV], or IMV with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation [ECMO]) was recorded. The majority of the clinical data used in this study was collected from the first day of hospital admission unless indicated otherwise. To minimize interference of treatment during hospitalization, the highest patient temperature was defined using the self-reported highest temperature prior to hospital admission. Older age was classified as 65 years or older. Fever and high fever were classified as 37.3 \u00b0C or higher and 39 \u00b0C or higher, respectively.\nOutcomes\nTwo outcomes were evaluated: development of ARDS and death among those with ARDS. World Health Organization interim guidance was used to define ARDS.6\nStatistical Analysis\nDescriptive analyses of the variables were expressed as median (interquartile range [IQR]), or number (%). Differences in distributions of patient characteristics by outcome subgroups are reported using differences with 95% CIs. Categorical data were compared using the \u03c72 test or the Fisher exact test. Nonnormal distributed continuous data were compared using Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon test.\nBivariate Cox proportional hazard ratio (HR) models were used to determine HRs and 95% CIs between individual factors on the development of ARDS or progression from ARDS to death. Sample size varied because of missing data (summarized in Tables 1 and 2). Survival curves were developed using the Kaplan-Meier method with log-rank test. Time to events (ARDS or death) were defined as the time from hospital admission to events.\nThe analyses regarding different factors were based on nonmissing data, and missing data were not imputed. All tests were 2-sided, and a P value less than .05 was considered statistically significant. All analyses were performed with SPSS, version 23.0 (IBM SPSS), or R software, version 3.6.0 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing).\nResults\nDemographics and Characteristics\nA total of 201 patients were included in this study (Table 1). The median age was 51 years (IQR, 43-60 years), and 128 (63.7%) were male. The most commonly self-reported symptoms at onset of illness were fever (n\u2009=\u2009188 [93.5%]), cough (n\u2009=\u2009163 [81.1%]), productive cough (n\u2009=\u200983 [41.3%]), dyspnea (n\u2009=\u200980 [39.8%]), and fatigue or myalgia (n\u2009=\u200965 [32.3%]). The majority (n\u2009=\u2009154 [76.6%]) of patients had fever with cough; 74 (36.8%) had fever with dyspnea; 66 (32.8%) had fever with fatigue, myalgia, or headache; and only 13 (6.5%) presented with fever alone (eTable 1 in the Supplement). A total of 191 (95.0%) patients had findings of bilateral infiltrates on radiographic imaging, while 10 (5.0%) patients had unilateral infiltrates. Sixty-six (32.8%) patients had comorbidities, including hypertension (n\u2009=\u200939 [19.4%]), diabetes (n\u2009=\u200922 [10.9%]), liver disease (n\u2009=\u20097 [3.5%]), nervous system disease (n\u2009=\u20097 [3.5%]), chronic lung disease (n\u2009=\u20095 [2.5%]), chronic kidney disease (n\u2009=\u20092 [1.0%]), endocrine system diseases not including diabetes (n\u2009=\u20092 [1.0%]), and tumors (n\u2009=\u20091 [0.5%]). Most (n\u2009=\u2009173 [86.1%]) patients were tested for 9 additional respiratory pathogens. Bacteria and fungi cultures were collected from 148 (73.6%) patients. Only 1 patient was coinfected with influenza A virus.\nTreatments in Hospital\nOf the 201 patients, 165 (82.1%) required oxygen support in the hospital (Table 1). The most intense level was recorded, including nasal cannula (n\u2009=\u200998 [48.8%]), NMV (n\u2009=\u200961 [30.3%]), IMV (n\u2009=\u20095 [2.5%]), or IMV with ECMO (n\u2009=\u20091 [0.5%]). Among 201 patients, most (n\u2009=\u2009196 [97.5%]) received empirical antibiotic treatment and antiviral therapy (n\u2009=\u2009170 [84.6%]), including oseltamivir (n\u2009=\u2009134 [66.7%]), ganciclovir (n\u2009=\u200981 [40.3%]), lopinavir/ritonavir (n\u2009=\u200930 [14.9%]), and interferon alfa (n\u2009=\u200922 [10.9%]). More than half (n\u2009=\u2009106 [52.7%]) of patients received antioxidant therapy, including glutathione and N-acetyl-L-cysteine. Methylprednisolone was given to 62 (30.8%) patients, and immunomodulators, including immunoglobulin, thymosin, and recombinant human granulocyte colony stimulating factor, were given to 70 (34.8%) patients.\nLaboratory Indices\nLaboratory findings on hospital admission are summarized in Table 2. Of 194 patients, 166 (85.6%) demonstrated increased high-sensitivity C-reactive protein. More than half (126 of 197 [64.0%]) of this cohort had lymphocytopenia. About one-third (68 of 197 [34.5%]) of patients had neutrophilia. Approximately one-quarter (46 of 197 [23.4%]) of patients had leukocytosis. Some patients demonstrated liver injury with elevated aspartate aminotransferase (AST; 59 of 198 [29.8%]) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT; 43 of 198 [21.7%]). Most patients presented with an elevated myocardial indices: 194 of 198 (98.0%) had elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and 9 of 198 (4.5%) had an elevated creatine kinase muscle-brain isoform. Few patients had kidney injury indicated by elevated plasma urea (9 of 198 [4.5%]) and serum creatinine (9 of 198 [4.5%]). Of 195 patients, 4 (2.1%) presented with prolonged prothrombin times (PTs).\nClinical Outcomes\nAs of February 13, 2020, 144 of the total 201 patients (71.6%) were discharged from the hospital. The median hospital stay was 13 days (IQR, 10-16 days), and 13 (6.5%) patients were still hospitalized. Of the entire cohort, 84 (41.8%) patients developed ARDS, 53 (26.4%) were admitted to the intensive care unit, 67 (33.3%) received mechanical ventilation, and 44 (21.9%) died. Among the 67 patients who received mechanical ventilation, 44 (65.7%) died, 14 (20.9%) were discharged from the hospital, and 9 (13.4%) remained hospitalized. The median time from admission to developing ARDS was 2 days (IQR, 1-4 days). All of the patients who died had developed ARDS and received mechanical ventilation.\nTable 3 demonstrates that when compared with patients without ARDS, patients with ARDS were older (difference, 12.0 years; 95% CI, 8.0-16.0 years; P\u2009<\u2009.001) and had higher temperature prior to admission (difference, 0.30 \u00b0C; 95% CI, 0.00-0.50 \u00b0C; P\u2009=\u2009.004). More patients with ARDS presented with initial symptoms of dyspnea compared with those without ARDS (difference, 33.9%; 95% CI, 19.7%-48.1%; P\u2009<\u2009.001). Compared with patients without ARDS, patients with ARDS had a higher proportion of comorbidities, including hypertension (difference, 13.7%; 95% CI, 1.3%-26.1%; P\u2009=\u2009.02) and diabetes (difference, 13.9%; 95% CI, 3.6%-24.2%; P\u2009=\u2009.002). In addition, when compared with patients who did not have ARDS, patients who developed ARDS were less likely to be treated with antiviral therapy (difference, \u221214.4%; 95% CI, \u221226.0% to \u22122.9%; P\u2009=\u2009.005) and more likely to be treated with methylprednisolone (difference, 49.3%; 95% CI, 36.4%-62.1%; P\u2009<\u2009.001). Of 84 patients with ARDS, 61 (72.6%) received NMV, 17 (20.2%) received nasal cannula, 5 (6.0%) received IMV, and 1 (1.2%) received IMV with ECMO.\nCompared with patients without ARDS, for patients with ARDS, the value of liver damage indices (total bilirubin [difference, 1.90 mg/dL; 95% CI, 0.60-3.30 mg/dL; P\u2009=\u2009.004]), renal dysfunction indices (urea [difference, 1.69 mM; 95% CI, 1.10-2.29 mM; P\u2009<\u2009.001]), inflammation-related indices (interleukin-6 [IL-6] [difference, 0.93 pg/L; 95% CI, 0.07-1.98 pg/L; P\u2009=\u2009.03]), and coagulation function indices (D-dimer [difference, 0.52 \u03bcg/mL; 95% CI, 0.21-0.94 \u03bcg/mL; P\u2009<\u2009.001]) were significantly elevated. However, lymphocyte counts (difference, \u22120.34 \u00d7109/mL; 95% CI, \u22120.47 to \u22120.22 \u00d7109/mL; P\u2009<\u2009.001) and CD8 T cells (difference, \u221266.00 cells/\u03bcL; 95% CI, \u2212129.00 to \u22127.00 cells/\u03bcL; P\u2009=\u2009.03) were significantly decreased.\nAs summarized in Table 4, older age (\u226565 years old), high fever (\u226539 \u00b0C), comorbidities (eg, hypertension, diabetes), neutrophilia, lymphocytopenia (as well as lower CD3 and CD4 T-cell counts), elevated end-organ related indices (eg, AST, urea, LDH), elevated inflammation-related indices (high-sensitivity C-reactive protein and serum ferritin), and elevated coagulation function\u2013related indicators (PT and D-dimer) were significantly associated with higher risks of the development of ARDS. Patients who received treatment with methylprednisolone appear to have been sicker than patients who did not receive it. Specifically, a higher proportion of patients who received methylprednisolone were classified into a higher grade on the Pneumonia Severity Index7 compared with patients who did not receive methylprednisolone (P\u2009=\u2009.01; eTable 2 in the Supplement).\nIn the subgroup of patients who developed ARDS, patients who ultimately died were older (difference, 18.0 years; 95% CI, 13.0-23.0 years; P\u2009<\u2009.001) and had lower proportion of high fever (difference, \u221231.8%; 95% CI, \u221256.5% to \u22127.1%; P\u2009=\u2009.007) than those who survived. They also had higher proportions of hypertension (difference, 18.9%; 95% CI, \u22122.0% to 39.7%; P\u2009=\u2009.05). The patients who died were less likely to be treated with antiviral therapy (difference, \u221240.7%; 95% CI, \u221258.5% to \u221222.9%; P\u2009<\u2009.001). Regarding the most intense level of oxygen support among the 44 ARDS patients who died, 38 (86.4%) received NMV, 5 (11.4%) received IMV, and 1 (2.3%) received IMV with ECMO.\nFor patients with ARDS who died, the value of liver damage indices (total bilirubin [difference, 2.60 mg/dL; 95% CI, 0.30-5.20 mg/dL; P\u2009=\u2009.03]), renal dysfunction indices (urea [difference, 1.50 mM; 95% CI, 0.50-2.70 mM; P\u2009=\u2009.004]), inflammation-related indices (IL-6 [difference, 3.88 pg/L; 95% CI, 2.20-6.13 pg/L; P\u2009<\u2009.001]), and coagulation function indices (D-dimer [difference, 2.10 \u03bcg/mL; 95% CI, 0.89-5.27 \u03bcg/mL; P\u2009=\u2009.001]) were significantly elevated compared with patients with ARDS who survived. However, lymphocyte counts (difference, \u22120.23 \u00d7109/mL; 95% CI, \u22120.41 to \u22120.07 \u00d7109/mL; P\u2009=\u2009.004) and CD8 T cells (difference, \u2212134 cells/\u03bcL; 95% CI, \u2212221 to \u221210 cells/\u03bcL; P\u2009=\u2009.05) were significantly decreased (Table 3).\nBivariate Cox models showed that several factors related to the development of ARDS were not associated with death, which included comorbidities, lymphocyte counts, CD3 and CD4 T-cell counts, AST, prealbumin, creatinine, glucose, low-density lipoprotein, serum ferritin, and PT. However, IL-6 was statistically significantly associated with death (Table 4). Although high fever was associated with higher likelihood of developing ARDS (HR, 1.77; 95% CI, 1.11-2.84), it was negatively associated with death (HR, 0.41; 95% CI, 0.21-0.82).\nFinally, among the patients with ARDS, of those who received methylprednisolone treatment, 23 of 50 (46.0%) patients died, while of those who did not receive methylprednisolone treatment, 21 of 34 (61.8%) died. The administration of methylprednisolone appears to have reduced the risk of death in patients with ARDS (HR, 0.38; 95% CI, 0.20-0.72; P\u2009=\u2009.003) (Figure).\nDiscussion\nIn this cohort study, we reported the clinical characteristics and risk factors associated with clinical outcomes in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia who developed ARDS after admission, as well as those who progressed from ARDS to death. Patients who received methylprednisolone treatment were much more likely to develop ARDS likely owing to confounding by indication; specifically, sicker patients were more likely to be given methylprednisolone. However, administration of methylprednisolone appeared to reduce the risk of death in patients with ARDS. These findings suggest that for patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, methylprednisolone treatment may be beneficial for those who have developed ARDS on disease progression. However, these results should be interpreted with caution owing to potential bias and residual confounding in this observational study with a small sample size. Double-blinded randomized clinical trials should be conducted to validate these results.\nThe risk factors related to the development of ARDS and progression from ARDS to death included older age, neutrophilia, and organ and coagulation dysfunction (eg, higher LDH and D-dimer). In addition, we observed that several factors associated with the development of ARDS were not associated with death (eg, comorbidities, lymphocyte counts, CD3 and CD4 T-cell counts, AST, prealbumin, creatinine, glucose, low-density lipoprotein, serum ferritin, PT). Moreover, the difference in median D-dimer between the death and survival groups was larger than that between the ARDS and non-ARDS groups, which suggests that disseminated intravascular coagulation was on the pathway to death in some patients. Interestingly, although high fever was positively associated with development of ARDS, it was negatively related to death, which is consistent with results noted in a study by Schell-Chaple et al.8 However, the differences in patient temperature between the groups were very small and self-reported before hospital admission, thus the data regarding high fever should be cautiously interpreted.\nThe pathogenesis of highly pathogenic human coronavirus is still not completely understood. Cytokine storm and viral evasion of cellular immune responses are thought to play important roles in disease severity.9 Neutrophilia was found in both the peripheral blood10 and lung11 of patients with SARS-CoV. The severity of lung damage correlated with extensive pulmonary infiltration of neutrophils and macrophages and higher numbers of these cells in the peripheral blood in patients with Middle East respiratory syndrome.12-14 Neutrophils are the main source of chemokines and cytokines. The generation of cytokine storm can lead to ARDS, which is a leading cause of death in patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome 15 and Middle East respiratory syndrome.14 In this study, patients with COVID-19 pneumonia who had developed ARDS had significantly higher neutrophil counts than did those without ARDS, perhaps leading to the activation of neutrophils to execute an immune response against the virus, but also contributing to cytokine storm. This may partly explain the positive association of high fever and ARDS found at the early stages of COVID-19. In addition, considering that older age is associated with declined immune competence,16 the results of the present study showed that older age was associated with both ARDS and death. Therefore, older age related to death may be due to less robust immune responses.\nThe results of this study show that higher CD3 and CD4 T-cell counts might protect patients from developing ARDS, but similar results were not observed when examined for death, possibly because of limited sample size. CD8 counts were significantly higher in those who were alive. These results indicate the important roles of CD4 and CD8 T cells in COVID-19 pneumonia. Earlier studies have revealed that SARS-CoV, which was reported to share the same cell entry receptors with SARS-CoV-2,17,18 could infect immune cells, including T lymphocytes, monocytes, and macrophages.19 The CD3, CD4, and CD8 T-cell counts decreased at the onset of illness; this decrease persisted until the recovery period of SARS-CoV pneumonia.19 In addition, CD4 and CD8 T-cell counts decreased in the peripheral blood specimen of patients with fatal SARS-CoV pneumonia10,20,21, which was consistent with these results that patients with COVID-19 pneumonia and ARDS presented with lymphocytopenia (CD3, CD4, and CD8 T cells). Studies demonstrated that T-cell responses can inhibit the overactivation of innate immunity.22 T cells were reported to help clear SARS-CoV, and a suboptimal T-cell response was found to cause pathological changes observed in mice with SARS-CoV.23 We hypothesized that persistent and gradual increases in lymphocyte responses might be required for effective immunity against SARS-CoV-2 infection. Further studies are needed to characterize the role of the neutrophil and lymphocyte response or that of CD4 and CD8 T-cell immune response in SARS-CoV-2 infection.\nLimitations\nThis study has several limitations. First, owing to limited medical resources, only patients with relatively severe COVID-19 pneumonia were hospitalized during this period. Second, this study was conducted at a single-center hospital with limited sample size. As such, this study may have included disproportionately more patients with poor outcomes. There may also be a selection bias when identifying factors that influence the clinical outcomes. A larger cohort study of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia from Wuhan, China, other cities in China, and other countries would help to further define the clinical characteristics and risk factors of the disease.\nConclusions\nOlder age was associated with greater risk of developing ARDS and death, likely because of less rigorous immune response. Although fever was associated with the development of ARDS, it was also associated with better outcomes. Several factors related to the development of ARDS were not associated with death, which indicates that different pathophysiological changes from hospital admission to development of ARDS and from development of ARDS to death may exist. Moreover, treatment with methylprednisolone may be beneficial for patients who develop ARDS. Double-blinded randomized clinical trials to determine the most effective treatments for COVID-19 are still needed.\nBack to top\nArticle Information\nAccepted for Publication: March 3, 2020.\nCorresponding Authors: Yuanlin Song, MD, Department of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Zhongshan Hospital, Fudan University, 180 Fenglin Rd, Shanghai 200032, China (ylsong70_02@163.com); Junhua Zheng, MD, Department of Urology, Shanghai General Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, 85 Wujin Rd, Shanghai 200080, China (zhengjh0471@sina.com).\nPublished Online: March 13, 2020. doi:10.1001/jamainternmed.2020.0994\nAuthor Contributions: Drs Song and Zheng had full access to all of the data in the study and take responsibility for the integrity of the data and the accuracy of the data analysis.

The patient was treated with inotropic support, antiviral drugs, corticosteroids, and chloroquine, with progressive stabilization of the clinical course.\nMeaning  The emerging outbreak of COVID-19 can be associated with cardiac involvement, even after the resolution of the upper respiratory tract infection.\nAbstract\nImportance  Virus infection has been widely described as one of the most common causes of myocarditis. However, less is known about the cardiac involvement as a complication of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection.\nObjective  To describe the presentation of acute myocardial inflammation in a patient with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) who recovered from the influenzalike syndrome and developed fatigue and signs and symptoms of heart failure a week after upper respiratory tract symptoms.\nDesign, Setting, and Participant  This case report describes an otherwise healthy 53-year-old woman who tested positive for COVID-19 and was admitted to the cardiac care unit in March 2020 for acute myopericarditis with systolic dysfunction, confirmed on cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, the week after onset of fever and dry cough due to COVID-19. The patient did not show any respiratory involvement during the clinical course.\nExposure  Cardiac involvement with COVID-19.\nMain Outcomes and Measures  Detection of cardiac involvement with an increase in levels of N-terminal pro\u2013brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) and high-sensitivity troponin T, echocardiography changes, and diffuse biventricular myocardial edema and late gadolinium enhancement on cardiac magnetic resonance imaging.\nResults  An otherwise healthy 53-year-old white woman presented to the emergency department with severe fatigue. She described fever and dry cough the week before. She was afebrile but hypotensive; electrocardiography showed diffuse ST elevation, and elevated high-sensitivity troponin T and NT-proBNP levels were detected. Findings on chest radiography were normal. There was no evidence of obstructive coronary disease on coronary angiography. Based on the COVID-19 outbreak, a nasopharyngeal swab was performed, with a positive result for SARS-CoV-2 on real-time reverse transcriptase\u2013polymerase chain reaction assay. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging showed increased wall thickness with diffuse biventricular hypokinesis, especially in the apical segments, and severe left ventricular dysfunction (left ventricular ejection fraction of 35%). Short tau inversion recovery and T2-mapping sequences showed marked biventricular myocardial interstitial edema, and there was also diffuse late gadolinium enhancement involving the entire biventricular wall. There was a circumferential pericardial effusion that was most notable around the right cardiac chambers. These findings were all consistent with acute myopericarditis. She was treated with dobutamine, antiviral drugs (lopinavir/ritonavir), steroids, chloroquine, and medical treatment for heart failure, with progressive clinical and instrumental stabilization.\nConclusions and Relevance  This case highlights cardiac involvement as a complication associated with COVID-19, even without symptoms and signs of interstitial pneumonia.\nIntroduction\nThe first cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) were reported in December 2019, originating in Wuhan, China,1 with rapid spread worldwide, and COVID-19 became a public health emergency of international concern.2 The pathogen has been identified as a novel enveloped RNA beta-coronavirus and has been named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).3 The clinical course of SARS-CoV-2 infection is mostly characterized by respiratory tract symptoms, including fever, cough, pharyngodynia, fatigue, and complications related to pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome.4\nData regarding cardiovascular involvement due to SARS-CoV-2 infection are less described. Previous severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) beta-coronavirus infections could be associated with tachyarrhythmias and signs and symptoms of heart failure.5 The present report describes a case of cardiac involvement in a patient affected by COVID-19. The patient provided written informed consent, and the diagnostic procedures were conducted in accordance with institutional guidelines about the protection of human subjects.\nReport of a Case\nAn otherwise healthy 53-year-old white woman without previous history of cardiovascular disease presented to the emergency department with severe fatigue for 2 previous days. She denied chest pain, dyspnea, and further symptoms. She reported having fever and cough the week before.\nOn arrival to the emergency department, physical examination revealed blood pressure of 90/50 mm Hg, heart rate of 100 beats per minute, oxygen saturation of 98% while breathing ambient air, and body temperature of 36.6 \u00b0C. (She remained afebrile during the subsequent clinical course.) Arterial gas analysis showed a pH of 7.46, oxygen partial pressure of 82 mm Hg, carbon dioxide partial pressure of 32 mm Hg, and lactate level of 17.1 mg/dL (to convert to millimoles per liter, multiply by 0.111). A 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) showed low voltage in the limb leads, minimal diffuse ST-segment elevation (more prominent in the inferior and lateral leads), and an ST-segment depression with T-wave inversion in lead V1 and aVR (Figure 1A).\nFindings on chest radiography were unremarkable (Figure 1B). Blood tests revealed elevated levels of markers of myocyte necrosis (high-sensitivity troponin T level of 0.24 ng/mL [to convert to micrograms per liter, multiply by 1] and creatine kinase\u2013MB level of 20.3 ng/mL [to convert to micrograms per liter, multiply by 1]), elevated N-terminal pro\u2013brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) levels (5647 pg/mL [to convert to nanograms per liter, multiply by 1]), slight increase in C-reactive protein levels (1.3 mg/dL [to convert to milligrams per liter, multiply by 10), and normal blood cell counts (Table). Blood sample tests also revealed hyperkalemia, hyponatremia, and hypochloremia. These abnormalities were treated with kayexalate, glucose and insulin solution, and sodium bicarbonate. Given the echocardiography changes, regional wall motion abnormalities, and elevated markers of myocardial necrosis, urgent coronary angiography was performed, which showed no evidence of obstructive coronary disease.\nThe patient was admitted to the intensive care unit with a diagnosis of suspected myopericarditis. Based on the clinical history and the COVID-19 outbreak, COVID-19 was deemed as likely. A nasopharyngeal swab was performed with a positive result for SARS-CoV-2 on real-time reverse transcriptase\u2013polymerase chain reaction assay. Search for common cardiotropic infectious agents yielded negative results.\nTransthoracic echocardiography revealed normal left ventricular (LV) dimensions with an increased wall thickness (interventricular septum, 14 mm, posterior wall, 14 mm) and a diffuse echo-bright appearance of the myocardium. There was diffuse hypokinesis, with an estimated LV ejection fraction (LVEF) of 40%. There was no evidence of heart valve disease. Left ventricular diastolic function was mildly impaired with mitral inflow patterns, with an E/A ratio of 0.7 and an average E/e\u2032 ratio of 12. There was a circumferential pericardial effusion that was most notable around the right cardiac chambers (maximum, 11 mm) without signs of tamponade. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) confirmed the increased wall thickness with diffuse biventricular hypokinesis, especially in the apical segments, and severe LV dysfunction (LVEF of 35%) (Video 1 and Video 2). Short tau inversion recovery and T2-mapping sequences showed marked biventricular myocardial interstitial edema. Phase-sensitive inversion recovery sequences showed diffuse late gadolinium enhancement extended to the entire biventricular wall (Figure 2). The myocardial edema and pattern of late gadolinium enhancement fulfilled all the Lake Louise criteria for the diagnosis of acute myocarditis.6 The circumferential pericardial effusion was confirmed, especially around the right cardiac chambers (maximum, 12 mm).\nDuring the first days of her hospitalization, the patient remained hypotensive (systolic blood pressure less than 90 mm Hg) and required inotropic support (dobutamine) in the first 48 hours, during which there was a further increase in levels of NT-proBNP (8465 pg/mL), high-sensitivity troponin T (0.59 ng/mL), and creatine kinase\u2013MB (39.9 ng/mL), with a progressive stabilization and reduction during the following days (Table). Blood pressure progressively stabilized, although systolic pressure remained less than 100 mm Hg, and dobutamine treatment was weaned on day 4. Heart failure\u2013directed medical treatment was started with daily doses of 50 mg of kanrenone, 25 to 50 mg of furosemide, and 2.5 mg of bisoprolol, then reduced and finally withdrawn on day 5 owing to sinus bradycardia. The patient was treated on admission with intravenous aspirin (500 mg twice daily), and given the cardiac MRI findings, hydroxychloroquine (200 mg twice daily), lopinavir/ritonavir (2 tablets of 200/50 mg twice daily), and intravenous methylprednisolone (1 mg/kg daily for 3 days)7,8 were administrated. Chest radiography was repeated on day 4 and showed no thoracic abnormalities. Transthoracic echocardiography, performed on day 6, revealed a significant reduction of LV wall thickness (interventricular septum, 11 mm; posterior wall, 10 mm), an improvement of LVEF to 44%, and a slight decrease of pericardial effusion (maximum, 8-9 mm). At the time of submission, the patient was hospitalized with progressive clinical and hemodynamic improvement.\nDiscussion\nHerein, we describe a patient without a history of cardiovascular disease admitted to the hospital with COVID-19 and severe LV dysfunction and acute myopericarditis. Our main findings are that cardiac involvement may occur with COVID-19 even without respiratory tract signs and symptoms of infection.\nAfter the first cases describing pneumonia cases of unknown origin in Wuhan, China, SARS-CoV-2 rapidly spread worldwide with critical challenges for the public health and medical communities.1,2 The World Health Organization has declared SARS-CoV-2 a public health emergency of international concern, with a global estimate of 98\u202f192 laboratory-confirmed cases and 3380 deaths as of March 6, 2020.\nA 2020 report by the China Medical Treatment Expert Group for COVID-199 showed the spectrum of clinical and diagnostic features associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection among Chinese patients. The most common symptoms were fever (in up to 88.7% of patients during hospitalization) and cough (in 67.8% of patients), followed by dry cough, headache, fatigue, or shortness of breath. Complications were mostly related to physician-diagnosed pneumonia (91.1%) and acute respiratory distress syndrome.3,4 While the spectrum of clinical manifestation is highly related to the inflammation process of the respiratory tract, this case provides evidence of cardiac involvement as a possible late phenomenon of the viral respiratory infection. This process can be subclinical with few interstitial inflammatory cells, as reported by an autopsy study,10 or can present with overt manifestations even without respiratory symptoms, as in the present case.\nVirus infection has been widely described as one of the most common infectious causes of myocarditis, especially associated with influenza and parvovirus B-19 infection.11 However, less is known about the cardiac involvement as a complication of SARS-CoV-2 infection.\nMyocarditis results in focal or global myocardial inflammation, necrosis, and eventually ventricular dysfunction. Focal myocarditis is often suspected in patients presenting with chest pain after an influenzalike syndrome, with clinical evidence suggesting an acute coronary syndrome on electrocardiography or laboratory testing or with evidence of wall motion abnormalities without evidence of obstructive coronary artery disease on coronary angiography.12\nThe pathogenesis of cardiac involvement associated with SARS-CoV-2 may reflect a process of replication and dissemination of the virus through the blood or the lymphatic system from the respiratory tract. However, to our knowledge, there are no reports of influenza virus or coronavirus RNA in the heart, to date. Alternatively, SARS-CoV-2 could trigger an exaggerated inflammatory response that can cause myocardial injury, and this could justify the use of corticosteroids to attenuate inflammation, as in the present case. Evidence of a significant inflammatory cell infiltration has been reported in the alveoli of patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection,10 and this could explain the use of corticosteroids in patients with COVID-19 (up to 58% in a series of critically ill patients13). Although ultrastructural mechanisms are not certain, a potential binding to a viral receptor of the myocyte can favor the internalization and subsequent replication of the capsid proteins and the viral genome.14,15 In this patient, increases of cardiac troponin levels as a sensitive marker of myocardial injury, the cardiac MRI findings showing diffuse edema, and the slow gadolinium washout are in line with an acute myocarditis. In addition, the onset of symptoms several days after the influenzalike syndrome may reflect these proposed mechanisms with a potential myocyte dissemination of the virus, the activation of the immune system, and, ultimately, the clinical onset of heart failure.\nLimitations\nAs endomyocardial biopsy was not performed, limitations of this report are the lack of the histological demonstration of myocarditis and the absence of viral genome search in the heart. Except for the first 48 hours during which she required inotropic support, the patient was mainly treated with heart failure\u2013directed medical treatment. However, as described in the literature, viral myocarditis has a wide spectrum of clinical presentations, ranging from life-threating arrhythmias to advanced heart failure requiring invasive support.10\nConclusions\nWe believe that recognition by the scientific community of acute myocarditis as a possible complication associated with COVID-19 may be helpful for strict monitoring of affected patients and also for furthering knowledge of such complications for public health officials. This report highlights the importance of clinical surveillance and laboratory testing, including troponin levels, in individuals with recent symptoms of an acute illness to guarantee appropriate identification and prompt isolation of patients at risk of COVID-19 and eventually to reduce further transmission. Further evidence is needed to determine whether corticosteroids are useful in reducing the myocardial inflammatory response. We cannot exclude that a spontaneous resolution occurred or that antiviral drugs or chloroquine contributed to the improvement of this patient. Finally, awareness of atypical presentations such as this one is important to prompt patient isolation and prevent interhuman transmission.\nBack to top\nArticle Information\nAccepted for Publication: March 13, 2020.\nCorresponding Author: Marco Metra, MD, Institute of Cardiology, c/o Spedali Civili, Piazzale Spedali Civili 1, Brescia BS 25123, Italy (metramarco@libero.it).\nPublished Online: March 27, 2020. doi:10.1001/jamacardio.2020.1096\nAuthor Contributions: Drs Inciardi and Metra had full access to all of the data in the study and take responsibility for the integrity of the data and the accuracy of the data analysis.\nStudy concept and design: Inciardi, Lupi, Zaccone, Italia, Raffo, Tomasoni, Cani, Maroldi, Sinagra, Lombardi, Metra.\nAcquisition, analysis, or interpretation of data: Inciardi, Lupi, Zaccone, Raffo, Cerini, Farina, Gavazzi, Adamo, Ammirati, Metra.\nDrafting of the manuscript: Inciardi, Lupi, Zaccone, Italia, Raffo, Tomasoni, Cani, Farina, Metra.\nCritical revision of the manuscript for important intellectual content: Inciardi, Lupi, Cerini, Gavazzi, Maroldi, Adamo, Ammirati, Sinagra, Lombardi, Metra.\nAdministrative, technical, or material support: Lupi, Cerini, Metra.\nStudy supervision: Inciardi, Lupi, Farina, Maroldi, Adamo, Ammirati, Sinagra, Metra.\nConflict of Interest Disclosures: Dr Farina has received personal fees from Bayer and Bracco Group.

As a medical community, we are actively engaged in a real-time data gathering mode to facilitate active learning and an expedited study of best practices of care. Although we are becoming more aware of the natural history of COVID-19, we have had scant information as of yet that addresses any unique risks of COVID-19 for those with underlying cardiovascular disease. Such information is of paramount importance as we now must begin to consider the potential for direct and indirect adverse effects of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) on the heart and especially so in those with already established heart disease.\nThe statistics to date are staggering and relentlessly mounting. As of March 25, 2020, there have been more than 430\u202f000 individuals in more than 170 countries with confirmed COVID-19, of whom more than 19\u202f000 have died. In the US, there have been more than 49\u202f000 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in all 50 states and Washington, DC. It is clear that the number of infections in the US, the number needing critical care interventions, and especially the numbers of deaths will continue to escalate.\nThe available data from China and Italy as well as the early experience in the US indicate that COVID-19 is a relatively mild condition in most affected individuals, but in others, it can be very severe and deadly. What we now know is that individuals at greatest risk of serious illness sufficient to require intensive care and those at greatest risk of mortality are older individuals, particularly older individuals with underlying comorbid disease, including cardiovascular disease.1-5 However, severe disease requiring hospitalization and even deaths have been reported in younger adults.\nPatients with long-term coronary artery disease and those with risk factors for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease have a heightened risk of developing an acute coronary syndrome during acute infections, which has been shown previously in epidemiologic and clinical studies of influenza6-8 and other acute inflammatory conditions.9 Such acute coronary events could result from the severe increase in myocardial demand triggered by infections that precipitate myocardial injury or infarction, akin to type 2 myocardial infarction. Alternatively, circulating cytokines released during a severe systemic inflammatory stress could lead to atherosclerotic plaque instability and rupture. Similarly, patients with heart failure are also prone to hemodynamic decompensation during the stress of severe infectious illnesses. Thus, it is anticipated that patients with underlying cardiovascular diseases, which are more prevalent in older adults, would be susceptible to higher risks of adverse outcomes and death during the severe and aggressive inflammatory responses to COVID-19 than individuals who are younger and healthier. In addition, acute/fulminant myocarditis as well as heart failure have been reported with Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus and could be expected to occur with SARS-CoV-2, given the similar pathogenicity.\nTwo articles published in JAMA Cardiology from 2 academic hospitals in Wuhan, China, the epicenter of the COVID-19 pandemic,10,11 support these concepts while also providing novel insights into the incidence and consequences of myocardial injury associated with SARS-CoV-2. Shi et al10 present a cohort study of 416 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 confirmed by reverse transcriptase\u2013polymerase chain reaction, of whom 82 (19.7%) had evidence of myocardial injury manifested by elevation of high-sensitivity troponin I (TnI) levels. Patients with myocardial injury had a significantly higher in-hospital mortality rate (42 of 82 [51.2%]) compared with those without myocardial injury (15 of 335 [4.5%]), and among those with myocardial injury, greater degrees of TnI elevation were associated with higher mortality rates.\nSimilar observations were reported by Guo et al11 in 187 patients hospitalized with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19, of whom 52 (27.8%) had myocardial injury as determined by elevated levels of troponin T (TnT). In-hospital mortality was 59.6% (31 of 52) in those with elevated TnT levels compared with 8.9% (12 of 135) in those with normal TnT levels. Of note, the highest mortality rates were observed in those with elevated TnT levels who had underlying cardiovascular disease (25 of 36 [69.4%]), but mortality rates were also considerable in those with elevated TnT levels without prior cardiovascular disease (6 of 16 [37.5%]). In contrast, patients with known cardiovascular disease without elevation of TnT levels had a relatively favorable but still worrisome prognosis (mortality of 13.3% [4 of 30]). Guo et al11 provide additional novel insights that TnT levels are significantly associated with levels of C-reactive protein and N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), thus linking myocardial injury to severity of inflammation and ventricular dysfunction. Their data also show progressive serial increases in both TnT and NT-proBNP levels during hospitalization in patients who follow a deteriorating clinical course toward death, whereas those with a more favorable outcome with less severe illness, successful treatment, and hospital discharge show stable low levels of these biomarkers.\nShi et al10 and Guo et al11 report remarkably similar characteristics of patients who develop myocardial injury (as assessed by elevated levels of TnI or TnT) associated with COVID-19. Patients at risk of myocardial injury are older and have a higher prevalence of hypertension, coronary artery disease, heart failure, and diabetes than those with normal levels of TnI or TnT. Patients with myocardial injury also have evidence of more severe systemic inflammation, including greater leukocyte counts and higher levels of C-reactive protein and procalcitonin as well as high levels of other biomarkers of myocardial injury and stress, such as elevated creatine kinase, myoglobin, and NT-proBNP. Further, patients who develop myocardial injury with COVID-19 have clinical evidence of higher acuity, with a higher incidence of acute respiratory distress syndrome and more frequent need for assisted ventilation than those without myocardial injury. Thus, a consistent picture emerges from these 2 reports that older patients with preexisting cardiovascular comorbidities and diabetes are prone to develop a higher acuity of illness after contracting SARS-CoV-2 associated with higher risk of myocardial injury and a markedly higher short-term mortality rate.10,11\nThese lines of evidence are followed by Yang and Zin12 in their Viewpoint that discusses the collision between the acute COVID-19 epidemic that has arisen in the past 3 months and the underlying cardiovascular epidemic that has been under way in China for decades. They acknowledge the many recent observations1-5 that patients with preexisting cardiovascular disease are susceptible to the most adverse complications of COVID-19, including death. Importantly, they also appropriately emphasize that there has thus far been insufficient attention to understanding the mechanisms responsible for these outcomes beyond the obvious recognition that severe infections can destabilize patients with coronary artery disease or heart failure. The current observations of Shi et al10 and Guo et al11 regarding the important association of myocardial injury with adverse outcomes begin to provide insights into other possible mechanisms, including demand ischemia that devolves into myocardial injury or plaque disruption stimulated by intense systemic inflammatory stimuli. As with other coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 can elicit the intense release of multiple cytokines and chemokines1,12 that can lead not only to vascular inflammation and plaque instability but also to myocardial inflammation. Direct viral infection of the myocardium is another possible causal pathway of myocardial damage and one that requires further investigation. It is noteworthy that the articles from China by Shi et al,10 Guo et al,11 and Yang and Zin12 address the unique marked affinity of SARS-CoV-2 for the host angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor, which has been shown previously for other coronaviruses,13 raising the possibility of direct viral infection of vascular endothelium and myocardium. It is thus possible that in some patients with or without preexisting cardiovascular disease, COVID-19\u2013associated myocardial injury could represent myocarditis.14 The well-documented case of acute myocarditis following a COVID-19\u2013associated respiratory infection in a 53-year-old Italian woman with no previous heart disease, also reported in this issue by Inciardi et al,15 supports this hypothesis.\nThe association of myocardial injury with outcomes of COVID-19 in the 2 Chinese cohorts10,11 represent early data from patients hospitalized at the outset of the epidemic in Wuhan, during which a rapidly escalating number of patients with previously unknown serious respiratory illnesses was beginning to stretch and overwhelm local health care systems. Given the severity of illness and the primary focus on urgently managing infection and respiratory failure, it is understandable that not all patients have complete cardiac data, such as electrocardiography, and that information from more sophisticated cardiac testing, such as echocardiography, coronary angiography, and magnetic resonance imaging, are not available. That we have the current data available to study is in itself a triumph and an acknowledgment of the intent of dedicated physicians to use bedside observations to inform others.\nWhether the data linking myocardial injury and high mortality risk in patients with COVID-19 from the 2 Chinese cohorts10,11 are generalizable to other countries, including the US, is yet to be determined. But the wake-up call has been delivered. We have a similar profile of elderly patients with cardiovascular disease in the US and other Western countries in which the toll of COVID-19 could be daunting. While remarkable efforts to unravel the mechanisms of myocardial injury are ongoing and candidate therapies are already entering clinical trials, as discussed in the comprehensive and scholarly review by Madjid et al,16 one message resonates with us: prevention. Until we know more, the populations described in these primary data reports should be most observant of strict hand hygiene, social distancing, and, where available, COVID-19 testing.\nBack to top\nArticle Information\nCorresponding Author: Robert O.

Myocardial injury has a significant association with fatal outcome of COVID-19, while the prognosis of patients with underlying CVD but without myocardial injury were relatively favorable.\nMeaning  It is reasonable to triage patients with COVID-19 according to the presence of underlying CVD and evidence of myocardial injury for prioritized treatment and even more aggressive strategies.\nAbstract\nImportance  Increasing numbers of confirmed cases and mortality rates of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are occurring in several countries and continents. Information regarding the impact of cardiovascular complication on fatal outcome is scarce.\nObjective  To evaluate the association of underlying cardiovascular disease (CVD) and myocardial injury with fatal outcomes in patients with COVID-19.\nDesign, Setting, and Participants  This retrospective single-center case series analyzed patients with COVID-19 at the Seventh Hospital of Wuhan City, China, from January 23, 2020, to February 23, 2020. Analysis began February 25, 2020.\nMain Outcomes and Measures  Demographic data, laboratory findings, comorbidities, and treatments were collected and analyzed in patients with and without elevation of troponin T (TnT) levels.\nResult  Among 187 patients with confirmed COVID-19, 144 patients (77%) were discharged and 43 patients (23%) died. The mean (SD) age was 58.50 (14.66) years. Overall, 66 (35.3%) had underlying CVD including hypertension, coronary heart disease, and cardiomyopathy, and 52 (27.8%) exhibited myocardial injury as indicated by elevated TnT levels. The mortality during hospitalization was 7.62% (8 of 105) for patients without underlying CVD and normal TnT levels, 13.33% (4 of 30) for those with underlying CVD and normal TnT levels, 37.50% (6 of 16) for those without underlying CVD but elevated TnT levels, and 69.44% (25 of 36) for those with underlying CVD and elevated TnTs. Patients with underlying CVD were more likely to exhibit elevation of TnT levels compared with the patients without CVD (36 [54.5%] vs 16 [13.2%]). Plasma TnT levels demonstrated a high and significantly positive linear correlation with plasma high-sensitivity C-reactive protein levels (\u03b2\u2009=\u20090.530, P\u2009<\u2009.001) and N-terminal pro\u2013brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) levels (\u03b2\u2009=\u20090.613, P\u2009<\u2009.001). Plasma TnT and NT-proBNP levels during hospitalization (median [interquartile range (IQR)], 0.307 [0.094-0.600]; 1902.00 [728.35-8100.00]) and impending death (median [IQR], 0.141 [0.058-0.860]; 5375 [1179.50-25695.25]) increased significantly compared with admission values (median [IQR], 0.0355 [0.015-0.102]; 796.90 [401.93-1742.25]) in patients who died (P\u2009=\u2009.001; P\u2009<\u2009.001), while no significant dynamic changes of TnT (median [IQR], 0.010 [0.007-0.019]; 0.013 [0.007-0.022]; 0.011 [0.007-0.016]) and NT-proBNP (median [IQR], 352.20 [174.70-636.70]; 433.80 [155.80-1272.60]; 145.40 [63.4-526.50]) was observed in survivors (P\u2009=\u2009.96; P\u2009=\u2009.16). During hospitalization, patients with elevated TnT levels had more frequent malignant arrhythmias, and the use of glucocorticoid therapy (37 [71.2%] vs 69 [51.1%]) and mechanical ventilation (41 [59.6%] vs 14 [10.4%]) were higher compared with patients with normal TnT levels. The mortality rates of patients with and without use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers was 36.8% (7 of 19) and 25.6% (43 of 168).\nConclusions and Relevance  Myocardial injury is significantly associated with fatal outcome of COVID-19, while the prognosis of patients with underlying CVD but without myocardial injury is relatively favorable. Myocardial injury is associated with cardiac dysfunction and arrhythmias. Inflammation may be a potential mechanism for myocardial injury. Aggressive treatment may be considered for patients at high risk of myocardial injury.\nIntroduction\nCoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a newly recognized infectious disease that has spread rapidly throughout Wuhan, Hubei, China, to other provinces in China and several countries around the world. The number of fatalities owing to COVID-19 is escalating. Previous studies have described the general clinical characteristics and epidemiological findings of patients with COVID-19, and some of the clinical observations have shown that the condition of some patients with COVID-19 deteriorates rapidly.1-4\nWith the increasing number of confirmed cases and the accumulating clinical data, in addition to the common clinical presentation of respiratory failure caused by COVID-19, the cardiovascular manifestations induced by this viral infection has generated considerable concern. Huang et al5 reported that 12% of patients with COVID-19 were diagnosed as having acute myocardial injury, manifested mainly by elevated levels of high-sensitive troponin I. From other recent data, among 138 hospitalized patients with COVID-19, 16.7% had arrhythmias and 7.2% had acute myocardial injury.6 However, at present, specific information characterizing whether patients with COVID-19 with underlying cardiovascular disease (CVD) who develop myocardial injury during hospitalization face greater risk and have worse in-hospital outcomes remains unknown. The present study investigated the association of underlying CVD and myocardial injury with fatal outcomes of patients with COVID-19.\nMethods\nStudy Design and Participants\nThis single-center, retrospective, observational study was performed at the Seventh Hospital of Wuhan City, China, which is a designated hospital to treat patients with COVID-19 and supervised by the Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University in Wuhan, China. We retrospectively analyzed patients with COVID-19 who were diagnosed according to the interim guidance of the World Health Organization7 from January 23, 2020, to February 23, 2020, and who were either treated and discharged or died during hospitalization. Clinical information was collected on admission and during hospitalization by attending physicians.\nThis study complied with the edicts of the 1975 Declaration of Helsinki8 and was approved by the institutional ethics board of Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University and the Seventh Hospital of Wuhan City (no. 2020026). Consent was obtained from patients or patients\u2019 next of kin.\nData Collection\nThe electronic medical records of the patients were reviewed by a trained team of physicians who worked in Seventh Hospital of Wuhan City during the epidemic period. Patient data including demographics, medical history, laboratory examinations, comorbidities, complication, treatment measures (antiviral, antibiotic, corticosteroid therapies, immune glucocorticoid therapy, and respiratory support), and outcomes were collected and analyzed.\nOutcome\nThe end point was incidence of COVID-19\u2013associated death. Successful treatment toward hospital discharge comprised relieved clinical symptoms, normal body temperature, significant resolution of inflammation as shown by chest radiography, and at least 2 consecutive negative results shown by real-time reverse transcription\u2013polymerase chain reaction assay6 for COVID-19.\nAcute respiratory distress syndrome was defined according to the Berlin Definition.9 Malignant arrhythmia was defined as rapid ventricular tachycardia lasting more than 30 seconds, inducing hemodynamic instability and/or ventricular fibrillation. Patients were considered to have acute myocardial injury if serum levels of troponin T (TnT) were above the 99th percentile upper reference limit.5\nStatistical Analysis\nCategorical variables are shown as frequency rates and percentages, and continuous variables as mean\u2009(SD) and median (interquartile range [IQR]). The means for continuous variables were compared using independent group t tests when the data were normally distributed, otherwise, the Mann-Whitney test was used. The Pearson correlation coefficient and Spearman rank correlation coefficient were used for liner correlation analysis. Proportions for categorical variables were compared using the \u03c72 test, although the Fisher exact test was used when data were limited. Wilcoxon rank sum matched-pair tests were used to assess differences among the admission, hospitalization, and impending death. All statistical analyses were performed with SPSS, version 19.0 (IBM Corp) for Windows. A 2-sided P\u2009<\u2009.05 was considered statistically significant. Analysis began February 25, 2020.\nResults\nClinical Characteristics on Admission\nData were collected in consecutive patients hospitalized with COVID-19, including 211 patients who were successfully treated and discharged and 45 patients who died. We excluded 67 discharged patients and 2 patients who died because of incomplete data, leaving 144 discharged individuals and 43 individuals who died included for final analysis. Of 187 patients, 66 (35.3%) had underlying CVD including hypertension, coronary heart disease, and cardiomyopathy, and 52 (27.8%) exhibited myocardial injury as indicated by elevated TnT levels.\nOn admission, none showed evidence of acute myocardial infarction, chronic liver disease, thromboembolic diseases, or rheumatism. In patients with elevated plasma TnT levels who eventually were discharged or died, the median (IQR) duration from illness onset to discharge or death was 28 (22-33) and 23.5 (18.25-34.5) days, respectively. Mortality was markedly higher in patients with elevated plasma TnT levels than in patients with normal TnT levels (31 [59.6%] vs 12 [8.9%]) (Table 1).\nCompared with patients with normal TnT levels (Table 1), those with elevated TnT levels were older (mean [SD] age, 71.40 [9.43] vs 53.53 [13.22]) and had a higher proportion of men (34 [65.4%] vs 57 [42.2%]). Patients with elevated TnT levels had significantly higher rates of comorbidities including hypertension (33 [63.5%] vs 28 [20.7%]), coronary heart disease (17 [32.7%] vs 4 [3.0%]), cardiomyopathy (8 [15.4%] vs 0), diabetes (16 [30.8%] vs 12 [8.9%]), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (4 [7.7%] vs 0), and chronic kidney disease (1 [0.7%] vs 5 [9.6%]). Rates of smoking and malignant neoplasms did not differ between those with normal (11 [8.1%] vs 7 [13.5%]) and elevated TnT levels (7 [5.2%] vs 6 [11.5%]).\nLaboratory Findings on Admission\nPatients with elevated TnT levels presented with significantly higher white blood cell count (median [IQR], 4640 [6170-3740] vs 7390 [4890-11\u202f630] /\u03bcL [to convert to \u00d7109 per liter, multiply by 0.001]) and neutrophil counts (median [IQR], 3070 [2350-4870] vs 6010 [3540-10\u202f120] /\u03bcL [to convert to \u00d7109 per liter, multiply by 0.001]) (P\u2009<\u2009.001 for both) and lower lymphocyte counts (median [IQR], 840 [630-1130] vs 690 [340-1010] /\u03bcL [to convert to \u00d7109 per liter, multiply by 0.001; P\u2009=\u2009.01) than those with normal TnT levels (Table 2). Patients with elevated TnT levels also had significantly longer prothrombin time (median [IQR], 12.4 [12.0-13.0] vs 13.3 [12.2-15.3] seconds; P\u2009=\u2009.005), shorter activated partial thromboplastin time (median [IQR], 31.2 [27.5-33.2] vs 32.7 [31.0-35.8] seconds; P\u2009=\u2009.003), and a significant higher level of D-dimer (median [IQR], 0.29 [0.17-0.60] vs 3.85 [0.51-25.58] \u03bcg/mL [to convert to nanomoles per liter, multiply by 5.476]; P\u2009<\u2009.001). Hemoglobin and neutrophil counts of the 2 groups were similar.\nTotal, high-density lipoprotein, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels did not differ according to TnT levels, but patients with elevated TnT levels had higher triglyceride levels (median [IQR], 92.04 [69.91-159.29] vs 82.30 [59.29-115.04] mg/dL [to convert to millimoles per liter, multiply by 0.0259]; P\u2009=\u2009.04). The inflammatory biomarkers, including high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (median [IQR], 8.55 [4.87-15.165] vs 3.13 [1.24-5.75] mg/dL [to convert to milligrams per liter, multiply by 10]), procalcitonin (median [IQR], 0.21 [0.11-0.45] vs 0.05 [0.04-0.11] ng/mL), and globulin (median [IQR], 29.7 [27.0-34.6] vs 27.4 [25.6-29.6] grams per liter) were significantly higher in patients with elevated TnT levels (P\u2009<\u2009.001 for all).\nNotably, patients with normal and elevated TnT levels differed with respect to multiple indexes of organ function including the heart, liver, kidney, and lungs (Table 2). Those with elevated TnT levels had significantly higher levels of other biomarkers of cardiac injury, specifically creatine kinase\u2013myocardial band test (median [IQR], 3.34 [2.11-5.80] vs 0.81 [0.54-1.38], ng/mL [to convert to micrograms per liter, multiply by 1]) and myoglobin (median [IQR], 128.7 [65.8-206.9] vs 27.2 [21.0-49.8] \u00b5g/L [to convert to nanomoles per liter, multiply by 0.05814]) (P\u2009<\u2009.001, for all) and also had higher levels of N-terminal pro\u2013brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) (median [IQR], 817.4 (336.0-1944.0] vs 141.4 [39.3-303.6] pg/mL [to convert to nanograms per liter, multiply by 1]). Patients with elevated TnT levels had evidence of more severe respiratory dysfunction, with lower partial pressure of oxygen (Pao2) (median [IQR], 64.0 [51.0-93.0] vs 91.0 [75.0-121.0] mm Hg), HCO3 (median [IQR], 23.3 [20.0-27.1] vs 25.7 [23.8-27.9] mEq/L [to convert to to millimoles per liter, multiply by 1]), and Pao2/fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) (median [IQR], 153.3 [103.3-323.8] vs 390.5 [285.7-461.9] mm Hg), and higher levels of lactic acid (median [IQR], 2.10 [1.40-3.10] vs 1.80 [1.30-2.10] mm Hg) (P\u2009<\u2009.001, P\u2009<\u2009.001, P\u2009=\u2009.004, P\u2009=\u2009.001, respectively). Those with elevated TnT levels also had higher levels of creatinine (median [IQR], 0.79 [0.71-1.17] vs 0.63 [0.55-0.79] mg/dL [to convert to micromoles per liter, multiply by 88.4]) and aspartate aminotransferase (median [IQR], 39.5 [27.2-57.8] vs 29.0 [21.0-39.0] U/L [to convert to microkatal per liter, multiply by 0.0167]) (P\u2009<\u2009.001, both), but alanine aminotransferase did not differ between the 2 groups.\nPlasma TnT levels in patients with COVID-19 correlated significantly with both plasma high-sensitivity C-reactive protein levels (\u03b2\u2009=\u20090.530, P\u2009<\u2009.001) (Figure 1A) and plasma NT-proBNP levels (\u03b2\u2009=\u20090.613, P\u2009<\u2009.001) (Figure 1B).\nComparison of Complications and Treatment During Hospitalization\nPatients with underlying CVD were more likely to exhibit elevation of TnT levels (36 [54.5%]) compared with patients without CVD (16 [13.2%]). During hospitalization, patients with elevated TnT levels developed more frequent complications (Table 1), including acute respiratory distress syndrome (30 [57.7%] vs 16 [11.9%]), malignant arrhythmias (6 [11.5%] vs 7 [5.2%]) including ventricular tachycardia/ventricular fibrillation, acute coagulopathy (25 [65.8%] vs 17 [20.0%]), and acute kidney injury (14 [36.8%] vs 4 [4.7%]), compared with those with normal TnT levels. However, there was no significant differences in incidence of acute liver injury between the 2 groups. Antiviral (oseltamivir, 75 mg twice a day; ribavirin, 0.5 g twice a day; umifenovir, 0.2 g 3 times a day), antibacterial (moxifloxacin, 0.4 g every day), glucocorticoid (methylprednisolone, 40-80 mg every day), and respiratory support were the main treatment approaches for the hospitalized patients (Table 1). During hospitalization, the majority of patients underwent antiviral and antibacterial therapy, with no significant difference in such therapies between patients with normal and elevated TnT levels. However, the rates of glucocorticoid therapy and mechanical ventilation were much higher in patients with elevated TnT levels compared with those with normal TnT levels.\nLong-term outpatient medications prior to admission, such as antihypertensive drugs and hypoglycemic drugs, were not discontinued. Notably, the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs)/angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) was higher in patients with elevated TnT levels (11 [21.1%] vs 8 [5.9%]; Table 1), reflecting the higher rates of CVD. The mortality rates of patients with and without use of ACEIs/ARBs was 36.8% (7 of 19) and 25.6% (43 of 168).\nMortality of Patients With COVID-19 With/Without CVD and With/Without Elevated TnT Levels\nAmong 187 patients, 7.62% (8 of 105) with normal TnT levels without underlying CVD, 13.33% (4 of 30) with normal TnT levels with underlying CVD, 37.50% (6 of 16) with elevated TnT levels without underlying CVD, and 69.44% (25 of 36) with elevated TnT levels with underlying CVD died during hospitalization (Figure 2).\nDynamic Changes of TnT and NT-proBNP Levels During Hospitalization\nFigure 3 shows the dynamic escalation of TnT and NT-proBNP levels for patients who died and those who were successfully treated and discharged. Both TnT and NT-proBNP levels increased significantly during the course of hospitalization in those who ultimately died, but no such dynamic changes of TnT or NT-proBNP levels were evident in survivors.\nDiscussion\nAssociation of Myocardial Injury With Prognosis\nThis report provides detailed cardiovascular information of the association between underlying CVD, myocardial injury, and fatal outcomes of patients with COVID-19. The Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention recently published the largest case series to date of COVID-19 in mainland China; the overall case fatality rate was 2.3% (1023 deaths among 44 672 confirmed cases), but the mortality reached 10.5% in patients with underlying CVD.10\nIn the current study, among 187 patients with COVID-19, 52 (27.8%) exhibited myocardial injury as demonstrated by elevation of TnT levels, and the mortality was markedly higher in patients with elevated TnT levels than in patients with normal TnT levels (59.6% vs 8.9%). The median (IQR) duration from illness onset to death was 23.23 (8-41) days in the group with elevated TnT levels. Patients with underlying CVD and escalation of TnT levels had the highest mortality (69.44%) and the shortest survival term. However, patients with underlying CVD but with normal TnT levels during the course of disease experienced a more favorable prognosis, compared with patients with elevated TnT levels but without underlying CVD (mortality, 13.3% vs 37.5%). The dynamic escalation of NT-proBNP and increased incidence of malignant arrhythmias during the course of disease in patients with elevated TnT levels is evidence that myocardial injury played a greater role in the fatal outcome of COVID-19 than the presence of underlying CVD itself.\nNT-proBNP elevation and malignant arrhythmias were significantly more common in patients with elevated TnT levels, and NT-proBNP was significantly correlated with TnT levels (Figure 1). This suggests that those with myocardial injury were more likely to experience impairment in cardiac function.\nPotential Mechanism Underlying Myocardial Injury\nThe current study demonstrates that patients with underlying CVD and other comorbid conditions are more prone to experience myocardial injury during the course of COVID-19. For patients with underlying CVD, including hypertension, coronary heart disease, and cardiomyopathy, viral illness can further damage myocardial cells through several mechanisms including direct damage by the virus, systemic inflammatory responses, destabilized coronary plaque, and aggravated hypoxia. Therefore, patients with CVD are more likely to experience myocardial injury after COVID-19 infection and higher risk of death. However, it is also notable that the 16% of patients with underlying CVD but with normal TnT levels had a relatively favorable outcome in this study. These data suggest that myocardial biomarkers should be evaluated in patients with CVD who develop COVID-19 for risk stratification and possible early and more aggressive intervention.\nAlthough the exact pathophysiological mechanism underlying myocardial injury caused by COVID-19 is not fully understood, a previous report showed that in 35% of the patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) infection, the SARS-CoV genome was positively detected in the heart. This raises the possibility of direct damage of cardiomyocytes by the virus.11 SARS-CoV-2 may share the same mechanism with SARS-COV because the 2 viruses are highly homologous in genome.12,13 In the current study, plasma TnT levels were significantly positively linear correlated with plasma high-sensitivity C-reactive protein levels (Figure 2), indicating that myocardial injury may be closely associated with inflammatory pathogenesis during the progress of disease. Viral particles spread through respiratory mucosa and simultaneously infect other cells, which could precipitate a cytokine storm and a series of immune responses. Huang et al5 highlighted that in patients with COVID-19, the imbalance of T helper 1 and T helper 2 responses resulted in a cytokine storm, which may contribute to myocardial injury. The release of inflammatory cytokines after infection may cause reduction in coronary blood flow, decreases in oxygen supply, destabilization of coronary plaque, and microthrombogenesis.\nConsideration of Prevention and Treatment for Myocardial Injury\nUnfortunately, until now, no specific antiviral drugs or vaccines have been recommended for COVID-19 except for symptomatic supportive treatment and intervention. As patients with underlying CVD are more likely to develop more severe adverse outcomes when myocardial injury occurs after COVID-19 infection and face higher risk of death, it may be reasonable to triage patients with COVID-19 according to the presence of underlying CVD and evidence of myocardial injury for prioritized treatment and even more aggressive treatment strategies. Other cardiac biomarkers such as NT-proBNP and electrocardiograms should be closely monitored for early warning and intervention.\nThere remains controversy concerning the use of ACEI/ARB for COVID-19. In this study, with a limited number of patients, the mortality of those treated with or without use of ACEI/ARB did not show a significant difference in outcome. Concerns about ACEI/ARB have been raised since angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is a potential target for COVID-19 infection, and the increased ACE2 expression induced by ACEI or ARB would aggravate lung injury of patients with COVID-19. However, a previous study14 showed a beneficial effect of ACEI/ARB in patients admitted with viral pneumonia, as it significantly reduced the pulmonary inflammatory response and cytokine release caused by virus infection. The beneficial effect of ACEI/ARB may be related to a compensatory increase in ACE2.15 However, the evidence regarding the use of ACEI/ARB in patients with COVID-19 infection is still emerging, and larger clinical studies are required. At present, for patients with COVID-19 who previously used ACEI/ARB, the use of these drugs may not need to be discontinued based on current data.\nLimitations\nOur study has several limitations. First, only 187 patients with confirmed COVID-19 were included, and a larger cohort study is needed to verify our conclusions. Second, as a retrospective study, some other specific information regarding cardiovascular complications and inflammation such as echocardiography and interleukin 6 were not presented in the study because the data were incomplete owing to the limited conditions in the isolation ward and the urgency of containing the COVID-19 epidemic. Third, the data in this study permit a preliminary assessment of the clinical course and outcomes of patients with COVID-19. The causes of death may involve multiple organ dysfunction in most cases, and it is difficult to differentiate the myocardial injury as the main and direct cause in an individual case. Long-term observation and prospective study design on the effectiveness of treatments specific for the myocardial injury are needed.\nConclusions\nMyocardial injury has a significant association with fatal outcomes of COVID-19, while the prognosis of patients with underlying CVD but without myocardial injury appears relatively favorable. Myocardial injury is associated with impairment of cardiac function and ventricular tachyarrhythmias. Inflammation may be associated with myocardial injury. Aggressive treatment may be considered for the patients with myocardial injury.\nBack to top\nArticle Information\nCorresponding Author: Zhibing Lu, MD, Department of Cardiology (luzhibing222@163.com), and Xinghuan Wang, MD, Department of Urology (wangxinghuan@whu.edu.cn), Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, 169 East Lake Rd, Wuhan 430071, Hubei, China.\nAccepted for Publication: March 9, 2020.\nPublished Online: March 27, 2020. doi:10.1001/jamacardio.2020.1017\nOpen Access: This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the CC-BY License. \u00a9 2020 Guo T et al.

Even if capacity to provide care is sufficient, one priority should be addressing goals of care in the setting of acute life-threatening illness, especially for patients with chronic, life-limiting disease.\nClinicians should ensure patients receive the care they want, aligning the care that is delivered with patients\u2019 values and goals. The importance of goal-concordant care is not new or even substantially different in the context of this pandemic, but the importance of providing goal-concordant care is now heightened in several ways. Patients most likely to develop severe illness will be older and have greater burden of chronic illness\u2014exactly those who may wish to forgo prolonged life support and who may find their quality of life unacceptable after prolonged life support.1 In addition, recent reports suggest that survival may be substantially lower when acute respiratory distress syndrome is associated with COVID-19 vs when it is associated with other etiologies.2,3\nIn this context, advance care planning prior to serious acute illness and discussions about goals of care at the onset of serious acute illness should be a high priority for 3 reasons. First, clinicians should always strive to avoid intensive life-sustaining treatments when unwanted by patients. Second, avoiding nonbeneficial or unwanted high-intensity care becomes especially important in times of stress on health care capacity. Third, provision of nonbeneficial or unwanted high-intensity care may put other patients, family members, and health care workers at higher risk of transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. Now is the time to implement advance care planning to ensure patients do not receive care they would not want if they become too severely ill to make their own decisions. As eloquently pointed out by an intensivist, \u201cIf you do not talk with [your family] about this now, you may have to have a much more difficult conversation with me later.\u201d4 Several online resources can guide these advance care planning discussions.5-7\nFor patients in a community setting or living in a nursing home, clinicians should engage in discussions about goals of care now, especially with older patients with chronic disease. During this pandemic when nonessential medical visits are currently limited, these conversations may need to occur via telemedicine (either as a stand-alone appointment or in combination with an appointment designated or scheduled for another purpose). This process should include primary care and specialty clinicians (eg, cardiologists, pulmonologists, nephrologists, oncologists, and geriatricians), and patients might appreciate this opportunity to discuss advance care planning. Depending on state regulations, patients with chronic life-limiting illness should be offered the option to complete a physician order for life-sustaining treatments form, especially if they would not want to receive cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) or mechanical ventilation.\nFor hospitalized patients, one focal point for goal-concordant care is related to discussions of code status or the use of CPR and advanced cardiac life support (ACLS). Many hospital-based clinicians overemphasize code status as the first step of a goals-of-care discussion, but asking patients about CPR before assessing values and goals leads to ineffective code status discussions. During this pandemic, it is equally important to understand a patient\u2019s values and goals prior to discussing code status; however, the importance of avoiding inappropriate CPR has increased for 2 reasons. One reason is that although unwanted or nonbeneficial CPR under any circumstance may risk increasing psychological distress for patients\u2019 family members,8 inappropriate CPR during the pandemic is especially stressful and potentially dangerous for health care workers. Another reason is that nonbeneficial or unwanted ACLS will strain available resources for personal protective equipment because multiple health care workers are needed for effective ACLS. Therefore, the COVID-19 pandemic heightens the importance of implementing do-not-resuscitate (DNR) orders for appropriate hospitalized patients.\nThe implementation of DNR orders can occur in 3 situations. First, patients or their surrogate decision makers may clearly understand and communicate that the patient would not want CPR if the heart were to stop and may even have a physician\u2019s order for life-sustaining treatments form that specifies such. Second, patients or their surrogate decision makers may follow the recommendation of a clinician to forgo CPR; this may occur through informed consent or, occasionally, informed assent (as discussed below).9 Third, in extreme situations in which CPR cannot possibly be effective, clinicians in some health care settings may unilaterally decide to write a DNR order.10 This latter approach is not uniformly accepted and, prior to COVID-19, it rarely had a role. During this pandemic, however, in extreme situations such as a patient with severe underlying chronic illness and acute cardiopulmonary failure who is getting worse despite maximal therapy, there may be a role for a unilateral DNR to reduce the risk of medically futile CPR to patients, families, and health care workers.10\nInformed assent may be a more acceptable approach to code status discussions than medical futility and may be useful for patients in whom CPR is exceedingly unlikely to allow a successful return to a quality of life they would find acceptable.9 The Figure provides a proposed guide for an approach to having an informed assent discussion with a patient or family member of a patient for whom the clinician believes CPR is not indicated. The advantage of informed assent over a more traditional informed consent approach is that the clinician does not ask the patient or designated family member to take responsibility for the decision but rather asks the patient or family member to allow the clinician to assume responsibility. Some family members may be willing to permit clinicians to make this decision while simultaneously being unable to accept responsibility themselves, even if they agree, because of the psychological burden it places on them. In this setting, informed assent may provide family members a way to agree with the clinician\u2019s determination without assuming responsibility. Importantly, this approach places great responsibility on clinicians to enact careful prognostication and thoughtful, respectful, open communication with family members. This same responsibility is also present for informed consent.\nFigure.  Proposed Components of Informed Assent Framework\nView LargeDownload\nThe COVID-19 pandemic is placing tremendous stress on health care systems. There are many important components of an appropriate response to this pandemic, including public health measures to reduce rapidity and extent of spread. Another important element of the best possible response is to ensure that clinicians have high-quality discussions both about advance care planning for individuals in the community, especially those of older age and with chronic illness, and about goals of care with patients or their families when patients have illness that requires hospitalization.\nBack to top\nArticle Information\nCorresponding Author: J.

As of March 2020, ClinicalTrials.gov listed 262\u202f366 ongoing randomized clinical trials, including 146\u202f420 trials studying drug or biologic interventions, 85\u202f045 trials of behavioral interventions, and 61\u202f351 trials of surgical or device interventions.1 Suddenly, and quite dramatically, the coronavirus pandemic threatens the integrity of these clinical trials. The National Institutes of Health has advised investigators to consult with their institutional review boards and institutions about potential measures to protect participants and research staff. Responses from academic medical center and other research groups have varied from mandatory suspension of research involving human participants (except when this increases risk to participants) to relying on principal investigator discretion.\nCoronavirus mitigation efforts include self-isolation and avoiding health care centers where symptomatic patients congregate for medical care and where randomized trials are typically conducted. Mitigation efforts interfere with all aspects of a successful clinical trial: efficient accrual and randomization, intervention adherence and delivery, and outcome collection. Those most susceptible to severe consequences of coronavirus, older individuals and those with chronic disease, are commonly included in randomized trials designed to improve health in these vulnerable populations.\nWhen considering the risks and benefits of continuing clinical trials during the pandemic, one approach is to discontinue randomized trials that do not provide an immediate clear benefit to enrolled participants. However, benefits of therapeutic interventions in randomized trials are unknown until the trial is completed. Ongoing trials have potential to benefit millions of people with debilitating chronic diseases long after the coronavirus pandemic has ended. Furthermore, discontinuing ongoing trials wastes previously invested resources and squanders the time and effort of participants who may have already completed the trial. In contrast, sustaining ongoing trials could help millions of people realize substantial, durable health benefits that will be important once the coronavirus pandemic ends. Therefore, efforts and resources should be dedicated to support continuing randomized trials using creative and thoughtful methods and proactive planning. Adapting protocols to facilitate continued intervention adherence, outcome measurement, and some aspects of recruitment for trials already underway is likely to have the greatest benefit for the most people.\nThe following solutions may minimize disruption and preserve integrity of ongoing randomized clinical trials, while ensuring participant health and safety. These recommendations consider that the coronavirus pandemic has confined many staff and most participants to their homes, unable to visit a medical center for clinical trial activities. Each trial is unique, and the suggestions below will not be applicable to all trials. For example, risks of clinical trial participation during the coronavirus pandemic are different for a patient with end-stage cancer, for whom the clinical trial provides the only hope of survival, than for a patient with peripheral artery disease enrolled in a trial of a novel exercise intervention. For all clinical trials, however, research staff should keep participants informed about the effects of the coronavirus pandemic on their trial participation. Participants should be informed of necessary changes in protocol and how this may affect the risk associated with study participation. For many randomized trials, communication from research staff is likely to help protect against dropout or nonadherence by reassuring participants that their trial involvement remains important, even during the pandemic.\nCollection of outcome data requires thoughtful consideration. First, outcomes should be prioritized. The primary outcome has highest priority, whereas outcomes that are exploratory or not prespecified are more appropriate to eliminate temporarily. Second, alternative methods for measuring primary outcomes that cannot be collected in-person should be prepared and protocols modified to facilitate collection of alternative self-reported or medical record data that can be adjudicated as a surrogate for the primary outcome. Once the trial resumes, collection of both the original outcome and the surrogate \u201cremote\u201d data allows better understanding of how the self-reported or medical record data can best be used to impute an objective measure that temporarily was not attainable. For example, self-report and medical record data from participants could be used to impute a 400-m walk outcome.2\nThird, outcomes that can be collected remotely (ie, self-administered outcomes or outcomes collected by telephone or online) should be continued. Fourth, questionnaires previously collected in person can be converted to telephone administration. Self-administered questionnaires previously collected at an in-person visit can be mailed. Fifth, when feasible and when safe, objective outcomes could be collected at home. Sixth, when a high-priority outcome cannot be obtained at home, such as a 6-minute walk test, which requires a 100-foot hallway, consideration can be given to outcome collection off-site, away from the medical center, where exposure to potentially infectious individuals is minimized. However, collecting data off-site depends on local mandates and will not be feasible when all individuals are advised to stay home.\nDelivery of intervention requires thoughtful consideration, emphasizing safety and feasibility under coronavirus restrictions. Interventions that can be safely adhered to without leaving home should be continued. In addition, when safe to do so, it may be appropriate to continue interventions, such as medications, beyond the originally intended stop date. For example, a 6-month drug or behavioral intervention could be extended by an additional 2 or 3 months, so that follow-up testing can be carried out while the participant is still receiving the intervention once isolation restrictions are lifted. If it becomes necessary to temporarily discontinue the intervention when necessary monitoring cannot take place, the intervention could potentially be resumed once restrictions are removed, to preserve originally planned intervention duration and outcome measure timing as much as possible. Moreover, some interventions may require modification to accommodate the inability of participants to attend behavioral interventions requiring group visits or exercise sessions at a gym. A supervised exercise session could be temporarily converted to a home-based session with remote monitoring\u2014for example, by telephone, telecommunication tools such as Skype, or the internet\u2014if feasible and safe. Virtual interventions are additional alternatives.\nAnother consideration is how the intervention might interact with coronavirus infection and whether the study drug should be continued if a participant becomes ill with symptoms of coronavirus. Conceivably, some interventions could improve outcomes. For example, a trial testing efficacy of a therapy such as a statin might mitigate the cardiovascular consequences of an acute inflammatory state. If continuing the intervention becomes untenable, intention-to-treat methods are essential for understanding risks and protective factors for infection, illness, or recovery.\nAdditional considerations follow. First, while baseline in-person visits will not be possible during the pandemic, self-isolation facilitates telephone eligibility screening by staff working from home, who may have few other study activities they can carry out. Potentially eligible participants who are identified should be encouraged to attend study visits later. Second, alternate contact information, including cell phone and email addresses for family members and friends (at least 3) should be requested in the event that contact is lost with the participant. Third, when study visits are essential, investigators may help participants avoid public transportation, or shared ride services, where risk of disease exposure may be greater. Instead, participants could travel in their own car or obtain a ride from a friend or study staff member. Fourth, when in-person visits are continued, participants should be advised of the potential risk of leaving their home and offered the opportunity to decline. These participants may be willing to resume participation after the pandemic.\nFifth, experienced staff conducting randomized trials may be at risk for lost wages, especially if they were temporary workers whose primary duties were in-person data collection or if they have childcare needs that prevent them from working. Providing work-from-home opportunities, such as making additional retention telephone calls, will help retain this valuable workforce. Sixth, the US Food and Drug Administration has released guidance with additional suggestions for continuing randomized trials during the coronavirus pandemic, emphasizing participant safety and the importance of maintaining clinical trial integrity as much as possible.3 Seventh, the clinical trial community should consider scaling back or placing selected trials on hold, if doing so does not substantially harm the trials, so that investigators and research personnel can shift from their own ongoing trials to work on urgent trials of interventions to address the coronavirus pandemic, such as trials of therapeutic interventions for coronavirus.\nThe senior editorial staff at JAMA recognize the importance of staff and patient safety during this pandemic. Clinical trials often have challenges; in this case, all changes because of the pandemic should be described in the Methods section when the manuscript is submitted for publication.\nClinical trials require years to design, fund, conduct, and complete but are essential for improving health and preventing disability. The effects of the coronavirus pandemic on randomized trials hopefully will be short-lived, relative to the long-term benefits of these trials to millions of people who will continue to live with debilitating medical diseases after the crisis ends. To maximize public health benefits, creativity and persistence are required, especially during these unprecedented and uncertain times.\nBack to top\nArticle Information\nCorresponding Author: Mary M.

Neither the 2009 pandemic influenza A(H1N1) virus ([H1N1]pdm09) pandemic or the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) or the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) epidemics had the combination of both high transmissibility and severity. Control strategies are driven by this combination. R0, the basic reproduction number, is a commonly used measure of transmissibility and is defined as the number of additional persons one case infects over the course of their illness. An R0 of less than 1 indicates the infection will die out \u201ceventually.\u201d An R0 of greater than 1 indicates the infection has the potential for sustained transmission.\nFor example, influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, first identified in southern California on April 15, 2009, was highly transmissible. By May 5, 2009, influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 had spread to 41 US states and 21 countries.1 While influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 was highly transmissible, it was not severe. Initial estimates of the R0 of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 were 1.7.2 Although an estimated 201\u202f200 respiratory deaths due to influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 occurred during the first year of the pandemic, the number of deaths per population was 30\u2009times\u2009lower than that seen during the 1968 influenza pandemic, 1000 times less than the 1918 pandemic, and even less than typical seasonal influenza epidemics (estimated by the World Health Organization [WHO] to be 250\u202f000 to 500\u202f000 per year, although estimation methods differ).3 Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 was highly transmissible but not severe.\nSARS-CoV (2003) and MERS-CoV (2012-current) cause severe disease, but despite the initial R0 estimations of greater than 2.0 for SARS-CoV (indicating sustained and even worldwide transmission could occur), and some large outbreaks, neither were as transmissible as initial concerns suggested. SARS-CoV caused 8098 reported cases and 774 deaths (case-fatality rate, 9.6%) in 37 countries before the epidemic was controlled. Control was thought to have been possible because a high proportion of cases were severe, making it easier to rapidly identify and isolate infected individuals. In addition, the virus was present at lower levels in upper airway secretions. There was no secondary transmission in the United States from the 8 imported cases, although in Toronto, Canada, a single importation is thought to have led to about 400 cases and 44 deaths. Later estimates of R0 were less than 1, indicating that SARS-CoV may not have been capable of sustained transmission, especially in the setting of control measures.4\nSimilarly, MERS-CoV appears to have high severity and low transmissibility. Since 2012, MERS-CoV has caused 2494 reported cases and 858 deaths (case-fatality rate, 34%) in 27 countries. MERS-CoV has also caused some rapid outbreaks, mainly in hospitals in Saudi Arabia, Jordan, and South Korea, but estimates of MERS-CoV R0 are less than 1, and thus far it has been contained.5\nCan a respiratory virus that is both transmissible and severe be contained? In preparation for an influenza pandemic, the US Department of Health and Human Services\u2019 Pandemic Influenza Plan included a combination of nonpharmaceutical (border and school closing, infection control measures) and pharmaceutical (antiviral prophylaxis, vaccines) interventions meant to be used in combination to interrupt or slow influenza transmission. Despite implementation of some of these interventions, influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 spread to 120 countries in 3 months.\nWith the emergence of MERS-CoV in the Middle East, a preparedness plan was developed that included a surveillance plan, laboratory testing, and contact tracing guidance. Infection control guidance was developed for use in health care settings and traveler guidance was developed for the public.6 The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) distributed MERS-CoV polymerase chain reaction test kits to state health departments. Two cases were imported into the United States. Contacts were traced, including household, hospital, and airline contacts. No secondary cases were identified in the United States. MERS-CoV was thought to be severe and control measures relied on recognition of suspect cases. However, during a hospital outbreak in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, among hospitalized patients only 5 of 53 (9%) health care\u2013associated cases had documented presence in the same room as a patient with MERS.5 Despite the high case-fatality rate (an important measure of severity), MERS cases can be asymptomatic and mild (25% in one outbreak). Although it is not known how often asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic patients transmit MERS, initiating comprehensive measures such as isolating patients suspected of having or having been exposed to the virus and using personal protective equipment when caring for them may be extremely difficult because so many patients have mild and nonspecific symptoms.\nIs the world ready for a respiratory virus with high transmissibility and severity? After a new influenza virus (H7N9) was identified in China in 2013, a series of modeling articles described the effect of, and level of preparedness for, a severe, single-wave pandemic in the United States.7 In scenarios that used clinical attack rates (the proportion of individuals who become ill with or die from a disease in a population initially uninfected) of 20% to 30% (for comparison the clinical attack rate was 20% in the first year of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic), depending on severity there would be an estimated 669\u202f000 to 4.3 million hospitalizations and an estimated 54\u202f000 to 538\u202f000 deaths without any interventions in the United States. The models suggested that without a vaccine, school closures would be unlikely to affect the pandemic, an estimated 35\u202f000 to 60\u202f000 ventilators would be needed, up to an estimated 7.3 billion surgical masks or respirators would be required, and perhaps most important, if vaccine development did not start before the virus was introduced, it was unlikely that a significant number of hospitalizations and deaths could be averted due to the time it takes to develop, test, manufacture, and distribute a vaccine.\nIt is impossible to know what will happen so early in this novel 2019 coronavirus (2019-nCoV) epidemic. The scope, morbidity, and mortality will depend on the combination of severity and transmissibility. Numerous experts have \u201cnowcasted\u201d how many cases have occurred and forecasted how many cases will likely occur. A recent study suggests rapid person to person transmission can occur.8 Disease modelers have estimated R0 to be 2.2.9 The University of Hong Kong estimates the outbreak could infect more than 150\u202f000 persons per day in China at its peak.\nIs 2019-nCoV infection severe? To date approximately 14% of cases of 2019-nCoV have been described as severe by WHO, with a case-fatality rate of 2.1%.10 Estimates of severity are usually higher in the beginning of an epidemic due to the identification of the most severely affected cases and decline as the epidemic progresses. However, because many infected persons have not yet recovered and may still die, the case-fatality rate and severity could be underestimated. On January 30, 2020, WHO officially declared the 2019-nCoV epidemic as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern, indicating its concern that countries aside from China could be affected by 2019-nCoV.\nIn preparing for possible sustained transmission of 2019-nCoV beyond China, applicable lessons from previous experiences with epidemics/pandemics of respiratory viruses should be carefully considered to better control and mitigate potential consequences. Influenza preparedness plans have been developed that aim to stop, slow, or limit the spread of an influenza pandemic to the United States. These plans address limiting domestic spread and mitigating disease but also sustaining infrastructure and reducing the adverse effects of the pandemic on the economy and society. These plans would be useful to enact during the 2019-nCoV epidemic should the United States experience sustained transmission. Countries have been successful in the past and there is nothing yet to predict that this time it is likely to be worse. Effective prevention and control will not be easy if there is sustained transmission and will require the full attention of public health, federal and local governments, the private sector, and every citizen.\nBack to top\nArticle Information\nCorresponding Author: David L.

Due to the high contagiousness of COVID-19 and the current lack of any effective vaccine or drug, scientists and physicians are conducting a series of clinical studies involving affected patients. In 2016, the World Health Organization (WHO) published \u201cGuidance for Managing Ethical Issues in Infectious Disease\u201d2 to ensure the scientific validity of and participants\u2019 rights and safety in studies conducted during outbreaks. The guidance stated that there is a moral obligation to conduct timely scientific research. The Ethics Committee of the Henan Provincial People\u2019s Hospital reviewed the COVID-19 studies from the hospital based on those guidelines.\nMethods\nHenan Provincial People's Hospital is a designated hospital for COVID-19. The ethics committee designed a review system for research proposals at the beginning of the epidemic, including the use of emergency video conference to review batches of project applications. Electronic documents were formally reviewed by the secretary and sent to members of the committee to review in advance of the meetings. Applications were voted on by quorum and members proposed clear reasons for the decisions and provided suggestions for revision after full discussion.\nWe examined all new applications for COVID-19\u2013related studies and meeting minutes from February 2 through March 7, 2020, categorized the study type, determined the approval rate and review time, and summarized the issues in research proposals and informed consent forms consistent with the WHO document. Follow-up reviews of ongoing non\u2013COVID-19 studies are not included in this study.\nResults\nEthics review conferences, held once every month in nonepidemic periods, were held 4 times in 35 days. The mean time was 2.13 days from application submissions until an initial review decision was made. For applications that required modifications, the mean time was 1.81 days for the resubmission to be reviewed again.\nForty-one applications were reviewed, including interventional studies (n\u2009=\u200921); diagnostic studies (n\u2009=\u20097); observational studies (n\u2009=\u200910); and other types (n\u2009=\u20093). Six (14.6%) were approved; 4 (9.8%), rejected; and 31 (75.6%), referred for modification.\nOf the 4 rejected applications, 2 were denied because 1 involved a new, unapproved interferon-alfa treatment and another involved traditional Chinese medicine with many potential adverse reactions, so the potential risks outweighed benefits. The other 2 studies were denied because the laboratory biosafety level was inadequate, which may have led to virus leakage.\nOf the 31 applications that required modifications, the issues with the research proposals and informed consent forms are indicated in Table 1 and Table 2. The most frequent issues with proposals were lack of statistical basis for the sample size calculation and deficiencies in inclusion and exclusion criteria. The most frequent issues with informed consent forms were that patients were not informed of the risks and that compensation was unreasonable.\nDiscussion\nDuring the outbreak, ethics committee review of COVID-19 studies at 1 hospital were conducted within a few days, more quickly than the 27 ethical reviews organized by the M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res ethics review board during the Ebola crisis, with a mean time of 12.4 days to provide a review after the initial request.3 However, the first-time study approval rate of 14.6 % was lower than 33.4% during the nonepidemic period in 2019 in the Henan Provincial People's Hospital, possibly reflecting researchers\u2019 inexperience and the hasty preparation of documents. Review standards were not lowered during the outbreak.\nThe high frequency of issues with the research proposals and informed consent forms reflect that during an outbreak, researchers may use experimental drugs on affected patients, relax inclusion and exclusion criteria, and fail to offer reasonable compensation or to inform vulnerable patients of trial risks. Because the climate of fear may induce patients to agree to participate in research, the ethics committee paid special attention to such issues.\nThis study was limited to a small number of studies considered by 1 ethics committee. Future studies of other ethics committees should be conducted.\nSection Editor: Jody W.

One hundred years ago, medical therapies and countermeasures were significantly limited, and information exchange that could facilitate any public health intervention primarily occurred by telephone, mail, or person-to-person interaction.\nNow, more than a century later, a novel coronavirus is the cause of a new global pandemic threatening millions of lives.1 Today, many methods of sharing information have been subsumed by giant social media platforms that have incredible speed, reach, and penetration. More than 2.9 billion individuals use social media regularly, and many for long stretches of time.2\nCurrent understanding of how these platforms can be harnessed to optimally support emergency response, resilience, and preparedness is not well understood. In this Viewpoint, we outline a framework for integrating social media as a critical tool in managing the current evolving pandemic as well as transforming aspects of preparedness and response for the future.\nDirecting People to Trusted Sources\nTo date, social media platforms have been important for disseminating information during the outbreak of coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19). The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the World Health Organization (WHO), numerous journals, and other health care organizations are regularly posting guidance across a host of platforms. Teams employed by larger social media platforms have also been involved in the response as searches for information about coronavirus are escalating and, at times, dominating conversations online.3,4 Facebook is using the news feed function to direct users to the WHO website and websites of local health authorities.3 Google Scholar has highlighted leading medical journals and other sites. Twitter and other social media sites are similarly pointing individuals who search (accounting for misspellings) for coronavirus-related content to reliable resources.4 Health care organizations, clinicians, and social media influencers should also actively direct online traffic to trusted sources.\nIt may also be time for social media platforms to take on an active public health role and in parallel use banners, pop-ups, and other tools to directly message users about hand washing and social distancing. This approach increases the likelihood of millions of people seeing the same messages whenever they access the platform, even if they forgo accessing the WHO website or other trusted sites.\nCounteracting Misinformation\nSocial media has also become a conduit for spreading both rumors and deliberate misinformation, and many perpetrators are deploying sites such as Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, and WhatsApp to create a sense of panic and confusion. Unlike any prior event, WHO has identified that the \u201cthe 2019-nCoV outbreak and response has been accompanied by a massive \u2018infodemic\u2019\u2014an over-abundance of information\u2014some accurate and some not\u2014that makes it hard for people to find trustworthy sources and reliable guidance.\u201d5 Research is needed to better understand the origins and spread of misinformation as well as coordinated efforts to disrupt its sources and identify, remove, and reduce its dissemination.\nSocial Media as a Diagnostic Tool and Referral System\nSocial media should be used to disseminate reliable information about when to get tested, what to do with the results, and where to receive care. If a vaccine becomes available, the same platforms could be used to encourage uptake and address challenges associated with vaccine hesitancy. These targeted efforts can occur in response to what people search for or in a more personalized approach based on an individual\u2019s online profile, posts, and underlying risk. Health systems may become overwhelmed as testing becomes more available and as more mildly ill yet concerned individuals seek care; yet, social media platforms are well poised to enable users to remotely assess symptoms and determine their most appropriate course of action.6 The Facebook Preventive Health tool provides individuals with vetted guidelines about preventive health recommendations (eg, heart disease, cancer screening) and then directs users to geotargeted locations (eg, federally qualified health centers, retail clinics) where these services are available. Users also have the option to share the tool and their scheduled testing with their network.7 This could be modified to direct individuals (when relevant) to resources for COVID-19 testing. For those whose test results are positive for COVID-19, the platform could enable users to inform their contacts about the potential exposure and how to follow up for testing.\nEnabling Connectivity and Psychological First Aid\nAs individuals start to self-quarantine and telecommute, new forms of social isolation are occurring. In some places in the US, funerals, weddings, religious services, in-restaurant dining, and other places of traditional socialization have already been severely limited or completely restricted. The long-term effects of social distancing and isolation will likely affect populations differently, necessitating comprehensive strategies for addressing the downstream sequelae. Navigating social isolation will be particularly challenging for already disadvantaged populations, such as older individuals, individuals with low socioeconomic status or housing insecurity, individuals managing chronic illnesses or disabilities, and individuals who are undocumented. Social media should be used to raise awareness about the needs of these groups in disasters and for development of new methods for communities to mobilize resources and support in the absence of physical contact. The \u201ccrisis response,\u201d \u201csafety check,\u201d and related functions available on some social media platforms could enable more frequent status updates and sharing.8 Psychological first aid could be delivered through chatbots that use artificial intelligence to learn from the millions of interactions that are occurring in response to the pandemic and better understand critical needs. While social media cannot replace in-person contact, there may be ways to better use it to support recovery and resilience.\nAdvancing Remote Learning\nNew approaches to enhance the education of health care professionals is needed. Social distancing will affect clinical training (eg, emergency department rotation) and didactic education (eg, anatomy laboratory). Stand-alone video conferencing services may be overwhelmed as many institutions move entirely online. Social media can be a useful tool for facilitating contact among students and supporting active learning. Front-line health care clinicians and other health care workers who provide care for critically ill patients with COVID-19 would also benefit from being able to share their experiences broadly in a deidentified way to advance education and teaching in an evolving crisis.\nAccelerating Research\nSocial media data about symptoms, interactions, photos at events, travel routes, and other digital footprints about human behavior should be analyzed in real time to understand and model the transmission and trajectory of COVID-19. At present, Facebook is providing aggregated and anonymized data to researchers about how people move from location to location and associated population density maps to better inform how the virus is spreading. Merged social media data and electronic medical record data from consenting patients could also provide insights about individual-level risk.9 Basic and translational science can also be advanced through social media channels. Foundations have funded researchers to sequence the complete genome of COVID-19 in a short period of time. The output of these efforts included a research tool to further analyze the genome and a cell atlas that can be used to study how COVID-19 affects different organ functions. This infrastructure can be strengthened to facilitate communication among scientists working to address critical priorities related to animal and environmental research and candidate therapeutics and vaccines.\nEnabling a Culture of Preparedness\nMore than 100 years ago, a global pandemic affected more than 500 million people worldwide. Today, in the midst of another public health emergency, some lessons from history demonstrate the importance of understanding how information spreads and individuals interact. Integrating social media as an essential tool in preparedness, response, and recovery can influence the response to COVID-19 and future public health threats.\nBack to top\nArticle Information\nCorresponding Author: Raina M.

By December 31 the World Health Organization (WHO) regional office in Beijing had received notification of a cluster of patients with pneumonia of unknown cause from the same city.1 Wuhan, the capital city of Hubei Province in central China, is the nation\u2019s seventh largest city, with a population of 11 million people. Over the next few days, researchers at the Wuhan Institute of Virology performed metagenomics analysis using next-generation sequencing from a sample collected from a bronchoalveolar lavage and identified a novel coronavirus as the potential etiology. They called it novel coronavirus 2019 (nCoV-2019).2 The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) refers to it as 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).3\nAs of February 4, 2020, more than 20\u202f000 cases of 2019-nCoV have been reported, 98.9% of them in China, and the outbreak is linked to more than 400 deaths. As the epidemic is evolving and the situation is rapidly changing, up-to-date reliable information on the number of cases and recommendations on management of cases and preventive interventions can be found at various sites, including the webpage developed by the CDC.3 Currently the number of infections outside of China remains small (approximately 180), but cases have been detected in 26 countries, including 11 cases in the United States.\nWhile it is unclear how many people are truly infected, a modeling study suggests that as of January 25, 2020, 75\u202f815 individuals have been infected in Wuhan alone.4 The authors calculated the basic reproductive number (the number of cases one infected individual generates), R0, of this outbreak to be 2.68 (95% CI, 2.47-2.86) and that the epidemic is doubling every 6.4 days. Because of extensive travel between China and cities like Bangkok, Hong Kong, Singapore, Tokyo, and Taipei, these locations have identified the majority of cases outside of mainland China. As testing becomes more frequent, the true number of cases and the full spectrum of disease will become more clear. However, for now, it appears that compared with the other 2 zoonotic coronaviruses that occurred in the last 20 years (severe acute respiratory syndrome [SARS] in 2002 and Middle East respiratory syndrome [MERS] in 2012), 2019-nCoV seems to have greater infectivity (eg, a higher R0) and a lower case fatality rate.1\nFrom genetic sequencing data, it appears that there was a single introduction into humans followed by human-to-human spread. This novel virus shares 79.5% of genetic sequence with SARS-CoV and has 96.2% homology to a bat coronavirus.2 In addition, 2019-nCoV shares the same cell entry receptor, ACE2, with SARS-CoV. What is yet unclear is which animal is the intermediate species between bats and humans. For SARS it was civet cats, for MERS it is camels. While the source of 2019-CoV is yet unknown, early on the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market was linked epidemiologically.1,5\nThe incubation period of this virus has been reported to be 5.2 days (95% CI, 4.1-7.0),6 although there is suggestion that it may be as long as 14 days. It is unclear when transmission begins and, although cases have been reported that suggest transmission during the asymptomatic phase, it is likely that the majority of secondary cases come from symptomatic individuals.\nThe clinical syndrome is nonspecific and characterized by fever and dry cough in the majority of patients, with about a third experiencing shortness of breath. Some patients have other symptoms such as myalgias, headache, sore throat, and diarrhea7. The median age of patients is between 49 and 56 years.7,8 Cases in children have been rare. Although most cases appear to be mild, all patients admitted to the hospital have pneumonia with infiltrates on chest x-ray and ground glass opacities on chest computed tomography.8,9 About a third of patients subsequently developed acute respiratory distress syndrome and required care in the intensive care unit. This is particularly true for patients with comorbid conditions such as diabetes or hypertension.8\nWhen a patient presents with fever and respiratory symptoms (in particular a dry cough), clinicians should obtain a detailed travel history. If the patient has a history of travel to Hubei Province in the last 14 days, they should be considered a person under investigation (PUI) (Figure).\nFigure.  Criteria to Guide Evaluation of Patients Under Investigation for 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV)\nView LargeDownload\nAdapted from the CDC.3\nIn the event of a PUI, clinicians should immediately notify their health care facility\u2019s infection prevention team as well as their local or state health department. State health departments then notify the CDC\u2019s Emergency Operations Center. At this time diagnostic testing for 2019-nCoV is conducted only at the CDC, but this is expected to change soon to include state health departments. Clinicians should test for other respiratory pathogens; given that this is influenza season, clinicians should consider prescribing oseltamivir pending results of influenza testing. There is little value to wearing a regular face mask absent a high probability of being exposed to coronavirus, but when there is a high degree of suspicion that a patient might have 2019-nCoV, they should have a face mask placed immediately and health care practitioners should wear N95 respirators.\nTo date, the management of infection has been largely supportive. Lopinavir/ritonavir is being investigated (Chinese clinical trial registry identifier: ChiCTR2000029308) based on previous studies suggesting possible clinical benefit in SARS and MERS.1 In addition, remdesivir, available through compassionate use, has also been tried and this latter antiviral was used in the first US patient identified.9\nIn response to the outbreak, on January 23, 2020, Chinese authorities suspended travel in and out of Wuhan.10 Similar travel bans followed in other cities in Hubei Province, and in total close to 50 million people have been quarantined, an unprecedented effort to control any infectious disease. Similarly, other countries have responded by suspending travel to and from China and establishing screening at airports that have flights from China. The WHO on January 30 declared the outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (and the US State Department has increased the alert level to 4, recommending that citizens not travel to China). On January 31 the Trump administration took the unprecedented action to suspend entry into the United States of all immigrants and nonimmigrants who have physically been in China, Hong Kong, or Macau in the previous 14 days. All US citizens and permanent residents who have been in Hubei Province in the last 14 days will also be subject to quarantine. The effectiveness of these quarantines in curtailing the outbreak is doubtful because these measures have not worked in prior outbreaks, such as the 2009 influenza A(H1N1) or the 2014 Ebola pandemics, and quarantines are contrary to previously proven public health measures and the International Health Regulations.10\nWhat interventions will ultimately control this outbreak is unclear because there is currently no vaccine, and the effectiveness of antivirals is unproven. However, basic public health measures such as staying home when ill, handwashing, and respiratory etiquette including covering the mouth and nose during sneezing and coughing were effective in controlling SARS. As a new outbreak confronts frontline clinicians and public health authorities, these groups must work together to educate the public by providing accurate and up-to-date information and by taking care of patients with respiratory illness in a timely and effective way.\nBack to top\nArticle Information\nCorresponding Author: Carlos del Rio, MD, Emory University School of Medicine, 69 Jesse Hill Jr Dr, FOB Room 201, Atlanta, GA 30303 (cdelrio@emory.edu).\nPublished Online: February 5, 2020. doi:10.1001/jama.2020.1490\nConflict of Interest Disclosures: Dr Del Rio reports receiving grants from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health.

The etiology of these infections was a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV),1,2 possibly connected to zoonotic or environmental exposure from the seafood market in Wuhan. Human-to-human transmission has accounted for most of the infections, including among health care workers.3,4 The virus has spread to different parts of China and at least 26 other countries.1 A high number of men have been infected, and the reported mortality rate has been approximately 2%, which is lower than that reported from other coronavirus epidemics including severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS; mortality rate, >40% in patients aged >60 years)5 and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS; mortality rate, 30%).6 However, little is known about the clinical manifestations of 2019-nCoV in healthy populations or cases outside Wuhan. We report early clinical features of 13 patients with confirmed 2019-nCoV infection admitted to hospitals in Beijing.\nMethods\nData were obtained from 3 hospitals in Beijing, China (Beijing Tsinghua Changgung Hospital, School of Medicine, Tsinghua University [8 patients], Beijing Anzhen Hospital, Capital Medical University [4 patients], and College of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, Chinese PLA General Hospital [1 patient]). Patients were hospitalized from January 16, 2020, to January 29, 2020, with final follow-up for this report on February 4, 2020. Patients with possible 2019-nCoV were admitted and quarantined, and throat swab samples were collected and sent to the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention for detection of 2019-nCoV using a quantitative polymerase chain reaction assay.3 Chest radiography or computed tomography was performed. Data were obtained as part of standard care. Patients were transferred to a specialized hospital after diagnosis. This study was approved by the ethics commissions of the 3 hospitals, with a waiver of informed consent.\nResults\nThe median age of the patients was 34 years (25th-75th percentile, 34-48 years); 2 patients were children (aged 2 years and 15 years), and 10 (77%) were male. Twelve patients either visited Wuhan, including a family (parents and son), or had family members (grandparents of the 2-year-old child) who visited Wuhan after the onset of the 2019-nCoV epidemic (mean stay, 2.5 days). One patient did not have any known contact with Wuhan.\nTwelve patients reported fever (mean, 1.6 days) before hospitalization. Symptoms included cough (46.3%), upper airway congestion (61.5%), myalgia (23.1%), and headache (23.1%) (Table). No patient required respiratory support before being transferred to the specialty hospital after a mean of 2 days. The youngest patient (aged 2 years) had intermittent fever for 1 week and persistent cough for 13 days before 2019-nCoV diagnosis. Levels of inflammatory markers such as C-reactive protein were elevated, and numbers of lymphocytes were marginally elevated (Table).\nFour patients had chest radiographs and 9 had computed tomography. Five images did not demonstrate any consolidation or scarring. One chest radiograph demonstrated scattered opacities in the left lower lung; in 6 patients, ground glass opacity was observed in the right or both lungs (Figure). As of February 4, 2020, all the patients recovered, but 12 were still being quarantined in the hospital.\nDiscussion\nThe current coronavirus outbreak in China is the third epidemic caused by coronavirus in the 21st century, already surpassing SARS and MERS in the number of individuals infected.1 The higher number of infections may be attributable to late identification of the etiologic agent and the ability of the host to shed the infection while asymptomatic, rather than to greater infectivity of the virus compared with SARS.3\nThis case series provides information on the epidemiology of the disease outside Wuhan. Most patients visited or came in close contact with individuals from Wuhan, but 1 patient did not, suggesting possible active viral transmission in Beijing. Close monitoring will be needed to prevent large-scale spread of the virus to other cities in China.\nMost of the infected patients were healthy adults; only 1 patient was older than 50 years and 1 younger than 5 years. This might be related to limited travel by younger and older patients rather than decreased susceptibility of these populations. Recovery of all patients suggests milder infections. The study is limited by lack of detailed data after transfer. These data contribute information to understanding the early clinical manifestations of 2019-nCoV.\nSection Editor: Jody W.

Presumed human-to-human hospital-associated transmission of 2019-nCoV was suspected in 41% of patients.\nMeaning  In this case series in Wuhan, China, NCIP was frequently associated with presumed hospital-related transmission, 26% of patients required intensive care unit treatment, and mortality was 4.3%.\nAbstract\nImportance  In December 2019, novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV)\u2013infected pneumonia (NCIP) occurred in Wuhan, China. The number of cases has increased rapidly but information on the clinical characteristics of affected patients is limited.\nObjective  To describe the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of NCIP.\nDesign, Setting, and Participants  Retrospective, single-center case series of the 138 consecutive hospitalized patients with confirmed NCIP at Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University in Wuhan, China, from January 1 to January 28, 2020; final date of follow-up was February 3, 2020.\nExposures  Documented NCIP.\nMain Outcomes and Measures  Epidemiological, demographic, clinical, laboratory, radiological, and treatment data were collected and analyzed. Outcomes of critically ill patients and noncritically ill patients were compared. Presumed hospital-related transmission was suspected if a cluster of health professionals or hospitalized patients in the same wards became infected and a possible source of infection could be tracked.\nResults  Of 138 hospitalized patients with NCIP, the median age was 56 years (interquartile range, 42-68; range, 22-92 years) and 75 (54.3%) were men. Hospital-associated transmission was suspected as the presumed mechanism of infection for affected health professionals (40 [29%]) and hospitalized patients (17 [12.3%]). Common symptoms included fever (136 [98.6%]), fatigue (96 [69.6%]), and dry cough (82 [59.4%]). Lymphopenia (lymphocyte count, 0.8\u2009\u00d7\u2009109/L [interquartile range {IQR}, 0.6-1.1]) occurred in 97 patients (70.3%), prolonged prothrombin time (13.0 seconds [IQR, 12.3-13.7]) in 80 patients (58%), and elevated lactate dehydrogenase (261 U/L [IQR, 182-403]) in 55 patients (39.9%). Chest computed tomographic scans showed bilateral patchy shadows or ground glass opacity in the lungs of all patients. Most patients received antiviral therapy (oseltamivir, 124 [89.9%]), and many received antibacterial therapy (moxifloxacin, 89 [64.4%]; ceftriaxone, 34 [24.6%]; azithromycin, 25 [18.1%]) and glucocorticoid therapy (62 [44.9%]). Thirty-six patients (26.1%) were transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) because of complications, including acute respiratory distress syndrome (22 [61.1%]), arrhythmia (16 [44.4%]), and shock (11 [30.6%]). The median time from first symptom to dyspnea was 5.0 days, to hospital admission was 7.0 days, and to ARDS was 8.0 days. Patients treated in the ICU (n\u2009=\u200936), compared with patients not treated in the ICU (n\u2009=\u2009102), were older (median age, 66 years vs 51 years), were more likely to have underlying comorbidities (26 [72.2%] vs 38 [37.3%]), and were more likely to have dyspnea (23 [63.9%] vs 20 [19.6%]), and anorexia (24 [66.7%] vs 31 [30.4%]). Of the 36 cases in the ICU, 4 (11.1%) received high-flow oxygen therapy, 15 (41.7%) received noninvasive ventilation, and 17 (47.2%) received invasive ventilation (4 were switched to extracorporeal membrane oxygenation). As of February 3, 47 patients (34.1%) were discharged and 6 died (overall mortality, 4.3%), but the remaining patients are still hospitalized. Among those discharged alive (n\u2009=\u200947), the median hospital stay was 10 days (IQR, 7.0-14.0).\nConclusions and Relevance  In this single-center case series of 138 hospitalized patients with confirmed NCIP in Wuhan, China, presumed hospital-related transmission of 2019-nCoV was suspected in 41% of patients, 26% of patients received ICU care, and mortality was 4.3%.\nIntroduction\nIn December 2019, a cluster of acute respiratory illness, now known as novel coronavirus\u2013infected pneumonia (NCIP), occurred in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.1-5 The disease has rapidly spread from Wuhan to other areas. As of January 31, 2020, a total of 9692 NCIP cases in China have been confirmed. Internationally, cases have been reported in 24 countries and 5 continents.6 On January 3, 2020, the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) was identified in samples of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from a patient in Wuhan and was confirmed as the cause of the NCIP.7 Full-genome sequencing and phylogenic analysis indicated that 2019-nCoV is a distinct clade from the betacoronaviruses associated with human severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS).7 The 2019-nCoV has features typical of the coronavirus family and was classified in the betacoronavirus 2b lineage. The 2019-nCoV has close similarity to bat coronaviruses, and it has been postulated that bats are the primary source. While the origin of the 2019-nCoV is still being investigated, current evidence suggests spread to humans occurred via transmission from wild animals illegally sold in the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market.8\nHuang et al9 first reported 41 cases of NCIP in which most patients had a history of exposure to Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market. Patients\u2019 clinical manifestations included fever, nonproductive cough, dyspnea, myalgia, fatigue, normal or decreased leukocyte counts, and radiographic evidence of pneumonia. Organ dysfunction (eg, shock, acute respiratory distress syndrome [ARDS], acute cardiac injury, and acute kidney injury) and death can occur in severe cases.9 Subsequently, Chen et al8 reported findings from 99 cases of NCIP from the same hospital and the results suggested that the 2019-nCoV infection clustered within groups of humans in close contact, was more likely to affect older men with comorbidities, and could result in ARDS. However, the difference in clinical characteristics between severe and nonsevere cases was not reported. Case reports confirmed human-to-human transmission of NCIP.10,11 At present, there are no effective therapies or vaccines for NCIP. The objective of this case series was to describe the clinical characteristics of 138 hospitalized patients with NCIP and to compare severe cases who received intensive care unit (ICU) care with nonsevere cases who did not receive ICU care.\nMethods\nStudy Design and Participants\nThis case series was approved by the institutional ethics board of Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University (No. 2020020). All consecutive patients with confirmed NCIP admitted to Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University from January 1 to January 28, 2020, were enrolled. Oral consent was obtained from patients. Zhongnan Hospital, located in Wuhan, Hubei Province, the endemic areas of NCIP, is one of the major tertiary teaching hospitals and is responsible for the treatments for NCIP assigned by the government. All patients with NCIP enrolled in this study were diagnosed according to World Health Organization interim guidance.12 The clinical outcomes (ie, discharges, mortality, length of stay) were monitored up to February 3, 2020, the final date of follow-up.\nData Collection\nThe medical records of patients were analyzed by the research team of the Department of Critical Care Medicine, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University. Epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment and outcomes data were obtained with data collection forms from electronic medical records. The data were reviewed by a trained team of physicians. Information recorded included demographic data, medical history, exposure history, underlying comorbidities, symptoms, signs, laboratory findings, chest computed tomographic (CT) scans, and treatment measures (ie, antiviral therapy, corticosteroid therapy, respiratory support, kidney replacement therapy). The date of disease onset was defined as the day when the symptom was noticed. Symptoms, signs, laboratory values, chest CT scan, and treatment measures during the hospital stay were collected. ARDS was defined according to the Berlin definition.13 Acute kidney injury was identified according to the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes definition.14 Cardiac injury was defined if the serum levels of cardiac biomarkers (eg, troponin I) were above the 99th percentile upper reference limit or new abnormalities were shown in electrocardiography and echocardiography.9 For patients admitted to the ICU, the Glasgow Coma Scale, Sequential Organ Failure Assessment, and Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II scores were determined on the day of ICU admission. The durations from onset of disease to hospital admission, dyspnea, ARDS, and ICU admission were recorded.\nPresumed hospital-related transmission was suspected if a cluster of medical professionals or hospitalized patients in the same wards became infected in a certain time period and a possible source of infection could be tracked.\nReal-Time Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction Assay for nCoV\nThroat swab samples were collected for extracting 2019-nCoV RNA from patients suspected of having 2019-nCoV infection. After collection, the throat swabs were placed into a collection tube with 150 \u03bcL of virus preservation solution, and total RNA was extracted within 2 hours using the respiratory sample RNA isolation kit (Zhongzhi, Wuhan, China). In brief, 40 \u03bcL of cell lysates were transferred into a collection tube followed by vortex for 10 seconds. After standing at room temperature for 10 minutes, the collection tube was centrifugated at 1000 rpm/min for 5 minutes. The suspension was used for real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay of 2019-nCoV RNA. Two target genes, including open reading frame 1ab (ORF1ab) and nucleocapsid protein (N), were simultaneously amplified and tested during the real-time RT-PCR assay. Target 1 (ORF1ab): forward primer CCCTGTGGGTTTTACACTTAA; reverse primer ACGATTGTGCATCAGCTGA; and the probe 5\u2032-VIC-CCGTCTGCGGTATGTGGAAAGGTTATGG-BHQ1-3\u2032. Target 2 (N): forward primer GGGGAACTTCTCCTGCTAGAAT; reverse primer CAGACATTTTGCTCTCAAGCTG; and the probe 5\u2032-FAM- TTGCTGCTGCTTGACAGATT-TAMRA-3\u2032. The real-time RT-PCR assay was performed using a 2019-nCoV nucleic acid detection kit according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol (Shanghai bio-germ Medical Technology Co Ltd). Reaction mixture contains 12 \u03bcL of reaction buffer, 4 \u03bcL of enzyme solution, 4 \u03bcL of Probe primers solution, 3 \u03bcL of diethyl pyrocarbonate\u2013treated water, and 2 \u03bcL of RNA template. RT-PCR assay was performed under the following conditions: incubation at 50 \u00b0C for 15 minutes and 95 \u00b0C for 5 minutes, 40 cycles of denaturation at 94 \u00b0C for 15 seconds, and extending and collecting fluorescence signal at 55 \u00b0C for 45 seconds. A cycle threshold value (Ct-value) less than 37 was defined as a positive test result, and a Ct-value of 40 or more was defined as a negative test. These diagnostic criteria were based on the recommendation by the National Institute for Viral Disease Control and Prevention (China) (http://ivdc.chinacdc.cn/kyjz/202001/t20200121_211337.html). A medium load, defined as a Ct-value of 37 to less than 40, required confirmation by retesting.\nStatistical Analysis\nCategorical variables were described as frequency rates and percentages, and continuous variables were described using mean, median, and interquartile range (IQR) values. Means for continuous variables were compared using independent group t tests when the data were normally distributed; otherwise, the Mann-Whitney test was used. Data (nonnormal distribution) from repeated measures were compared using the generalized linear mixed model. Proportions for categorical variables were compared using the \u03c72 test, although the Fisher exact test was used when the data were limited. All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS (Statistical Package for the Social Sciences) version 13.0 software (SPSS Inc). For unadjusted comparisons, a 2-sided \u03b1 of less than .05 was considered statistically significant. The analyses have not been adjusted for multiple comparisons and, given the potential for type I error, the findings should be interpreted as exploratory and descriptive.\nResults\nPresenting Characteristics\nThe study population included 138 hospitalized patients with confirmed NCIP. The median age was 56 years (IQR, 42-68; range, 22-92 years), and 75 (54.3%) were men. Of these patients, 102 (73.9%) were admitted to isolation wards, and 36 (26.1%) were admitted and transferred to the ICU because of the development of organ dysfunction (Table 1). The median durations from first symptoms to dyspnea, hospital admission, and ARDS were 5 days (IQR, 1-10), 7 days (IQR, 4-8), and 8 days (IQR, 6-12), respectively (Table 1). Of the 138 patients, 64 (46.4%) had 1 or more coexisting medical conditions. Hypertension (43 [31.2%]), diabetes (14 [10.1%]), cardiovascular disease (20 [14.5%]), and malignancy (10 [7.2%]) were the most common coexisting conditions.\nThe most common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (136 [98.6%]), fatigue (96 [69.6%]), dry cough (82 [59.4%]), myalgia (48 [34.8%]), and dyspnea (43 [31.2%]). Less common symptoms were headache, dizziness, abdominal pain, diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting (Table 1). A total of 14 patients (10.1%) initially presented with diarrhea and nausea 1 to 2 days prior to development of fever and dyspnea.\nCompared with patients who did not receive ICU care (n\u2009=\u2009102), patients who required ICU care (n\u2009=\u200936) were significantly older (median age, 66 years [IQR, 57-78] vs 51 years [IQR, 37-62]; P\u2009<\u2009.001) and were more likely to have underlying comorbidities, including hypertension (21 [58.3%] vs 22 [21.6%], diabetes (8 [22.2%] vs 6 [5.9%]), cardiovascular disease (9 [25.0%] vs 11 [10.8%]), and cerebrovascular disease (6 [16.7%] vs 1 [1.0%]). Compared with the non-ICU patients, patients admitted to the ICU were more likely to report pharyngeal pain, dyspnea, dizziness, abdominal pain, and anorexia.\nVital Signs and Laboratory Parameters in ICU and Non-ICU Patients\nHeart rate, respiratory rate, and mean arterial pressure did not differ between patients who received ICU care and patients who did not receive ICU care. These measures were recorded on day of hospital admission for all patients, then divided into those who were later admitted to the ICU or not. There were numerous differences in laboratory findings between patients admitted to the ICU and those not admitted to the ICU (Table 2), including higher white blood cell and neutrophil counts, as well as higher levels of D-dimer, creatine kinase, and creatine. All of the 138 enrolled patients showed bilateral involvement of chest CT scan (Figure 1). The median time from onset of symptoms to ICU admission was 10 days (IQR, 6-12) (Table 3). On the day of ICU admission, the median Glasgow Coma Scale; Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II; and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment scores were 15 (IQR, 9-15), 17 (IQR, 10-22), and 5 (IQR, 3-6), respectively (Table 3). The median partial pressure of oxygen level was 68 mm Hg (IQR, 56-89) and the median of partial pressure of oxygen to fraction of inspired oxygen ratio was 136 mm Hg (IQR, 103-234).\nOrgan Dysfunctions and Main Interventions\nThe organ dysfunction and treatment of the 138 patients are shown in Table 4. As of February 3, 2020, 85 patients (61.6%) were still hospitalized. A total of 47 patients (34.1%) had been discharged, and 6 patients (4.3%) had died. Of the 36 patients admitted to the ICU, 11 were still in the ICU, 9 had been discharged to home, 10 had been transferred to the general wards, and 6 had died. Of the 11 patients who remained in the ICU, 6 received invasive ventilation (1 switched to extracorporeal membrane oxygenation) and 5 to noninvasive ventilations). Common complications among the 138 patients included shock (12 [8.7%]), ARDS (27 [19.6%]), arrhythmia (23 [16.7%]), and acute cardiac injury (10 [7.2%]). Patients who received care in the ICU were more likely to have one of these complications than non-ICU patients.\nMost patients received antiviral therapy (oseltamivir, 124 [89.9%]), and many received antibacterial therapy (moxifloxacin, 89 [64.4%]; ceftriaxone, 34 [24.6%]; azithromycin, 25 [18.1%]) and glucocorticoid therapy (62 [44.9%]). In the ICU, 4 patients (11.1%) received high-flow oxygen and 15 (44.4%) received noninvasive ventilation. Invasive mechanical ventilation was required in 17 patients (47.2%), 4 of whom received extracorporeal membrane oxygenation as rescue therapy. A total of 13 patients received vasopressors, and 2 patients received kidney replacement therapy.\nDynamic Profile of Laboratory Findings in Patients With NCIP\nTo determine the major clinical features that appeared during NCIP progression, the dynamic changes in 6 clinical laboratory parameters, including hematological and biochemical parameters, were tracked from day 1 to day 19 after the onset of the disease at 2-day intervals. At the end of January 28, 2020, data from 33 patients with complete clinical course were analyzed (Figure 2). During hospitalization, most patients had marked lymphopenia, and nonsurvivors developed more severe lymphopenia over time. White blood cell counts and neutrophil counts were higher in nonsurvivors than those in survivors. The level of D-dimer was higher in nonsurvivors than in survivors. Similarly, as the disease progressed and clinical status deteriorated, the levels of blood urea and creatinine progressively increased before death.\nPresumed Hospital-Related Transmission and Infection\nOf the 138 patients, 57 (41.3%) were presumed to have been infected in hospital, including 17 patients (12.3%) who were already hospitalized for other reasons and 40 health care workers (29%). Of the hospitalized patients, 7 patients were from the surgical department, 5 were from internal medicine, and 5 were from the oncology department. Of the infected health care workers, 31 (77.5%) worked on general wards, 7 (17.5%) in the emergency department, and 2 (5%) in the ICU. One patient in the current study presented with abdominal symptoms and was admitted to the surgical department. More than 10 health care workers in this department were presumed to have been infected by this patient. Patient-to-patient transmission also was presumed to have occurred, and at least 4 hospitalized patients in the same ward were infected, and all presented with atypical abdominal symptoms. One of the 4 patients had fever and was diagnosed as having nCoV infection during hospitalization. Then, the patient was isolated. Subsequently, the other 3 patients in the same ward had fever, presented with abdominal symptoms, and were diagnosed as having nCoV infection.\nDiscussion\nThis report, to our knowledge, is the largest case series to date of hospitalized patients with NCIP. As of February 3, 2020, of the 138 patients included in this study, 26% required ICU care, 34.1% were discharged, 6 died (4.3%), and 61.6% remain hospitalized. For those who were discharged (n\u2009=\u200947), the hospital stay was 10 days (IQR, 7.0-14.0). The time from onset to dyspnea was 5.0 days, 7.0 days to hospital admission, and 8.0 days to ARDS. Common symptoms at onset of illness were fever, dry cough, myalgia, fatigue, dyspnea, and anorexia. However, a significant proportion of patients presented initially with atypical symptoms, such as diarrhea and nausea. Major complications during hospitalization included ARDS, arrhythmia, and shock. Bilateral distribution of patchy shadows and ground glass opacity was a typical hallmark of CT scan for NCIP. Most critical ill patients were older and had more underlying conditions than patients not admitted to the ICU. Most patients required oxygen therapy and a minority of the patients needed invasive ventilation or even extracorporeal membrane oxygenation.\nThe data in this study suggest rapid person-to-person transmission of 2019-nCoV may have occurred. The main reason is derived from the estimation of the basic reproductive number (R0) based on a previous study.15 R0 indicates how contagious an infectious disease is. As an infection spreads to new people, it reproduces itself; R0 indicates the average number of additional individuals that one affected case infects during the course of their illness and specifically applies to a population of people who were previously free of infection and have not been vaccinated. Based on the report, R0 from nCoV is 2.2, which estimated that, on average, each patient has been spreading infection to 2.2 other people.15 One reason for the rapid spread may be related to the atypical symptoms in the early stage in some patients infected with nCoV.\nA recent study showed that nCoV was detected in stool samples of patients with abdominal symptoms.16 However, it is difficult to differentiate and screen patients with atypical symptoms. Nevertheless, the rapid human-to-human transmission among close contacts is an important feature in nCoV pneumonia.10,11,15\nThe patients admitted to the ICU were older and had a greater number of comorbid conditions than those not admitted to the ICU. This suggests that age and comorbidity may be risk factors for poor outcome. However, there was no difference in the proportion of men and women between ICU patients and non-ICU patients. These data differ from the recent report that showed 2019-nCoV infection is more likely to affect males.8 The possible explanation is that the nCoV infection in patients in the previous report was related to exposure associated with the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, and most of the affected patients were male workers. Compared with symptoms in non-ICU patients, symptoms were more common in critically ill patients, including dyspnea, abdominal pain, and anorexia. The onset of symptoms may help physicians identify the patients with poor prognosis. In this cohort, the overall rates of severe hypoxia and invasive ventilation were higher than those in the previous study,9 likely because the cases in the previous study were from the early epidemic stage of the NCIP, and the current cases are from the stage of outbreak.\nThe most common laboratory abnormalities observed in this study were depressed total lymphocytes, prolonged prothrombin time, and elevated lactate dehydrogenase. Compared with non-ICU patients, patients who received ICU care had numerous laboratory abnormalities. These abnormalities suggest that 2019-nCoV infection may be associated with cellular immune deficiency, coagulation activation, myocardia injury, hepatic injury, and kidney injury. These laboratory abnormalities are similar to those previously observed in patients with MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV infection.\nThe dynamic profile of laboratory findings was tracked in 33 patients with NCIP (5 nonsurvivors and 28 survivors). In the nonsurvivors, the neutrophil count, D-dimer, blood urea, and creatinine levels continued to increase, and the lymphocyte counts continued to decrease until death occurred. Neutrophilia may be related to cytokine storm induced by virus invasion, coagulation activation could have been related to sustained inflammatory response, and acute kidney injury could have been related to direct effects of the virus, hypoxia, and shock. The 3 pathologic mechanisms may be associated with the death of patients with NCIP.\nUntil now, no specific treatment has been recommended for coronavirus infection except for meticulous supportive care.17 Currently, the approach to this disease is to control the source of infection; use of personal protection precaution to reduce the risk of transmission; and early diagnosis, isolation, and supportive treatments for affected patients. Antibacterial agents are ineffective. In addition, no antiviral agents have been found to provide benefit for treating SARS and MERS. All of the patients in this study received antibacterial agents, 90% received antiviral therapy, and 45% received methylprednisolone. The dose of oseltamivir and methylprednisolone varied depending on disease severity. However, no effective outcomes were observed.\nThis study has several limitations. First, respiratory tract specimens were used to diagnose NCIP through RT-PCR. The serum of patients was not obtained to evaluate the viremia. The viral load is a potentially useful marker associated with disease severity of coronavirus infection, and this should be determined in NCIP. Second, hospital-related transmission/infection could not be definitively proven but was suspected and presumed based on timing and patterns of exposure to infected patients and subsequent development of infection. Third, among the 138 cases, most patients are still hospitalized at the time of manuscript submission. Therefore, it is difficult to assess risk factors for poor outcome, and continued observations of the natural history of the disease are needed.\nConclusions\nIn this single-center case series of 138 hospitalized patients with confirmed NCIP in Wuhan, China, presumed hospital-related transmission of 2019-nCoV was suspected in 41% of patients, 26% of patients received ICU care, and mortality was 4.3%.\nSection Editor: Derek C.

But one of his comments was especially prescient.\nElectron microscopy shows spikes adorning the coronavirus\u2019 outer surface, which gives the appearance of a corona surrounding the pathogen.\nAlissa Eckert/Dan Higgins/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\nHe warned of \u201cnew infectious diseases spread by respiratory route from person to person, such as the SARS [severe acute respiratory syndrome] or MERS [Middle East respiratory syndrome] viruses, which emerged as surprises and had case-fatality rates of 10% and 30%, respectively.\u201d Within weeks, reports of the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) surfaced in Wuhan, China.\nAs COVID-19 spread beyond China\u2019s borders, Inglesby spoke with JAMA about his work as director of the Center for Health Security at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. Founded in 1998, the center\u2019s objective is to protect the public from the consequences of epidemics, disasters, and other biological threats. The following is an edited version of that conversation.\nJAMA:How have biological threats changed or evolved over time?\nDr Inglesby:If you look back over the last 20 years, you see that there's been a staccato of very high profile infectious disease events which have required a lot of national action, science, and public health responses in pretty varied ways. Both from the deliberate side, with anthrax appearing in 2001 and potential government development or use of biological weapons, and on the natural side, with a series of events including SARS in 2009, H1N1, the big Ebola events, Zika, and MERS.\n\nThere's also the increasing power of biotechnology, which is almost entirely for the good in the sense of the creation of diagnostics, medicines, vaccines, and sequencing, but also has potential to be used in ways that could be malicious. Part of the problem is thinking about powerful technologies and what kinds of governance systems should be in place to either track them or provide oversight for them.\nJAMA:What are some of the drivers behind recent infectious disease outbreaks?\nDr Inglesby:In general, I think there are drivers of increasing emergence in infectious disease: The ability to have something travel easily from one part of the world to the other in a day or 2 and the enormous amount of air traffic; the proximity with which people are living with animals in high numbers; and the increasing encroachment of people onto previously pristine environments where only animals lived. There's also changes in climate, which are changing the areas where vectors are successful. Antibiotic resistance is another driver for changes in emerging infectious disease.\nJAMA:How does the novel coronavirus outbreak fit into this landscape?\nDr Inglesby:We've seen 2 large coronavirus problems emerge in the last 18 years. First was SARS, which caused problems very close to where the novel coronavirus seems to have emerged, and then we had MERS in the Middle East. Now we're seeing a new emergence of a coronavirus that's characteristics are not yet clear but does follow some of the similar patterns of these prior coronavirus jumps from animals to people.\n\nIt\u2019s worth thinking about coronaviruses as 2 bookends. On the one hand, we have coronaviruses which cause cold-like symptoms that are very mild in people. On the other extreme, SARS and MERS are quite serious illnesses with important case-fatality rates but they are not widely prevalent. This new coronavirus falls somewhere in the middle between those bookends. We know that in any new outbreak, we see the most serious cases first. It may be that we are seeing the very tip of the iceberg and the very serious cases, but that the base of the iceberg is a very large number of mild or asymptomatic illness. We'll know as we get more data where COVID-19 fits between the bookends of milder to more serious illness.\nJAMA:How are we doing from a domestic and global perspective in terms of a response?\nDr Inglesby:The WHO (World Health Organization) has people in China and is getting access to information as it's being developed. Journals have all agreed to share that information even before publication. Those are all good signs and are changes from past patterns. In the rest of the world, it's been valuable to see that people are being identified early after coming back from China and are self-reporting either in the airport as they travel back home or when they begin to feel sick after returning home. I think the systems in other parts of the world haven't really been tested beyond initial identification and isolation of small numbers of patients, so I think it's too soon to say how we're going to do globally. But at least initially, in terms of the efforts to identify people, they seem to be uncovering patients.\nJAMA:Is there anything different about the current response compared with prior outbreaks?\nDr Inglesby:One thing that is notable is that the genome for the virus from the first few patients was shared quickly in the world. Another thing that's happened, which is also different from past outbreaks, is this imposition of a very large-scale quarantine in Wuhan and in surrounding cities in China. We'll have to see what the consequences of that will be. I have some concerns that it is either already, or will, get in the way of doing the work that's going to be needed to find cases, get them diagnosed, get them isolated, and get them to a hospital. I worry that it may interfere with the ability to get medical supplies to the hospitals and doctors and nurses, but perhaps China has a way of doing those things, even in the setting of a quarantine, that will be effective. I hope that there's continual assessment about the impact of those quarantines.\nJAMA:What is the role of international regulatory bodies in promoting outbreak preparedness?\nDr Inglesby:We have the International Health Regulations (IHR), which are really vital. They require countries to have programs in place to do early disease detection and report it to the World Health Organization. The problem is that developing those capabilities within a country can be expensive and require expertise that not all countries may have. Only a minority of countries in the world are in compliance with their IHR obligations. There've been efforts made in the last 5, 6 years to inject more energy and money into that process through something called the Global Health Security Agenda, where a lot of donor countries have been working with partners that have less capability in this regard to help with finances or technical expertise.\nJAMA:What are deliberate biothreats?\nDr Inglesby:It encompasses the idea that some disgruntled scientist might do something with biology that would hurt someone else, all the way up to some government deciding to use biology to hurt or to create some kind of weapon. We know that on the national level those kinds of programs existed and were very serious in terms of funding and intention in the early part of the Cold War.\n\nBut in the '70s, we had the Biological Weapons Convention, which forbid all signatories from developing or making biological weapons. For the most part, that norm against biological weapons has held. But there really is no verification process that ensures that's the case. We don't really know, at least in the public domain, what all countries are doing. We know that terrorist groups have called for and attempted to make biological weapons without a lot of success, although they have made crude biological weapons in the past.\nJAMA:How important is research into deliberate biothreats?\nDr Inglesby:The research that's intended to lead to medicines, vaccines, diagnostics, and understanding pathogenesis of diseases that could be used as biological weapons is very important. After the anthrax events of 2001, there was a new program created by NIH (National Institutes of Health) to look at pathogenesis more deeply in a variety of infectious diseases. In addition, the US government created a whole strategy of developing new medical countermeasures. So it starts with basic science and, when the research is further along, transitions to an organization called BARDA (Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority), which has as its mission the advanced development of medical countermeasures for serious biological threats.\n\nI have concerns about research that has as its purpose the creation of lethal pathogens just to better understand them. Those kinds of efforts could inadvertently result in accidents or deliberate misapplication of the results in ways that are harmful. It\u2019s a careful balancing act, but I think those kinds of projects should undergo special review and a clear assessment of whether the benefit of that work is worth the risk.\nJAMA:How prepared are the US government and our public health infrastructure to respond to biological threats?\nDr Inglesby:I think that our overall system of response in the US is strong, and it has been the subject of a lot of work and funding over the years. If you look at the late '90s or early 2000s, we didn't have a lot of hospital preparedness for infectious disease emergencies. There were people who were committed to it, but they weren't getting any funding for it. There weren't systems for it. There wasn't a lot of technical advice from the government. You go back to 2001, there was no acquisition system for new medicines and vaccines for pandemics or biological threats. We now have NIH programs, BARDA programs, CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention), FDA (US Food and Drug Administration) programs, all oriented around trying to rapidly develop new medicines and vaccines when they're needed.\n\nWe also didn't have stockpiles of medicines. We didn't have state health programs that were focused on emergency response that we now do. So there's a lot that's been built.\nJAMA:What more needs to be done?\nDr Inglesby:We still have relatively few numbers of very high containment beds in the country. We have airborne isolation beds that take care of patients with TB (tuberculosis), but the training required to take care of a patient with Ebola is not the same as it is for TB. So there are still limits to what the system can do, despite the expertise, time, and money that's been spent on it. The initial funding that was given out to prepare a series of hospitals to take care of Ebola patients is about to expire, which is happening coincidentally at a time when we're about to have to deal with the coronavirus. So I think we need to keep that system going, or strengthen it, to be able to handle patients who are contagious.\n\nWe need to make sure that our supply lines for things like masks and gowns are stronger and less dependent on interruptions from overseas. We also have pretty sharp limits for certain products in terms of surge manufacturing. We may have a vaccine that's been created and proven to be effective, but we have limited ways to make large quantities of it. So we have to invest more in surge manufacturing of products, medicines, vaccines, and diagnostics.\n\nIt\u2019s a story of good movement over the last 20 years but with limits and with moments where political leaders seem to forget the importance of it. And then moments where commitments are reenergized, when people see how dependent we are on preparedness systems.\nJAMA:Is there anything that physicians and clinicians can do to prepare for biological risks in their communities?\nDr Inglesby:I think if possible, being familiar with unusual diseases. And the other thing would be to have knowledge and a relationship with the public health system wherever people are working. Many of these diseases need to be evaluated at a state health laboratory. Maybe it's as simple as knowing who in the hospital is responsible for that kind of thing. Those people should have a working relationship with state health departments so that the expertise and laboratory capacity of a state health department, or the CDC, can be brought in quickly when there's something that isn't right.", "jama.2020.0757": "H\numan coronaviruses (HCoVs) have long been considered inconsequential pathogens, causing the \u201ccommon cold\u201d in otherwise healthy people. However, in the 21st century, 2 highly pathogenic HCoVs\u2014severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV)\u2014emerged from animal reservoirs to cause global epidemics with alarming morbidity and mortality. In December 2019, yet another pathogenic HCoV, 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), was recognized in Wuhan, China, and has caused serious illness and death. The ultimate scope and effect of this outbreak is unclear at present as the situation is rapidly evolving.\nCoronaviruses are large, enveloped, positive-strand RNA viruses that can be divided into 4 genera: alpha, beta, delta, and gamma, of which alpha and beta CoVs are known to infect humans.1 Four HCoVs (HCoV 229E, NL63, OC43, and HKU1) are endemic globally and account for 10% to 30% of upper respiratory tract infections in adults. Coronaviruses are ecologically diverse with the greatest variety seen in bats, suggesting that they are the reservoirs for many of these viruses.2 Peridomestic mammals may serve as intermediate hosts, facilitating recombination and mutation events with expansion of genetic diversity. The surface spike (S) glycoprotein is critical for binding of host cell receptors and is believed to represent a key determinant of host range restriction.1\nUntil recently, HCoVs received relatively little attention due to their mild phenotypes in humans. This changed in 2002, when cases of severe atypical pneumonia were described in Guangdong Province, China, causing worldwide concern as disease spread via international travel to more than 2 dozen countries.2 The new disease became known as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), and a beta-HCoV, named SARS-CoV, was identified as the causative agent. Because early cases shared a history of human-animal contact at live game markets, zoonotic transmission of the virus was strongly suspected.3 Palm civets and raccoon dogs were initially thought to be the animal reservoir(s); however, as more viral sequence data became available, consensus emerged that bats were the natural hosts.\nCommon symptoms of SARS included fever, cough, dyspnea, and occasionally watery diarrhea.2 Of infected patients, 20% to 30% required mechanical ventilation and 10% died, with higher fatality rates in older patients and those with medical comorbidities. Human-to-human transmission was documented, mostly in health care settings. This nosocomial spread may be explained by basic virology: the predominant human receptor for the SARS S glycoprotein, human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), is found primarily in the lower respiratory tract, rather than in the upper airway. Receptor distribution may account for both the dearth of upper respiratory tract symptoms and the finding that peak viral shedding occurred late (\u224810 days) in illness when individuals were already hospitalized. SARS care often necessitated aerosol-generating procedures such as intubation, which also may have contributed to the prominent nosocomial spread.\nSeveral important transmission events did occur in the community, such as the well-characterized mini-outbreak in the Hotel Metropole in Hong Kong from where infected patrons traveled and spread SARS internationally. Another outbreak occurred at the Amoy Gardens housing complex where more than 300 residents were infected, providing evidence that airborne transmission of SARS-CoV can sometimes occur.4 Nearly 20 years later, the factors associated with transmission of SARS-CoV, ranging from self-limited animal-to-human transmission to human superspreader events, remain poorly understood.\nUltimately, classic public health measures brought the SARS pandemic to an end, but not before 8098 individuals were infected and 774 died.2 The pandemic cost the global economy an estimated $30 billion to $100 billion.1 SARS-CoV demonstrated that animal CoVs could jump the species barrier, thereby expanding perception of pandemic threats.\nIn 2012, another highly pathogenic beta-CoV made the species jump when Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) was recognized and MERS-CoV was identified in the sputum of a Saudi man who died from respiratory failure.3 Unlike SARS-CoV, which rapidly spread across the globe and was contained and eliminated in relatively short order, MERS has smoldered, characterized by sporadic zoonotic transmission and limited chains of human spread. MERS-CoV has not yet sustained community spread; instead, it has caused explosive nosocomial transmission events, in some cases linked to a single superspreader, which are devastating for health care systems. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), as of November 2019, MERS-CoV has caused a total of 2494 cases and 858 deaths, the majority in Saudi Arabia. The natural reservoir of MERS-CoV is presumed to be bats, yet human transmission events have primarily been attributed to an intermediate host, the dromedary camel.\nMERS shares many clinical features with SARS such as severe atypical pneumonia, yet key differences are evident. Patients with MERS have prominent gastrointestinal symptoms and often acute kidney failure, likely explained by the binding of the MERS-CoV S glycoprotein to dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), which is present in the lower airway as well as the gastrointestinal tract and kidney.3 MERS necessitates mechanical ventilation in 50% to 89% of patients and has a case fatality rate of 36%.2\nWhile MERS has not caused the international panic seen with SARS, the emergence of this second, highly pathogenic zoonotic HCoV illustrates the threat posed by this viral family. In 2017, the WHO placed SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV on its Priority Pathogen list, hoping to galvanize research and the development of countermeasures against CoVs.\nThe action of the WHO proved prescient. On December 31, 2019, Chinese authorities reported a cluster of pneumonia cases in Wuhan, China, most of which included patients who reported exposure to a large seafood market selling many species of live animals. Emergence of another pathogenic zoonotic HCoV was suspected, and by January 10, 2020, researchers from the Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center & School of Public Health and their collaborators released a full genomic sequence of 2019-nCoV to public databases, exemplifying prompt data sharing in outbreak response. Preliminary analyses indicate that 2019-nCoV has some amino acid homology to SARS-CoV and may be able to use ACE2 as a receptor. This has important implications for predicting pandemic potential moving forward. The situation with 2019-nCoV is evolving rapidly, with the case count currently growing into the hundreds. Human-to-human transmission of 2019-nCoV occurs, as evidenced by the infection of 15 health care practitioners in a Wuhan hospital. The extent, if any, to which such transmission might lead to a sustained epidemic remains an open and critical question. So far, it appears that the fatality rate of 2019-nCoV is lower than that of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV; however, the ultimate scope and effects of the outbreak remain to be seen.\nDrawing on experience from prior zoonotic CoV outbreaks, public health authorities have initiated preparedness and response activities. Wuhan leaders closed and disinfected the first identified market. The United States and several other countries have initiated entry screening of passengers from Wuhan at major ports of entry. Health practitioners in other Chinese cities, Thailand, Japan, and South Korea promptly identified travel-related cases, isolating individuals for further care. The first travel-related case in the United States occurred on January 21 in a young Chinese man who had visited Wuhan.\nAdditionally, biomedical researchers are initiating countermeasure development for 2019-nCoV using SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV as prototypes. For example, platform diagnostic modalities are being rapidly adapted to include 2019-nCoV, allowing early recognition and isolation of cases. Broad-spectrum antivirals, such as remdesivir, an RNA polymerase inhibitor, as well as lopinavir/ritonavir and interferon beta have shown promise against MERS-CoV in animal models and are being assessed for activity against 2019-nCoV.5 Vaccines, which have adapted approaches used for SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV, are also being pursued. For example, scientists at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Vaccine Research Center have used nucleic acid vaccine platform approaches.6 During SARS, researchers moved from obtaining the genomic sequence of SARS-CoV to a phase 1 clinical trial of a DNA vaccine in 20 months and have since compressed that timeline to 3.25 months for other viral diseases. For 2019-nCoV, they hope to move even faster, using messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccine technology. Other researchers are similarly poised to construct viral vectors and subunit vaccines.\nWhile the trajectory of this outbreak is impossible to predict, effective response requires prompt action from the standpoint of classic public health strategies to the timely development and implementation of effective countermeasures. The emergence of yet another outbreak of human disease caused by a pathogen from a viral family formerly thought to be relatively benign underscores the perpetual challenge of emerging infectious diseases and the importance of sustained preparedness.\nBack to top\nArticle Information\nCorresponding Author: Anthony S.

Mounting cases and deaths pose major public health and governance challenges. China\u2019s imposition of an unprecedented cordon sanitaire (a guarded area preventing anyone from leaving) in Hubei Province has also sparked controversy concerning its implementation and effectiveness. Cases have now spread to at least 4 continents. As of January 28, there are more than 4500 confirmed cases (98% in China) and more than 100 deaths.1 In this Viewpoint, we describe the current status of 2019-nCoV, assess the response, and offer proposals for strategies to bring the outbreak under control.\nCurrent Status\nChina rapidly isolated the novel coronavirus on January 7 and shared viral genome data with the international community 3 days later. Since that time, China has reported increasing numbers of cases and deaths, partly attributable to wider diagnostic testing as awareness of the outbreak grows. Health officials have identified evidence of transmission along a chain of 4 \u201cgenerations\u201d (a person who originally contracted the virus from a nonhuman source infected someone else, who infected another individual, who then infected another individual), suggesting sustained human-to-human transmission. Current estimates are that 2019-nCoV has an incubation period of 2 to 14 days, with potential asymptomatic transmission.1,2\nMultiple countries have confirmed travel-associated cases, including Australia, Cambodia, Canada, France, Germany, Japan, Nepal, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand, United Arab Emirates, United States, and Vietnam. Vietnam identified the first human-to-human transmission outside China. Yet fundamental knowledge gaps exist on how to accurately characterize the risk, including confirmation of the zoonotic source, efficiency of transmission, precise clinical symptoms, and the range of disease severity and case fatalities.\nControl Measures in China\nThe Chinese Lunar New Year is the largest annual mass travel event worldwide, risking amplification of the spread of 2019-nCoV. In response, China severely restricted movement across Hubei Province in 16 cities, affecting more than 50 million people.3 Authorities have closed public transit and canceled outbound transportation (air, train, and long-haul buses). Vehicular traffic in Wuhan was banned. China also imposed a ban on overseas travel with tour groups and suspended sale of flight and hotel packages. Authorities canceled Lunar New Year gatherings in Beijing as well as intraprovince bus service into the nation\u2019s capital. China's Finance Ministry announced \u00a51 billion (US $145 million) to fund the response as well as the rapid construction of 2 hospitals in Wuhan to treat those affected.\nThe Hong Kong Special Administrative Region declared its highest-tier emergency, curtailed public events, and barred travelers from Hubei Province. Travelers from mainland China must complete health declarations. Hong Kong has also closed schools and universities at least until mid-February.4\nControl Measures by Governments Worldwide\nAs travel-associated cases of 2019-nCoV escalate, countries have implemented border screening. China itself sharply curtailed travel to and from Hubei Province. Consequently, governments have not yet felt the need to ban travel from China, with 2 exceptions: North Korea has prohibited entry of all Chinese travelers and Kyrgyzstan has closed its border with China. During previous outbreaks like SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) and Ebola, governments curtailed travel and trade, so future directives seem reasonably foreseeable.\nMultiple countries (eg, Australia, Thailand, South Korea, Japan, India, Italy, Singapore, Malaysia, and Nigeria) have commenced temperature screening, symptom screening, and/or questionnaires for arriving passengers from China. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention launched enhanced, noninvasive screening of travelers from Wuhan at 20 major airports, while the US State Department issued its highest-level travel advisory for Hubei Province: level 4, \u201cdo not travel.\u201d The State Department now advises that people should \u201creconsider travel\u201d for all of mainland China.\nNonpharmaceutical Interventions\nThe sheer scale of China\u2019s cordon sanitaire across Hubei Province is unprecedented. Health authorities quarantined major cities during the 1918-1919 influenza pandemic, but with little lasting effect on the epidemic\u2019s spread.5 The Ebola epidemic in West Africa (2013-2016) spurred quarantines, such as the Liberian government\u2019s unsuccessful and heavily criticized cordon sanitaire of 60\u202f000 to 120\u202f000 people in West Point, Monrovia. The order led to violence and public mistrust that risked amplifying the spread of Ebola.\nGaining the public\u2019s trust is critical to any public health strategy. The health system should facilitate and encourage individuals to promptly seek testing and treatment, as well as to cooperate with containment measures such as isolation and contact investigations. According to Wuhan officials, by the time China implemented the cordon sanitaire, up to 5 million individuals had already traveled from Wuhan for Lunar New Year.6 While social distancing measures can delay viral spread, involuntary restrictions of movement within Hubei are likely to erode community trust and undermine cooperation with health authorities. Within the cordon sanitaire, logistical issues are evident, already resulting in shortages of pharmaceuticals and medical equipment. With hospitals and clinics overcrowded and public transport limited, symptomatic individuals may delay access to treatment. There is also the possibility that congregating people in congested cities may still lead to infection, albeit in divergent ways.\nBeyond the public health effects, enforcing cordons sanitaires can violate human rights, including the rights to dignity, privacy, and freedom of movement. The International Health Regulations (IHR) proscribe unnecessary interference with international travel and trade, while also requiring respect for the human rights of travelers. States must impose the \u201cleast restrictive\u201d measures necessary to safeguard public health.7 While border screening has had questionable efficacy for detecting cases in past disease outbreaks, the enhanced noninvasive screening implemented by US officials appears consistent with IHR requirements, provided it is conducted in a manner that treats travelers with respect for their dignity, human rights, and fundamental freedoms.7\nRole of the WHO\nThe IHR grants the WHO director-general power to declare a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC) for an extraordinary event that poses a public health risk to other states through international spread and requires a coordinated international response. It is clear that the 2019-nCoV outbreak fully meets these legal criteria for a PHEIC. The director-general announced that on January 30 the Emergency Committee will reconvene to consider if the coronavirus outbreak constitutes a global health emergency. The escalating 2019-nCoV outbreak poses a significant risk to human health, international spread, and interference with international traffic.\nWHO has declared 5 PHEICs: H1N1 (2009), polio (2014), Ebola in West Africa (2014), Zika (2016), and Ebola in the Democratic Republic of Congo (2019). The IHR does not grant WHO special powers or financing in the event of a PHEIC, suggesting an imperative to reform the regulations to give traction to an emergency declaration.8 Still, declaring a PHEIC is a powerful signal to the international community to launch a surge public health response, galvanizing political action and mobilizing funding. When declaring a PHEIC, the director-general can make influential, albeit legally nonbinding, recommendations. Declaring a health emergency would be a critical opportunity for WHO leadership to set norms, devise a global strategy, and uphold principles meticulously articulated by 196 states party to the IHR.\nBringing 2019-nCoV Under Control\nThe 2019-nCoV outbreak is currently not under control, with a high risk of spread in China and globally. Managing the outbreak requires international cooperation using traditional public health strategies that ultimately succeeded with SARS. The scientific community must fully characterize 2019-nCoV; epidemiologists must conduct intensive contact investigations; researchers should move rapidly toward development of medical countermeasures; and supply chains must mobilize to meet human needs for food, water, and medicine.\nWhile China has considerable resources and technical competence, containment of 2019-nCoV requires a coordinated international response. WHO should exercise leadership, urgently convening a multidisciplinary committee to devise a global action plan for novel outbreaks, including surveillance, contact investigations, testing, and treatment; fostering public trust and cooperation; transparently sharing scientific information; and incentivizing academia and industry to develop vaccines and antiviral medications.\nIt is too early to predict how widespread and pathogenic 2019-nCov will become. It is better to act decisively now rather than wait to see how the outbreak unfolds globally. Beyond all, this global health threat teaches, once again, that it is far better to invest in preparedness to prevent, rapidly identify, and contain outbreaks at their source. Reacting after a novel infection has spread widely (perhaps overreacting with travel bans and quarantines) costs lives, economic resources, and the well-being of millions of people currently cordoned off in a zone of contagion.\nBack to top\nArticle Information\nCorresponding Author: Lawrence O.

The FDA is \u201ckeenly aware\u201d that the outbreak will likely affect the medical product supply chain in the US, FDA Commissioner Stephen Hahn, MD, noted in a statement. He said the agency was proactively contacting drug and device makers to identify shortages rather than waiting for manufacturers to report such problems to the FDA.\n\u201cWe have been in contact with hundreds of manufacturers of human and animal drugs and medical devices, as well as syncing up with global regulators, like the European Medicines Agency, to assess and monitor for indications and early warning signs of potential manufacturing discontinuances or interruptions due to the outbreak,\u201d Hahn said.\n\u201cThe FDA will continue to closely monitor the domestic and global supply chain during this evolving situation,\u201d he said. He noted the agency is tracking reports of increased ordering through distributors of some essential medical devices, such as personal protective equipment.\nHahn said that although no FDA-licensed vaccines, gene therapies, or blood derivatives are manufactured in China, facilities there and in other locations in Southeast Asia supply raw materials used in pharmaceutical manufacturing. \u201cWe are in contact with biologics manufacturers to gauge any supply concerns regarding raw materials,\u201d he said.\nIf the FDA learns of a potential shortage of or disruption in the supply chain for medical products, the agency will take steps to limit the effect on patients and clinicians in the US, Hahn said, including \u201cclosely working with manufacturers and expediting review of alternate supply to prevent shortages, among other measures.\u201d\nThe FDA has also halted inspections of Chinese drug and device factories in response to the US State Department\u2019s warning against travel to China because of the COVID-19 epidemic. The agency typically conducts about 500 inspections annually in China, mostly of facilities that produce drugs, foods, and medical devices.\n\u201cAny travel to China which is deemed to be mission-critical is being assessed on a case-by-case basis in close coordination with [Health and Human Services] and the State Department,\u201d Hahn said. \u201cWe will revisit this approach and adjust as necessary as this outbreak continues to unfold.\u201d\nThe COVID-19 epidemic highlights existing concerns about the US\u2019s reliance on China and other countries as sources of active ingredients for pharmaceuticals. At an October 2019 hearing on safeguarding pharmaceutical supply chains in a global economy, Janet Woodcock, MD, director of the FDA\u2019s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, testified that the reliance on foreign suppliers \u201ccreates vulnerabilities in the US drug supply.\u201d", "jamahealthforum.2020.0114": "Events of the past week have made it clear that the novel coronavirus 2019-nCoV emergence in Wuhan, China, and its spread beyond that country\u2019s borders is a rapidly evolving situation in terms of the growing number of cases, the virus\u2019s continuing spread across the globe, and the responses of countries attempting to curb its spread. Here is a brief recap of some of the most recent developments of the epidemic as well as resources to consult for perspectives and updates.\nGlobal Health Emergency Declared\nOn Thursday, January 30, with reports of thousands of new cases of 2019-nCoV infection in China and evidence of person-to-person transmission in the United States and other countries, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the outbreak a global health emergency. At that point, there were 9826 confirmed cases globally, with 213 deaths. Of these, 9720 cases were in China; outside of China, health authorities reported 106 confirmed cases in 19 countries. As of Sunday, February 2, the WHO updated the count, reporting 14\u202f557 confirmed cases from 24 countries\u201414\u202f411 of them in China.\n\u201cWhile we still don\u2019t have the full picture and we can\u2019t predict how this situation will play out in the US, the current situation\u2026is a cause for concern,\u201d said Nancy Messonnier, MD, director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), at a press briefing on Friday. In addition to the rapid spread of the virus throughout China and in new locations outside of China, she called attention to the increasing number of reports of person-to-person transmission and evidence of asymptomatic spread.\nUS Public Health Emergency Declared, Quarantine Invoked\nAlso on Friday, US Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar declared that the 2019-nCoV outbreak constitutes a public health emergency in the United States and that international citizens who have traveled anywhere in China during the previous 14 days would be denied entry to the United States. In addition, any US citizen who had been in China\u2019s Hubei province during that period would be subject to quarantine for up to 14 days for medical observation.\nAt the CDC press briefing, Messonnier said that the agency, under statutory authority of the Health and Human Services secretary, had issued federal quarantine orders for all 195 repatriated individuals who were evacuated on January 29 from Wuhan, China, to a California military base. \u201cWhile we recognize this is an unprecedented action, we are facing an unprecedented public health threat,\u201d she said.\nThe action marks the first time in 50 years that the United States has issued a mandatory quarantine order. Isolation is a tool used to restrict the movement of people who are already sick with a specific illness, as opposed to quarantine, which restricts the movement of people who have been exposed to infection but are not yet sick. \u201cWhile there have been several isolation orders over the last many years, the last time the quarantine was used for a suspect case was in the 1960s for a smallpox evaluation,\u201d Marty Cetron, MD, director of CDC\u2019s Division of Global Migration and Quarantine, said at the briefing.\n2019-nCoV Coronavirus Resources\nWHO Global 2019-nCoV Coronavirus Case Updates\nThe WHO is issuing frequent situation reports with updates on cases, deaths, and countries, territories, or areas with reported confirmed 2019-nCoV cases.\n2019-nCoV Coronavirus Outbreak Map\nUsing artificial intelligence to analyze data from government reports, news sites, social media, and other sources, the public health surveillance site HealthMap provides near-real-time information tracking the spread of 2019-nCoV.\nCDC 2019-nCoV Coronavirus Information\nThe CDC\u2019s 2019 Novel Coronavirus site contains regularly updated information for the public, health care professionals, public health professionals, and laboratories.

It is critical to find new treatments.\nObjective  To determine whether convalescent plasma transfusion may be beneficial in the treatment of critically ill patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection.\nDesign, Setting, and Participants  Case series of 5 critically ill patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) who met the following criteria: severe pneumonia with rapid progression and continuously high viral load despite antiviral treatment; Pao2/Fio2 <300; and mechanical ventilation. All 5 were treated with convalescent plasma transfusion. The study was conducted at the infectious disease department, Shenzhen Third People's Hospital in Shenzhen, China, from January 20, 2020, to March 25, 2020; final date of follow-up was March 25, 2020. Clinical outcomes were compared before and after convalescent plasma transfusion.\nExposures  Patients received transfusion with convalescent plasma with a SARS-CoV-2\u2013specific antibody (IgG) binding titer greater than 1:1000 (end point dilution titer, by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay [ELISA]) and a neutralization titer greater than 40 (end point dilution titer) that had been obtained from 5 patients who recovered from COVID-19. Convalescent plasma was administered between 10 and 22 days after admission.\nMain Outcomes and Measures  Changes of body temperature, Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score (range 0-24, with higher scores indicating more severe illness), Pao2/Fio2, viral load, serum antibody titer, routine blood biochemical index, ARDS, and ventilatory and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) supports before and after convalescent plasma transfusion.\nResults  All 5 patients (age range, 36-65 years; 2 women) were receiving mechanical ventilation at the time of treatment and all had received antiviral agents and methylprednisolone. Following plasma transfusion, body temperature normalized within 3 days in 4 of 5 patients, the SOFA score decreased, and Pao2/Fio2 increased within 12 days (range, 172-276 before and 284-366 after). Viral loads also decreased and became negative within 12 days after the transfusion, and SARS-CoV-2\u2013specific ELISA and neutralizing antibody titers increased following the transfusion (range, 40-60 before and 80-320 on day 7). ARDS resolved in 4 patients at 12 days after transfusion, and 3 patients were weaned from mechanical ventilation within 2 weeks of treatment. Of the 5 patients, 3 have been discharged from the hospital (length of stay: 53, 51, and 55 days), and 2 are in stable condition at 37 days after transfusion.\nConclusions and Relevance  In this preliminary uncontrolled case series of 5 critically ill patients with COVID-19 and ARDS, administration of convalescent plasma containing neutralizing antibody was followed by improvement in their clinical status. The limited sample size and study design preclude a definitive statement about the potential effectiveness of this treatment, and these observations require evaluation in clinical trials.\nIntroduction\nThe epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) originating in Wuhan, China, has rapidly spread worldwide.1 As of March 24, 2020, China had reported 81\u202f767 cases with 3281 deaths, and the World Health Organization declared coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) a pandemic. As of March 18, 2020, cases were reported in approximately 195 countries.2\nNo specific therapeutic agents or vaccines for COVID-19 are available.3 Several therapies, such as remdesivir and favipiravir, are under investigation,3,4 but the antiviral efficacy of these drugs is not yet known. The use of convalescent plasma was recommended as an empirical treatment during outbreaks of Ebola virus in 2014, and a protocol for treatment of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus with convalescent plasma was established in 2015.5 This approach with other viral infections such as SARS-CoV, H5N1 avian influenza, and H1N1 influenza also suggested that transfusion of convalescent plasma was effective.6-10 In previous reports, most of the patients received the convalescent plasma by single transfusion.9-11 In a study involving patients with pandemic influenza A(H1N1) 2009 virus infection, treatment of severe infection with convalescent plasma (n\u2009=\u200920 patients) was associated with reduced respiratory tract viral load, serum cytokine response, and mortality.10 In another study involving 80 patients with SARS, administration of convalescent plasma was associated with a higher rate of hospital discharge at day 22 from symptom onset compared with patients who did not receive convalescent plasma.12 Accordingly, these findings raise the hypothesis that use of convalescent plasma transfusion could be beneficial in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2.\nThe purpose of this study was to describe the initial clinical experience with convalescent plasma transfusion administered to critically ill patients with COVID-19.\nMethods\nThis study was conducted at the infectious disease department, Shenzhen Third People's Hospital, Shenzhen, China, from January 20, 2020, to March 25, 2020, and the final date of follow-up was March 25, 2020. The study was approved by the ethics committees from Shenzhen Third People\u2019s Hospital, and each patient gave written informed consent.\nPatients\nPatients with laboratory confirmed COVID-19, diagnosed using quantitative reverse transcriptase\u2013polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) (GeneoDX Co, Ltd)13 were eligible to receive convalescent plasma treatment if they fulfilled the following criteria: (1) had severe pneumonia with rapid progression and continuously high viral load despite antiviral treatment; (2) Pao2/Fio2 of <300 (Pao2 measured in mm Hg and Fio2 measured as fraction of inspired oxygen)14; and (3) were currently or had been supported with mechanical ventilation. The serum of each recipient was obtained and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and neutralizing antibody titers were tested one day prior to the convalescent plasma transfusion. The ABO blood types of the patients were determined for potential compatibility with the convalescent plasma donor, and each received 2 consecutive transfusions of 200 to 250 mL of ABO-compatible convalescent plasma (400 mL of convalescent plasma in total) on the same day it was obtained from the donor. The patients received antiviral agents continuously until the SARS-CoV-2 viral loads became negative.\nDisease Severity Classification\nPatients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 infection who had any of the following were considered in critical condition: (1) respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation, (2) shock, identified by the use of vasopressor therapy and elevated lactate levels (>2 mmol/L) despite adequate fluid resuscitation, or (3) failure of other organs requiring admission to the intensive care unit (ICU).\nDonors\nThe 5 donors of convalescent plasma were between the ages of 18 and 60 years. The donors had recovered from SARS-CoV-2 infection and were invited to donate their convalescent plasma after written informed consent was obtained. All donors had been previously diagnosed with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 and subsequently tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory viruses, as well as for hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus, HIV, and syphilis at the time of blood donation. The donors had been well (asymptomatic) for at least 10 days, with a serum SARS-CoV-2\u2013specific ELISA antibody titer higher than 1:1000 and a neutralizing antibody titer greater than 40. Following donation, 400 mL of convalescent plasma was obtained from each donor by apheresis, and the plasma was immediately transfused to the recipients on the same day it was obtained.\nClinical Information\nClinical information for the 5 patients before and after convalescent plasma transfusion was obtained from a review of the hospital computer medical system and included the following: demographic data, days of admission from symptom onset, and presenting symptoms; data about various treatments, including mechanical ventilation, antiviral therapies, and steroids; clinical data, including body temperature, Pao2/Fio2, and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score (range 0-24, with higher scores indicating more severe illness); laboratory data, including white blood cell count, lymphocyte count, chemistry panels assessing liver and kidney function, cycle threshold value (Ct), inflammatory factors C-reactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin, and IL-6, and serum antibody titer (IgG, IgM, and neutralizing antibodies); data from chest imaging studies; and information on complications, such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), bacterial pneumonia, and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome.\nQuantitative RT-PCR\nThe qRT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 was assessed as described previously.13 Nasopharyngeal specimens collected during hospitalization were sent to the laboratory in a viral transport case. Total nucleic acid extraction from the samples was performed using the QIAamp RNA Viral Kit (Qiagen), and qRT-PCR was performed using a commercial kit specific for 2019-nCoV detection (GeneoDX Co) approved by the China Food and Drug Administration. Each RT-PCR assay provided a Ct value, which is the number of cycles required for the fluorescent signal to cross the threshold for a positive test: a higher Ct value is correlated with a lower viral load. The specimens were considered positive if the Ct value was 37.0 or lower and negative if the results were undetermined. Specimens with a Ct value higher than 37 were repeated. The specimen was considered positive if the repeated results were the same as the initial result and between 37 and 40. If the repeated Ct was undetectable, the specimen was considered negative. All procedures involving clinical specimens and SARS-CoV-2 were performed in a biosafety level 3 laboratory. The Ct values of the 5 recipients were obtained on day \u22121, day 1, day 3, day 7, and day 12 after the transfusion.\nELISA\nMicrotiter plates (Sangon Biotech) were coated overnight at 4 \u00b0C with 4 \u03bcg/mL recombinant SARS-CoV-2 RBD (receptor binding domain) proteins (50 \u03bcL per well) expressed by our laboratory through 293-T cells. The plates were washed 3 times with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 0.1% vol/vol Tween-20 (PBST) and blocked with blocking solution (PBS containing 2% wt/vol nonfat dry milk) for 2 hours at 37 \u00b0C. The plates were then washed with PBST. The serum samples were diluted to 200-fold into PBS as initial concentration, and serial 3-fold dilutions of serum was added to the wells and incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 60 minutes. After 3 washes, 100 \u03bcL of horseradish peroxidase\u2013conjugated goat anti\u2013human IgG (for IgG antibody titer detection) and IgM (for IgM antibody titer detection) antibodies solution (Sangon Biotech) were added to each plate, respectively, and incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 60 minutes. After 5 washes, 100 \u03bcL of tetramethylbenzidine substrate (Sangon Biotech) was added at room temperature in the dark. After 15 minutes, the reaction was stopped with a 2 M H2SO4 solution (sulfuric acid). The absorbance was measured at 450 nm. All samples were run in triplicate. The ELISA titers were determined by end point dilution.\nSerum Neutralization Assay\nVero cells (104) were seeded 24 hours before the infection in a 96-well plate (Costar). On the day of infection, the cells were washed twice. Serum samples from patients were incubated at 56 \u00b0C for 30 minutes and then diluted 2-fold in cell culture medium (modified eagle medium). Aliquots (40 \u03bcL) of diluted serum samples (from 2-fold to 2056-fold) were added to 50 \u03bcL of cell culture medium containing 50 times the tissue culture infective dose (TCID50) of the BetaCoV/Shenzhen/SZTH-003/2020 strain virus (isolated from this hospital, GISAID access number: EPI_ISL_406594)15 on a 96-well plate and incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 2 hours in CO2 5% vol/vol. Virus antibody mix was then added to cells in 96-well plates and plates were incubated at 37 \u00b0C with microscopic examination for cytopathic effect after a 5-day incubation. The highest dilution of serum that showed inhibition activity of SARS-CoV-2 was recorded as the neutralizing antibody titer. Assays were performed in triplicate with negative control samples from healthy volunteers.\nResults\nFive patients (age range, 36-73 years; 2 women) were treated with convalescent serum. None were smokers, and 4 of 5 had no preexisting medical conditions. All 5 had received various antiviral agents and steroids (Table 1). Convalescent plasma was administered between 10 and 22 days after admission.\nThe Ct value at the time of admission ranged from 18.9 to 38.0, and on the day of plasma transfusion from 22.0 to 35.9 (Table 2 and Figure 1A). It increased (improved) within 1 day after transfusion. The Ct value of patient 5 became negative on posttransfusion day 1, patient 3 and patient 4 became negative on day 3, and patient 1 and patient 2 became negative on day 12 after the transfusion (Table 2).\nThe SOFA score ranged from 2 to 10 prior to plasma transfusion, and decreased to a range of 1 to 4 at 12 days following transfusion (Table 2 and Figure 1B). The Pao2/Fio2 ranged from 172 to 276 prior to transfusion, and increased (improved) for 4 of 5 patients within 7 days after transfusion (overall range, 206-290), and increased substantially (range, 284-366) on the 12th day after the plasma treatment (Table 2 and Figure 1C). Body temperature ranged from 37.6 to 39.0 \u00b0C before plasma transfusion and declined to the normal range on the third day after the transfusion (Table 2 and Figure 1D).\nAfter the treatment, the values of the inflammatory biomarkers CRP, procalcitonin, and IL-6 of patients 1, 2, 4, and 5 decreased; the values of CRP and procalcitonin of patient 3 decreased (Table 2).\nThe computed tomography scans of the lungs of these patients all demonstrated severe pneumonia prior to plasma transfusion and showed improvement of the pulmonary lesion of patient 1 on the third day after the plasma transfusion (eFigure 1 in the Supplement) and gradual resolution of pulmonary lesions of other patients at 3 days after the plasma treatment (eFigures 2, 3, 4, and 5 in the Supplement).\nOne day prior to convalescent plasma administration, the RBD-specific IgG and IgM ELISA titers of the donors ranged between 1800 and 16\u202f200 (ELISA end point dilution titers) (Table 3). The neutralization titers against SARS-CoV-2 ranged between 80 and 480 (neutralizing end point dilution titers). The RBD-specific IgG ELISA titers of 5 recipients ranged between 1800 and 48\u202f600 and the IgM titers between 5400 and 145\u202f800 a day prior to the convalescent transfusion (eTable in the Supplement). After the transfusion of convalescent plasma, the titers of IgG and IgM in the sera of these patients increased in a time-dependent manner. The IgG titers of the treated patients increased to 145\u202f800, 5400, 5400, 145\u202f800 and 145\u202f800, and the IgM titers increased to 145\u202f800, 5400, 5400, 437\u202f400 and 145\u202f800, respectively, at 3 days after transfusion. These IgG and IgM titers maintained a high level at 7 days after transfusion (Figure 2A and 2B; eTable in the Supplement). The neutralizing antibody titers of the 5 recipients ranged between 40 and 160 before transfusion; one day after transfusion, the titers increased to 320, 80, 80, 160, and 240; on day 7, they were 320, 160, 160, 240, and 480, respectively (Figure 2C; eTable in the Supplement).\nAll 5 patients were receiving mechanical ventilation at the time of transfusion, and 3 patients (patients 3, 4, and 5) were weaned from mechanical ventilation (Table 2). Patient 2 was receiving ECMO at the time of plasma treatment but did not require ECMO on day 5 after transfusion (Table 2). Patients 3, 4, and 5 were discharged from the hospital (length of stay: 53, 51, and 55 days, respectively). As of March 25, 2020, patients 1 and 2 remained hospitalized, with lengths of stay of 37 days each.\nDiscussion\nIn this case series, 5 patients who were critically ill with COVID-19 were treated with convalescent plasma. As assessed by Ct, viral load declined within days of treatment with convalescent plasma, and the clinical conditions of these patients improved, as indicated by body temperature reduction, improved Pao2/Fio2, and chest imaging. Four patients who had been receiving mechanical ventilation and ECMO no longer required respiratory support by 9 days after plasma transfusion.\nPrevious studies have reported the use of convalescent plasma transfusion in the treatment of various infections.6,10,16 For example, patients (n\u2009=\u200950) with SARS had a significantly higher discharge rate by day 22 following onset of illness (73.4% vs 19.0%; P<.001) and lower case-fatality rate (0% vs 23.8%; P\u2009=\u2009.049) in the convalescent plasma treatment group (n\u2009=\u200919 patients) when compared with steroid treatment group (n\u2009=\u200921).17 In another study of 93 patients with influenza A(H1N1), patients who received convalescent plasma treatment (n\u2009=\u200920) compared with those in the control group (n\u2009=\u200973) had significantly fewer deaths (20% vs 54.8%; P\u2009=\u2009.01) and a lower median lymphocyte count on ICU admission.10\nIn this study, collection and transfusion of the plasma were done as previously reported.10 In addition, plasma was obtained from the donors and transfused in the recipients on the same day, which helps preserve the natural activity of the plasma.\nStudies have shown that viral loads are highly correlated with disease severity and progression.18 Fatal outcome of human influenza A(H5N1) has been associated with high viral load and hypercytokinemia.19 Apart from antiviral treatment, virus-specific neutralizing antibody, which could accelerate virus clearance and prevent entry into target cells, serves as the main mechanism for the restriction and clearance of the viruses by the host.20-22 In the current study, SARS-CoV-2 was still detectable in all 5 patents even though antiviral treatment had been given for at least 10 days, although viral load decreased and became undetectable soon after convalescent plasma treatment. As determined by ELISA, all plasma from the donors had high virus-specific IgG and IgM ELISA titers. Moreover, the neutralizing antibody titers, vital for the restriction of viral infection of the 5 recipients, significantly increased after plasma transfusion. The results highlight the possibility that antibodies from convalescent plasma may have contributed to the clearance of the virus and also the improvement of symptoms. In addition to viral neutralizing antibodies, acceleration of infected cell clearance by antibodies has also been found in an in vivo study of HIV-1 virus.23 In the current study, all patients received antiviral agents, including interferon and lopinavir/ritonavir, during and following convalescent plasma treatment, which also may have contributed to the viral clearance observed.\nLimitations\nThis study has several limitations. First, this was a small case series that included no controls. Second, it is unclear if these patients would have improved without transfusion of convalescent plasma, although the change in Ct and Pao2/Fio2 represent encouraging findings. Third, all patients were treated with multiple other agents (including antiviral medications), and it is not possible to determine whether the improvement observed could have been related to therapies other than convalescent plasma. Fourth, plasma transfusion was administered 10 to 22 days after admission; whether a different timing of administration would have been associated with different outcomes cannot be determined. Fifth, whether this approach would reduce case-fatality rates is unknown.\nConclusions\nIn this preliminary uncontrolled case series of 5 critically ill patients with COVID-19 and ARDS, administration of convalescent plasma containing neutralizing antibody was followed by improvement in the patients\u2019 clinical status. The limited sample size and study design preclude a definitive statement about the potential effectiveness of this treatment, and these observations require evaluation in clinical trials.\nBack to top\nArticle Information\nCorresponding Authors: Yingxia Liu, MD (yingxialiu@hotmail.com), Zheng Zhang, MD (zhangzheng1975@aliyun.com), and Lei Liu, MD (liulei3322@aliyun.com), Shenzhen Third People\u2019s Hospital, Second Hospital Affiliated to Southern University of Science and Technology, No. 29, Bulan Road, Longgang District, Shenzhen 518112, China.\nAccepted for Publication: March 20, 2020.\nPublished Online: March 27, 2020. doi:10.1001/jama.2020.4783\nAuthor Contributions: Dr L.

The study included all sequentially hospitalized patients between March 1, 2020, and April 4, 2020, inclusive of these dates.\nExposures  Confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection by positive result on polymerase chain reaction testing of a nasopharyngeal sample among patients requiring admission.\nMain Outcomes and Measures  Clinical outcomes during hospitalization, such as invasive mechanical ventilation, kidney replacement therapy, and death. Demographics, baseline comorbidities, presenting vital signs, and test results were also collected.\nResults  A total of 5700 patients were included (median age, 63 years [interquartile range {IQR}, 52-75; range, 0-107 years]; 39.7% female). The most common comorbidities were hypertension (3026; 56.6%), obesity (1737; 41.7%), and diabetes (1808; 33.8%). At triage, 30.7% of patients were febrile, 17.3% had a respiratory rate greater than 24 breaths/min, and 27.8% received supplemental oxygen. The rate of respiratory virus co-infection was 2.1%. Outcomes were assessed for 2634 patients who were discharged or had died at the study end point. During hospitalization, 373 patients (14.2%) (median age, 68 years [IQR, 56-78]; 33.5% female) were treated in the intensive care unit care, 320 (12.2%) received invasive mechanical ventilation, 81 (3.2%) were treated with kidney replacement therapy, and 553 (21%) died. As of April 4, 2020, for patients requiring mechanical ventilation (n\u2009=\u20091151, 20.2%), 38 (3.3%) were discharged alive, 282 (24.5%) died, and 831 (72.2%) remained in hospital. The median postdischarge follow-up time was 4.4 days (IQR, 2.2-9.3). A total of 45 patients (2.2%) were readmitted during the study period. The median time to readmission was 3 days (IQR, 1.0-4.5) for readmitted patients. Among the 3066 patients who remained hospitalized at the final study follow-up date (median age, 65 years [IQR, 54-75]), the median follow-up at time of censoring was 4.5 days (IQR, 2.4-8.1).\nConclusions and Relevance  This case series provides characteristics and early outcomes of sequentially hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19 in the New York City area.\nIntroduction\nThe first confirmed case of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in the US was reported from Washington State on January 31, 2020.1 Soon after, Washington and California reported outbreaks, and cases in the US have now exceeded total cases reported in both Italy and China.2 The rate of infections in New York, with its high population density, has exceeded every other state, and, as of April 20, 2020, it has more than 30% of all of the US cases.3\nLimited information has been available to describe the presenting characteristics and outcomes of US patients requiring hospitalization with this illness. In a retrospective cohort study from China, hospitalized patients were predominantly men with a median age of 56 years; 26% required intensive care unit (ICU) care, and there was a 28% mortality rate.4 However, there are significant differences between China and the US in population demographics,5 smoking rates,6 and prevalence of comorbidities.7\nThis study describes the demographics, baseline comorbidities, presenting clinical tests, and outcomes of the first sequentially hospitalized patients with COVID-19 from an academic health care system in New York.\nMethods\nThe study was conducted at hospitals in Northwell Health, the largest academic health system in New York, serving approximately 11 million persons in Long Island, Westchester County, and New York City. The Northwell Health institutional review board approved this case series as minimal-risk research using data collected for routine clinical practice and waived the requirement for informed consent. All consecutive patients who were sufficiently medically ill to require hospital admission with confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection by positive result on polymerase chain reaction testing of a nasopharyngeal sample were included. Patients were admitted to any of 12 Northwell Health acute care hospitals between March 1, 2020, and April 4, 2020, inclusive of those dates. Clinical outcomes were monitored until April 4, 2020, the final date of follow-up.\nData were collected from the enterprise electronic health record (Sunrise Clinical Manager; Allscripts) reporting database, and all analyses were performed using version 3.5.2 of the R programming language (R Project for Statistical Computing; R Foundation). Patients were considered to have confirmed infection if the initial test result was positive or if it was negative but repeat testing was positive. Repeat tests were performed on inpatients during hospitalization shortly after initial test results were available if there was a high clinical pretest probability of COVID-19 or if the initial negative test result had been judged likely to be a false-negative due to poor sample collection. Transfers from one in-system hospital to another were merged and considered as a single visit. There were no transfers into or out of the system. For patients with a readmission during the study period, data from the first admission are presented.\nData collected included patient demographic information, comorbidities, home medications, triage vitals, initial laboratory tests, initial electrocardiogram results, diagnoses during the hospital course, inpatient medications, treatments (including invasive mechanical ventilation and kidney replacement therapy), and outcomes (including length of stay, discharge, readmission, and mortality). Demographics, baseline comorbidities, and presenting clinical studies were available for all admitted patients. All clinical outcomes are presented for patients who completed their hospital course at study end (discharged alive or dead). Clinical outcomes available for those in hospital at the study end point are presented, including invasive mechanical ventilation, ICU care, kidney replacement therapy, and length of stay in hospital. Outcomes such as discharge disposition and readmission were not available for patients in hospital at study end because they had not completed their hospital course. Home medications were reported based on the admission medication reconciliation by the inpatient-accepting physician because this is the most reliable record of home medications. Final reconciliation has been delayed until discharge during the current pandemic. Home medications are therefore presented only for patients who have completed their hospital course to ensure accuracy.\nRace and ethnicity data were collected by self-report in prespecified fixed categories. These data were included as study variables to characterize admitted patients. Initial laboratory testing was defined as the first test results available, typically within 24 hours of admission. For initial laboratory testing and clinical studies for which not all patients had values, percentages of total patients with completed tests are shown. The Charlson Comorbidity Index predicts 10-year survival in patients with multiple comorbidities and was used as a measure of total comorbidity burden.8 The lowest score of 0 corresponds to a 98% estimated 10-year survival rate. Increasing age in decades older than age 50 years and comorbidities, including congestive heart disease and cancer, increase the total score and decrease the estimated 10-year survival. A total of 16 comorbidities are included. A score of 7 points and above corresponds to a 0% estimated 10-year survival rate. Acute kidney injury was identified as an increase in serum creatinine by 0.3 mg/dL or more (\u226526.5 \u03bcmol/L) within 48 hours or an increase in serum creatinine to 1.5 times or more baseline within the prior 7 days compared with the preceding 1 year of data in acute care medical records. This was based on the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) definition.9 Acute hepatic injury was defined as an elevation in aspartate aminotransferase or alanine aminotransferase of more than 15 times the upper limit of normal.\nResults\nA total of 5700 patients were included (median age, 63 years [interquartile range {IQR}, 52-75; range, 0-107 years]; 39.7% female) (Table 1). The median time to obtain polymerase chain reaction testing results was 15.4 hours (IQR, 7.8-24.3). The most common comorbidities were hypertension (3026, 56.6%), obesity (1737, 41.7%), and diabetes (1808, 33.8%). The median score on the Charlson Comorbidity Index was 4 points (IQR, 2-6), which corresponds to a 53% estimated 10-year survival and reflects a significant comorbidity burden for these patients. At triage, 1734 patients (30.7%) were febrile, 986 (17.3%) had a respiratory rate greater than 24 breaths/min, and 1584 (27.8%) received supplemental oxygen (Table 2 and Table 3). The first test for COVID-19 was positive in 5517 patients (96.8%), while 183 patients (3.2%) had a negative first test and positive repeat test. The rate of co-infection with another respiratory virus for those tested was 2.1% (42/1996). Discharge disposition by 10-year age intervals of all 5700 study patients is included in Table 4. Length of stay for those who died, were discharged alive, and remained in hospital are presented as well. Among the 3066 patients who remained hospitalized at the final study follow-up date (median age, 65 years [IQR 54-75]), the median follow-up at time of censoring was 4.5 days (IQR, 2.4-8.1). Mortality was 0% (0/20) for male and female patients younger than 20 years. Mortality rates were higher for male compared with female patients at every 10-year age interval older than 20 years.\nOutcomes for Patients Who Were Discharged or Died\nAmong the 2634 patients who were discharged or had died at the study end point, during hospitalization, 373 (14.2%) were treated in the ICU, 320 (12.2%) received invasive mechanical ventilation, 81 (3.2%) were treated with kidney replacement therapy, and 553 (21%) died (Table 5). As of April 4, 2020, for patients requiring mechanical ventilation (n = 1151, 20.2%), 38 (3.3%) were discharged alive, 282 (24.5%) died, and 831 (72.2%) remained in hospital. Mortality rates for those who received mechanical ventilation in the 18-to-65 and older-than-65 age groups were 76.4% and 97.2%, respectively. Mortality rates for those in the 18-to-65 and older-than-65 age groups who did not receive mechanical ventilation were 19.8% and 26.6%, respectively. There were no deaths in the younger-than-18 age group. The overall length of stay was 4.1 days (IQR, 2.3-6.8). The median postdischarge follow-up time was 4.4 days (IQR, 2.2-9.3). A total of 45 patients (2.2%) were readmitted during the study period. The median time to readmission was 3 days (IQR, 1.0-4.5). Of the patients who were discharged or had died at the study end point, 436 (16.6%) were younger than age 50 with a score of 0 on the Charlson Comorbidity Index, of whom 9 died.\nOutcomes by Age and Risk Factors\nFor both patients discharged alive and those who died, the percentage of patients who were treated in the ICU or received invasive mechanical ventilation was increased for the 18-to-65 age group compared with the older-than-65 years age group (Table 5). For patients discharged alive, the lowest absolute lymphocyte count during hospital course was lower for progressively older age groups. For patients discharged alive, the readmission rates and the percentage of patients discharged to a facility (such as a nursing home or rehabilitation), as opposed to home, increased for progressively older age groups.\nOf the patients who died, those with diabetes were more likely to have received invasive mechanical ventilation or care in the ICU compared with those who did not have diabetes (eTable 1 in the Supplement). Of the patients who died, those with hypertension were less likely to have received invasive mechanical ventilation or care in the ICU compared with those without hypertension. The percentage of patients who developed acute kidney injury was increased in the subgroups with diabetes compared with subgroups without those conditions.\nAngiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitor and Angiotensin II Receptor Blocker Use\nHome medication reconciliation information was available for 2411 (92%) of the 2634 patients who were discharged or who died by the study end. Of these 2411 patients, 189 (7.8%) were taking an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi) at home and 267 (11.1%) were taking an angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) at home. The median number of total home medications was 3 (IQR, 0-7). Outcomes for subgroups of patients with hypertension by use of ACEi or ARB home medication are shown in eTable 2 in the Supplement. Numbers provided for total patients taking ACEi or ARB therapy in eTable 2 in the Supplement are provided only for patients who also had a diagnosis of hypertension.\nOf the patients taking an ACEi at home, 91 (48.1%) continued taking an ACEi while in the hospital and the remainder discontinued this type of medication during their hospital visit. Of the patients taking an ARB at home, 136 (50.1%) continued taking an ARB while in the hospital and the remainder discontinued taking this type of medication during their hospital visit. Of patients who were not prescribed an ACEi or ARB at home, 49 started treatment with an ACEi and 58 started treatment with an ARB during their hospitalization. Mortality rates for patients with hypertension not taking an ACEi or ARB, taking an ACEi, and taking an ARB were 26.7%, 32.7%, and 30.6%, respectively.\nDiscussion\nTo our knowledge, this study represents the first large case series of sequentially hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19 in the US. Older persons, men, and those with pre-existing hypertension and/or diabetes were highly prevalent in this case series and the pattern was similar to data reported from China.4 However, mortality rates in this case series were significantly lower, possibly due to differences in thresholds for hospitalization. This study reported mortality rates only for patients with definite outcomes (discharge or death), and longer-term study may find different mortality rates as different segments of the population are infected. The findings of high mortality rates among ventilated patients are similar to smaller case series reports of critically ill patients in the US.10\nACEi and ARB medications can significantly increase mRNA expression of cardiac angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2),11 leading to speculation about the possible adverse, protective, or biphasic effects of treatment with these medications.12 This is an important concern because these medications are the most prevalent antihypertensive medications among all drug classes.13 However, this case series design cannot address the complexity of this question, and the results are unadjusted for known confounders, including age, sex, race, ethnicity, socioeconomic status indicators, and comorbidities such as diabetes, chronic kidney disease, and heart failure.\nMortality rates are calculated only for patients who were discharged alive or died by the study end point. This biases our rates toward including more patients who died early in their hospital course. Most patients in this study were still in hospital at the study end point (3066, 53.8%). We expect that as these patients complete their hospital course, reported mortality rates will decline.\nLimitations\nThis study has several limitations. First, the study population only included patients within the New York metropolitan area. Second, the data were collected from the electronic health record database. This precluded the level of detail possible with a manual medical record review. Third, the median postdischarge follow-up time was relatively brief at 4.4 days (IQR, 2.2-9.3). Fourth, subgroup descriptive statistics were unadjusted for potential confounders. Fifth, clinical outcome data were available for only 46.2% of admitted patients. The absence of data on patients who remained hospitalized at the final study date may have biased the findings, including the high mortality rate of patients who received mechanical ventilation older than age 65 years.\nConclusions\nThis case series provides characteristics and early outcomes of sequentially hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19 in the New York City area.\nBack to top\nArticle Information\nCorresponding Author: Karina W.

Physicians and health care workers are at added risk of exposure and infection during the course of patient care. Because of the rapid spread of this disease through respiratory droplets, health care workers who come in close contact with the upper aerodigestive tract during diagnostic and therapeutic procedures, such as otolaryngologists\u2013head and neck surgeons, are particularly at risk. A set of safety recommendations was created based on a review of the literature and communications with physicians with firsthand knowledge of safety procedures during the COVID-19 pandemic.\nObservations  A high number of health care workers were infected during the first phase of the pandemic in the city of Wuhan, China. Subsequently, by adopting strict safety precautions, other regions were able to achieve high levels of safety for health care workers without jeopardizing the care of patients. The most common procedures related to the examination and treatment of upper aerodigestive tract diseases were reviewed. Each category was reviewed based on the potential risk imposed to health care workers. Specific recommendations were made based on the literature, when available, or consensus best practices. Specific safety recommendations were made for performing tracheostomy in patients with COVID-19.\nConclusions and Relevance  Preserving a highly skilled health care workforce is a top priority for any community and health care system. Based on the experience of health care systems in Asia and Europe, by following strict safety guidelines, the risk of exposure and infection of health care workers could be greatly reduced while providing high levels of care. The provided recommendations, which may evolve over time, could be used as broad guidance for all health care workers who are involved in the care of patients with COVID-19.\nIntroduction\nThe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has put unprecedented challenges on the medical community. Physicians and other health care workers who perform and participate in examinations and procedures within the head and neck region and airway are at particularly high risk of exposure and infection from aerosol and droplet contamination. Specific data on the risk of infection in otolaryngologists\u2013head and neck surgeons are not available. However, one of the earliest reports from Wuhan, China, where severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was first identified, found 40 health care workers among the first consecutive 138 patients hospitalized.1 During the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak of 2003 in Canada, 51% of the 438 cases were health care workers, and 3 died from SARS-related causes.2 While the figures are worrying, other data suggest that through the use of careful hygiene, health care workers can stay safe. A case report of early COVID-19 experience from Singapore3 revealed that none of the 41 health care workers who took care of a patient with severe pneumonia before their diagnosis of COVID-19 became infected themselves or developed symptoms. These health care workers had been present during intubation and extubation of the patient; they were present for at least 10 minutes at a distance of less than 2 m from the patient, with 85% wearing a surgical mask and the remainder wearing N95 masks.\nThe preservation of this highly skilled, limited workforce should be a top priority of health care officials and policy makers. At the time of this writing, to our knowledge, no unified, widely agreed-on protocols exist on how to perform a routine examination of the head and neck; office-based rigid and flexible endoscopy of the nose, sinuses, and larynx; tracheostomy; and other common operations. Some health authorities and societies have developed separate guidelines.4\nThis article was prepared in consultation with otolaryngologists\u2013head and neck surgeons and other health care workers in the US, Asia, and Europe, applying existing guidance from the infection control specialty to physicians potentially at risk from exposure to the head and neck of infected patients. As the available information evolves, we expect to modify these guidelines. We expect that each health authority or organization will make specific decisions appropriate to their community. These recommendations have been developed to give broad guidance to practitioners. Per the US Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, the following factors should be considered when determining whether a planned examination or surgical procedure should proceed: current and projected COVID-19 cases in the facility and region; supply of personal protective equipment (PPE), beds, ventilators, and staff in the facility and system; health and age of the patients, especially given the risks of SARS-CoV-2 infection during recovery; and urgency of the procedure.5 Here, we highlight common procedures that should be considered and provide a framework on which to base decisions using the best available evidence. As this is a highly fluid situation, it is likely that these recommendations will change based on emerging evidence, the infection burden, availability of the health care workforce, and medical infrastructure.\nGeneral Considerations\nGeneral Care of Otolaryngologic Patients\nHead and neck examinations are considered high risk in patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19; therefore, we recommend the following guidelines. Depending on the current circumstances of the local setting, such as the rate of community spread and case doubling time, routine, nonurgent appointments should be postponed to limit the chance of SARS-CoV-2 infection of patients or health care workers during their visit to the facility. This may include postponing appointments for patients with benign disease (eg, benign salivary or thyroid tumors, hyperparathyroidism) or patients undergoing routine surveillance visits after treatment for head and neck cancer. In all instances, patients should be queried by telephone about any new or concerning signs or symptoms that may suggest disease recurrence and/or pending issues, such as severe dysphagia or airway compromise, as well as current symptoms suggestive of COVID-19. Patients thought to be at risk for significant negative outcomes without evaluation should be offered an in-person clinic visit. Those with symptoms suggesting possible COVID-19 should be directed to the appropriate self-care or triage mechanism. The use of telephone, video, or telemedicine visits should be considered to maintain relationships with patients and to support assessments that can be made without an in-person physical examination. Only patients who need a thorough head and neck examination should be seen in person.\nUse of Powered Air-Purifying Respirators vs N95 Masks\nIn the literature, conflicting practices can be seen regarding the use of N95 masks and tight-fitting goggles or the use of powered air-purifying respirators (PAPRs).6,7 PAPRs reduce the risk of exposure more than N95 masks, but how much more they reduce the risk depends on the airflow setting. The assigned protection factor range is 25 to 1000 for PAPRs and 10 for N95 masks.8 The most common concern about using PAPRs is their effect on the sterile field during surgery, as they do not filter the discharged air, but there are few data on the infection risk compared with other methods or in combination with the use of a mask. Nearly as important, they are also cumbersome to use. They can limit visibility if they fog up, make using a headlight impossible, and, if the hooded type is used, render the use of a stethoscope impossible. Donning and doffing are opportunities for self-exposure. However, ill-fitting N95 masks also increase the risk of exposure and thus carry their own disadvantages. Decisions about which protection to use may depend on the settings, risks, and logistics.9 Practicing the planned tasks in the use of PAPRs if they are to be used is important.\nThe Otolaryngology\u2013Head and Neck Physical Examination and Associated Procedures\nGeneral Examination\nHead and neck examination that will include the mucous membranes should be performed by maintaining the suggested level of precaution (Table). The examination preferably should be performed in a separate room away from other patients, and only the necessary personnel should be present. The examination should be performed by the most experienced person present and might be a more focused assessment, based on the judgment of the examining physician. Proper doffing and disposal of PPE are of utmost importance.\nEndoscopic Examinations of the Mucosa of the Head and Neck\nEndoscopic examinations of the nose, sinuses, oropharynx, hypopharynx, and larynx are among the most common head and neck diagnostic procedures and are routinely performed by a wide variety of practitioners and trainees. They are considered aerosol-generating procedures.10 Moreover, the nose and nasopharynx have been shown to be reservoirs for high concentrations of the SARS-CoV-2 virus,11 and after manipulation, viral particles have been shown to be airborne for 3 hours or more.12 Therefore, we recommend the same precautions be adopted for mucosal surface endoscopic examinations of the head and neck as for other aerosol-generating procedures.\nExaminations should be limited to patients who have a clear indication and need. Again, the examination should be performed by the most experienced personnel available in an expedient fashion. Routine or lower-priority examinations should be deferred during the pandemic. Patients should be placed in private rooms with negative pressure, if available, and the use of PPE should follow the guidance of the Table.\nSpecific recommendations additionally include the following:\nIn awake patients, adequate topical preparation to make the examination more comfortable is important. However, use of sprays should be avoided. Carefully placed pledgets should be used to provide decongestion and anesthesia.\nTopical anesthesia for any office-based intervention of the larynx under the guidance of a laryngoscope or strobolaryngoscope is performed through application of a spray. This is considered high risk; therefore, office-based biopsy, injection, laser, or other procedures should be delayed if possible.\nIf a video screen is available to project the examination, it should be used to keep the patient\u2019s and health care worker\u2019s faces apart.\nDisposable endoscopes may be considered.\nAfter completion of the examination, the endoscope must be appropriately handled. The endoscope should not be removed from the examination room without a protective cover.\nCommonly Performed Otolaryngology Procedures\nProcedures Commonly Performed Outside the Operating Room\nThese inpatient, emergency department, and outpatient otolaryngology procedures should be handled differently during the pandemic. Adequate education of health care workers is essential. The following are examples of procedures that in this setting are considered high risk:\nRoutine suctioning of patients with a tracheotomy.\nNasal packing placement, removal, or manipulation.\nDrainage of peritonsillar abscesses. Consider avoiding through the use of antibiotic management or needle drainage instead of open drainage.\nAttempted foreign body removal. Deferring may not be possible. If the location is such that it will be particularly challenging to access in an awake patient or if the individual is particularly intolerant of manipulation, performing the removal under general anesthesia may be necessary.\nOperative Procedures\u2014General Considerations\nA number of head and neck, otolaryngologic, and oral surgery procedures are high risk owing to exposure of airway and mucosal surfaces and the possibility of generating aerosols. During the pandemic, based on the guidelines of national and state authorities, all elective procedures that can be safely postponed should be delayed. If an operative procedure involving the mucosa of the head and neck is planned, the following considerations are recommended.\nCOVID-19 Status\nIf possible, determine the COVID-19 status of the patient beforehand. If a patient tests positive, a careful assessment of risk to the patient and health care workers should be performed by a multidisciplinary team before the operation is recommended. Operating on mucosal surfaces in a patient who is actively infected generates a great risk for the entire operating room and recovery units and may compromise the patient\u2019s ability to recover from the infection.\nOperating Room Setting\nHigh-risk operations or operations in patients with known COVID-19 should be performed in a designated operating room with negative pressures.13 Unprotected health care personnel should not be allowed in a room where an aerosol-generating procedure is being or has been conducted. If a patient is known or suspected to have COVID-19, appropriate PPE must be worn by all.\nHigh-Risk Procedures\nConsidering the high viral titers in nasal mucosal, oral, pharyngeal, and pulmonary secretions, any operation that involves these surfaces is high risk to the entire operating room personnel. To our knowledge, bloodborne transmission has not been documented, but aerosolization of blood through the use of energy devices used for control of bleeding and in dissection has been documented.14 These procedures should be considered higher risk. This includes the use of powered devices (eg, drills, microdebriders, saws) or ultrasonic shears, such as the Harmonic scalpel (Ethicon) or Thunderbeat scalpel (Olympus).\nIf a high-risk operation is indicated during the pandemic in a SARS-CoV-2\u2013negative patient or a patient without symptoms or contact, appropriate PPE for all operating room staff is strongly recommended. Observed levels of community disease will not reflect the full prevalence.\nIntubation and Extubation\nIn all operations, coordination with the anesthesia team is critical. It is advisable that during intubation, all nonessential staff leave the room and only return after the airway is secured. Additionally, all nonessential staff should be out of the room during extubation. Anybody who is present should maintain appropriate PPE. In some centers, an interval equivalent to known air exchange times for that operating room is practiced before other personnel are allowed to enter. Jet ventilation procedures pose a particularly high risk and should be performed only under absolute necessity and with appropriate PPE, preferably in a negative-pressure room.\nPatient Transport\nAdequate protection during the transfer of SARS-CoV-2\u2013positive patients or patients of unknown infection status after a high-risk procedure is critical. Clear protocols should be established with the nursing staff, recovery unit personnel, anesthesia department, and infection control personnel. Nonintubated patients could be transferred while wearing a surgical mask (not an N95 mask) if tolerated. If oxygen is required, it can be administered by face mask over the surgical mask. Intubated patients should be transported with an intensive care unit ventilator (dry circuit, filter in place) and not with a bag-valve mask, which breaks the closed circuit. Appropriate PPE should be maintained by all health care workers participating in the transfer.\nOperative Procedures\u2014Specific Procedures and Scenarios\nEndoscopic Sinonasal and Skull Base Surgery\nEndoscopic nasal operations, including sinus surgery and transsphenoidal pituitary surgery, are very high-risk procedures. In general, these procedures should be postponed in patients with COVID-19 or those who cannot be tested. In negative patients, PPE for all operating room staff is recommended as per the Table.15\nThyroidectomy and Neck Procedures\nProcedures that do not expose mucosal surfaces are lower risk, with the caveat that the use of energy devices can result in aerosolization of the virus from the bloodstream or other gastrointestinal secretions. Patients with COVID-19 are likely to have the virus in their bloodstream and feces, based on the experience with SARS, which is also caused by a coronavirus.16,17\nEar Surgery\nIt is not known if the respiratory mucosa lining the middle ear and mastoid air cell system is involved in COVID-19. But because the rest of the airway is involved, it appears likely that the lining of the eustachian tube, middle ear, and mastoid air cell system are all contaminated.18,19 Drilling through the mastoid creates droplets and aerosols in significant clouds that, if the virus is present, could risk infecting everyone in the operating room environment. As contaminated mists harbor viable virus for several hours, especially in enclosed spaces, caution is warranted. Mastoidectomy therefore is considered a high-risk procedure. Ideally, any patient undergoing any ear surgery should be tested for COVID-19 preoperatively. If a patient is positive, surgery should be delayed until the patient has cleared the disease.\nManagement of Facial Trauma\nManagement of trauma patients should be led by the trauma management team. Physicians who are called to assess trauma patients or perform specific procedures in areas of high community spread should be equipped with adequate PPE based on the trauma center policies. After following the trauma triage protocol, if assessment and treatment of facial trauma is needed, our recommendation is to treat patients of unknown COVID-19 status as COVID-19 positive. Lacerations that involve mucosal surfaces should be treated as high risk. For injuries that require operative intervention (for example, reduction of fractures), the infection status of the patient should be confirmed first and then definitive treatment initiated if at all possible. In areas with significant shortage of medical capacity and personnel, nonoperative approaches should be considered as much as medically acceptable.\nTracheostomy\nPerforming tracheostomy on patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 imposes unique challenges on not only otolaryngologists\u2013head and neck surgeons but the entire health care team.20 In nonemergency situations, all cases should be reviewed by a multidisciplinary team, and the risks vs benefits of the procedure for the patient and the entire health care team should be carefully assessed. Additionally, a detailed postprocedure care plan should be established to ascertain the protection of other patients and health care workers. The accompanying article by Tay et al6 outlines many of these considerations. In general, most tracheostomy procedures should be avoided or delayed (even beyond 14 days) because of the high infectious risks of the procedure and subsequent care until such time as the acute phase of infection has passed, when the likelihood of recovery is high, and when ventilator weaning has become the primary goal of care. Avoiding early tracheostomy in patients with COVID-19 is suggested because of the higher viral load that may be present at this time. In addition, early tracheostomy was not found to be associated with improved mortality or reduced length of intensive care unit stay in a randomized clinical trial of patients on mechanical ventilation.21\nWe suggest the following additional guidelines:\nSelect the patients carefully. If the tracheostomy is assessed as difficult because of anatomy, history, comorbidities, or other factors, consider postponing the procedure.\nConsideration may be given to percutaneous dilatational tracheostomy if the patient\u2019s anatomy and proceduralist expertise allow it to be done safely with minimal or no bronchoscopy, endotracheal suctioning, and disruption of the ventilator circuit.\nProvide adequate sedation including paralysis to eliminate the risk of coughing during the procedure. Ventilation should be paused (apnea) at end-expiration when the trachea is entered and any time the ventilation circuit is disconnected.\nChoose a nonfenestrated, cuffed, tracheostomy tube on the smaller side to make the tracheostomy hole smaller overall (Shiley size 6 for both men and women is adequate). Keep the cuff inflated to limit the spread of virus through the upper airway.\nPerform tracheostomy suctioning using a closed suction system with a viral filter.\nUse a heat moisture exchanger device instead of tracheostomy collar during weaning to prevent virus spread or reinfection of patients.\nAvoid changing the tracheostomy tube until viral load is as low as possible.\nConclusions\nWe acknowledge that these challenging times require extraordinary efforts. Maintaining the health and strength of our clinical workforce is critical to avoiding collapse of our health care system. However, the experience of our colleagues in Singapore and Hong Kong in protecting their health care workers is quite reassuring.22 By following carefully planned routines and procedures, we will be able to provide excellent care and help protect the safety and health of our colleagues.\nBack to top\nArticle Information\nAccepted for Publication: March 24, 2020.\nCorresponding Author: Babak Givi, MD, Department of Otolaryngology\u2013Head and Neck Surgery, NYU Langone Health, 160 E 34th St, 7th Floor, New York, NY 10016 (babak.givi@nyulangone.org).\nPublished Online: March 31, 2020. doi:10.1001/jamaoto.2020.0780\nConflict of Interest Disclosures: Dr Morris reported receiving grants from Illumina, Inc. and AstraZeneca outside the submitted work.

The techniques were used successfully, and no adverse events occurred.\nMeaning  Modified microlaryngoscopy and bronchoscopy techniques were associated with satisfactory patient outcomes and theoretically are associated with reduced risk to the otolaryngology theater team during the COVID-19 pandemic.\nAbstract\nImportance  As an aerosol-generating procedure, traditional pediatric microlaryngoscopy and bronchoscopy techniques must be adapted in order to reduce the risk of transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2.\nObjective  To describe a modified technique for pediatric microlaryngoscopy and bronchoscopy for use in the COVID-19 era and present a case series of patients for whom the technique has been used.\nDesign, Setting, and Participants  Observational case series of pediatric patients undergoing emergency or urgent airway procedures performed at a tertiary pediatric otolaryngology department in Australia. Procedures were completed between March 23 and April 9, 2020, with a median (range) follow-up of 24.5 (11-28) days.\nExposures  Modified technique for microlaryngoscopy and bronchoscopy, minimizing aerosolization of respiratory tract secretions.\nMain Outcomes and Measures  The main outcome was the feasibility of technique, which was measured by ability to perform microlaryngoscopy and bronchoscopy with comparable success to the usual technique (ie, adequate examination of the patient for diagnostic procedures and ability to perform interventional procedures).\nResults  The technique was used successfully in 8 patients (median [range] age, 160 days [27 days to 2 years 6 months]); 5 patients were male, and 3 were female.

No adverse events occurred.\nConclusions and Relevance  In this case series, feasibility of a modified technique for pediatric microlaryngoscopy and bronchoscopy was demonstrated. By reconsidering the surgical approach in light of specific COVID-19 infection risks, this technique may be associated with reduced spread of aerosolized respiratory secretions perioperatively and intraoperatively, but the technique and patient outcomes require further study.\nIntroduction\nThe current COVID-19 pandemic, caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), presents significant challenges to the surgical community worldwide and the otolaryngology community in particular. The major transmission route of COVID-19 occurs through the upper respiratory tract, with high levels of virus shedding occurring in the nasal cavity.1,2 COVID-19 is typically spread by droplets, but aerosol-generating procedures (AGPs) are thought to aerosolize the virus and increase the chance of viral spread.3,4 In the international otolaryngology community, surgeons are considered to be at high risk of COVID-19 infection owing to routine inspection of the upper respiratory tract and the need to perform AGPs at both the patient bedside and in the operating theater.5,6\nIn Western Australia, community transmission of COVID-19 is currently at low levels.7 There has been the opportunity to devise and refine treatment algorithms for AGPs. Worldwide, otolaryngologists have been collaborating through traditional channels, such as scientific journals; modern channels, such as webinars; and informally through applications, such as WhatsApp.\nAll urgent pediatric airway procedures are currently managed at a single tertiary pediatric hospital. Procedures involving the upper aerodigestive tract are considered high risk for COVID-19 transmission.8 It is important to reduce the aerosolization of respiratory secretions during airway management, and changes to our routine pediatric airway algorithm have been made with this aim.9 The current technique used for diagnostic and therapeutic microlaryngoscopy and bronchoscopy (MLB) in the operating theater in patients with unknown or positive COVID-19 status will be described. In keeping with the approach of other otolaryngology departments, all patients with unknown status are regarded as positive.10\nMethods\nInstitutional ethics committee approval for this project was granted by the Child and Adolescent Health Service Human Research and Ethics Committee. A waiver of consent was approved to complete the audit. The procedure used for MLB in this case series of pediatric patients with unknown COVID-19 status is described. The protocol has been documented and distributed to all theater staff, and a laminated hard copy is in the operating theater.\nDiagnostic MLB with or without therapeutic intervention was performed in the same operating theater for every case. The procedures were performed by a consultant otolaryngologist. Two anesthetists and an anesthetic technician and 2 nurses made up the team in the theater. A clean anesthetic technician and a second circulating nurse remained outside the theater to collect anything that may have been required during the case.\nThe nurse was positioned on the surgeon\u2019s right, with the endoscopy equipment, and the anesthetic team was to the surgeon\u2019s left. All staff in the theater wore personal protective equipment appropriate for an AGP, including an N95 mask or powered air-purifying respirator, a face shield, a hooded surgical cap wrapped around the neck, an impermeable surgical gown, and double gloves.11,12\nAll patients were first anesthetized with volatile gas on the operating table, and intravenous access was secured. In most cases, maintenance of anesthesia was achieved with total intravenous anesthesia. The suspension box (a polymethyl methacrylate [Perspex, Perspex International] box with 3 open sides, routinely used for suspension; Figure 1) was placed over the patient. This box and the patient were covered with a transparent plastic sheet (Figure 2). The sheet extended onto the scrub nurse\u2019s trolley, at the surgeon\u2019s right-hand side. The sheet was secured to the surgeon\u2019s gown with drape tape at waist height. It was also secured to the operating tape below the Perspex box and to the patient\u2019s left.\nThe surgeon\u2019s arms remained under the sheet at all times, with instruments passed under the sheet. The patient was visualized through the sheet and with a Hopkins rod. Indirect laryngoscopy was performed, and the glottis and subglottis were sprayed with lignocaine using a C-MAC video laryngoscope (Karl Storz). Routine MLB has been performed with a straight Miller blade and a rigid Hopkins rod lens telescope. When intervention to the supraglottic or glottic structures (eg, supraglottoplasty or injection laryngoplasty) was planned, the patient was intubated with a cuffed tube as soon as practicable, and the surgeon proceeded with the intervention. Following intervention, the patients were extubated under the plastic sheet in an effort to contain aerosolized particles produced by coughing on extubation. The sheet was removed and discarded, and the child was transferred to the postanesthetic recovery unit.\nFeasibility was assessed by observation of the surgeon\u2019s ability to, first, perform a diagnostic MLB and obtain diagnostic information, and second, to perform intervention using the modified technique. Adverse events were described as intraoperative or postoperative. Intraoperative adverse events included surgical complications and anesthetic complications. Postoperative complications included unexpected postoperative reintubation, unplanned admission to the pediatric critical care unit, or unplanned return to the operating theater.\nResults\nThe modified MLB procedure was performed on 8 pediatric patients using the technique described (Table). Patient median (range) age was 160 days (27 days to 2 years 6 months); 5 patients were male, and 3 were female. The technique was first used March 23, 2020, and the last in the series (prior to submission for publication) was performed on April 9, 2020. All patients and their families had unknown COVID-19 status. No intraoperative or postoperative adverse events were observed. The median (range) follow-up was 24.5 (11-28) days.\nSupraglottoplasty\nTwo patients underwent cold-steel supraglottoplasty for laryngomalacia. Before the COVID-19 pandemic, supraglottoplasty was routinely performed with spontaneous ventilation with a Benjamin-Lindholm laryngoscope in suspension and a microscope for visualization. With the modified protocol, after the diagnostic MLB, the child was intubated with a cuffed endotracheal tube and placed in suspension. The supraglottis was visualized with the Hopkins rod lens telescope, which was inserted into the side port of the Benjamin-Lindholm rigid laryngoscope and held in place by an assistant (Figure 3). The operating surgeon performed a 2-handed supraglottoplasty.\nInjection Laryngoplasty\nModified MLB and filler injection (hyaluronic acid) to treat type 1 clefts were performed in 2 cases with recurrent aspiration. In both cases, following the modified MLB, the patient was intubated with a cuffed endotracheal tube and placed in suspension. The tube remained outside the straight laryngoscope, and the injection was performed under direct vision with the Hopkins rod.\nMLB for Airway Foreign Body Retrieval\nThe fifth patient in the series had a clinical presentation concerning for an inhaled foreign body and underwent an emergency MLB procedure. The modified MLB protocol described was used. No airway foreign body was found. Our planned approach is to perform low-dose computed tomography scanning for all cases with a suspected airway foreign body when clinically safe, but the approach was not deemed safe in this case.\nPatients With Tracheostomy\nIn patients with a tracheostomy, our protocol is to insert a cuffed tracheostomy tube and confirm the absence of a leak prior to surgical intervention to the larynx or suprastomal trachea. During this time, 2 other MLB procedures (one required repair of a laryngeal cleft, and the other progressed to a slide tracheoplasty) were performed without the need for this technique in patients who had tested negative for SARS-CoV-2. Both of these children presented with respiratory illnesses and a fever and therefore were qualified for preoperative testing. The patient who underwent the cleft repair already had a tracheostomy in situ, and the technique identified above was used.\nDiscussion\nThe COVID-19 era is challenging otolaryngologists to change usual practice to ensure the safety of patients and the otolaryngology team. Surgeons and their teams are challenged to consider the indications for surgery: Is the surgery an emergency or urgent procedure? Will a delay result in significant morbidity or mortality? Should alternative investigations and therapeutic options that do not involve AGPs be considered?\nTo reduce the risk to surgeons, the theater team, and patients, changes to surgical protocols and clinical behavior are required. It is essential that any proposed changes are discussed thoroughly with the theater team, with adequate time to prepare. When possible, a simulation of the new process takes place. The most experienced and efficient surgeon, anesthetists, and nursing team should perform the procedure. It is important to predict if any additional equipment may be required and have it available in the operating theater to reduce staff movement while a case is under way. Efficient teamwork is essential. In the case series described, procedures took two to three times longer than during usual conditions.\nThe technique for pediatric MLB described herein continues to evolve. Securing the plastic sheet with drape tape at 3 sides has reduced slippage, improved coverage of the patient, and made it easier for the surgeon to operate beneath it. Use of indirect laryngoscopy with a C-MAC blade for application of topical anesthesia (lignocaine) by the surgeon, under the plastic sheet, is a change from usual practice of application under direct laryngoscopic vision by the anesthetist. Over time, more instruments are being placed under the sheet at the commencement of the procedure to reduce the number of times the side of the sheet must be lifted during the procedure. One needs to balance the risk of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 to health care teams against the risk to the patient of delaying or heavily modifying the procedure.\nWith reconsideration of the surgical approach in light of specific COVID-19 infection risks, the primary aim is to reduce the spread of aerosolized respiratory secretions perioperatively and intraoperatively, while ensuring satisfactory patient outcomes. Supraglottoplasty is performed with a cuffed endotracheal tube rather than an open airway. Cold-steel therapeutic techniques are likely to be less aerosol generating than techniques using powered devices; no cases in the series required intervention with a powered instrument.\nAsymptomatic virus carriage by children is not uncommon,13 and children provide a means of transmission to health care workers and otolaryngologists and subsequent transmission to patients and community spread. For this reason, the described technique is being used for all pediatric patients with unknown or positive COVID-19 status. Preoperative COVID-19 testing was very recently approved at the institution, and preoperative testing in patients undergoing urgent category 1 AGPs will commence. Even though this will reduce the risk to the staff involved, there is still a false-negative rate. Protocols regarding this are currently being evaluated by our institution.\nWorldwide, otolaryngology departments are using and communicating practical strategies to reduce the transmission risk of COVID-19.6,14,15 The otolaryngological surgical community must remain flexible and willing to adapt the approach to surgical procedures as more is understood about SARS-CoV-2. International collaborations among medical professionals of all disciplines have exemplified the response to the COVID-19 pandemic, and the otolaryngology community has been at the forefront of this collaboration.\nLimitations\nThere are limitations to this case series study. The number of cases reported is small, and the technique will continue to evolve as more cases of MLB are performed. Outcome measures were observational, with no control group. There is a lack of representativeness and generalizability of a small, single-centered series with currently low levels of SARS-CoV-2 transmission.\nConclusions\nIn this small case series, we demonstrated the feasibility of use of a modified technique for pediatric MLB. By reconsidering the surgical approach in light of specific COVID-19 infection risks, this technique may help to reduce the spread of aerosolized respiratory secretions perioperatively and intraoperatively, but the technique and patient outcomes require further study.\nBack to top\nArticle Information\nAccepted for Publication: April 20, 2020.\nCorresponding Author: Katherine Pollaers, MBBS, MSurg, Perth Children\u2019s Hospital, 15 Hospital Ave, Nedlands WA 6009, Australia (katherine.pollaers@gmail.com).\nPublished Online: April 28, 2020. doi:10.1001/jamaoto.2020.1191\nAuthor Contributions: Dr Pollaers had full access to all of the data in the study and takes responsibility for the integrity of the data and the accuracy of the data analysis.\nStudy concept and design: Pollaers, Vijayasekaran.\nAcquisition, analysis, or interpretation of data: All authors.\nDrafting of the manuscript: Pollaers, Vijayasekaran.\nCritical revision of the manuscript for important intellectual content: Herbert, Vijayasekaran.\nStatistical analysis: Vijayasekaran.\nAdministrative, technical, or material support: Herbert, Vijayasekaran.\nStudy supervision: Herbert, Vijayasekaran.\nConflict of Interest Disclosures: None reported.\nDisclaimer: The views expressed in this article are the views of the authors and not an official position of the institution.\nAdditional Contributions: We thank the patient for granting permission to publish the clinical photographs.\nReferences\n1.\nGengler  I\ufeff , Wang  J\ufeff , Speth  M\ufeff , Sedaghat  A\ufeff .

The attack rate was higher among contacts whose exposure to the index case started within 5 days of symptom onset than those who were exposed later.\nMeaning  High transmissibility of COVID-19 before and immediately after symptom onset suggests that finding and isolating symptomatic patients alone may not suffice to interrupt transmission, and that more generalized measures might be required, such as social distancing.\nAbstract\nImportance  The dynamics of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) transmissibility are yet to be fully understood. Better understanding of the transmission dynamics is important for the development and evaluation of effective control policies.\nObjective  To delineate the transmission dynamics of COVID-19 and evaluate the transmission risk at different exposure window periods before and after symptom onset.\nDesign, Setting, and Participants  This prospective case-ascertained study in Taiwan included laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19 and their contacts. The study period was from January 15 to March 18, 2020. All close contacts were quarantined at home for 14 days after their last exposure to the index case. During the quarantine period, any relevant symptoms (fever, cough, or other respiratory symptoms) of contacts triggered a COVID-19 test. The final follow-up date was April 2, 2020.\nMain Outcomes and Measures  Secondary clinical attack rate (considering symptomatic cases only) for different exposure time windows of the index cases and for different exposure settings (such as household, family, and health care).\nResults  We enrolled 100 confirmed patients, with a median age of 44 years (range, 11-88 years), including 56 men and 44 women. Among their 2761 close contacts, there were 22 paired index-secondary cases. The overall secondary clinical attack rate was 0.7% (95% CI, 0.4%-1.0%). The attack rate was higher among the 1818 contacts whose exposure to index cases started within 5 days of symptom onset (1.0% [95% CI, 0.6%-1.6%]) compared with those who were exposed later (0 cases from 852 contacts; 95% CI, 0%-0.4%). The 299 contacts with exclusive presymptomatic exposures were also at risk (attack rate, 0.7% [95% CI, 0.2%-2.4%]). The attack rate was higher among household (4.6% [95% CI, 2.3%-9.3%]) and nonhousehold (5.3% [95% CI, 2.1%-12.8%]) family contacts than that in health care or other settings. The attack rates were higher among those aged 40 to 59 years (1.1% [95% CI, 0.6%-2.1%]) and those aged 60 years and older (0.9% [95% CI, 0.3%-2.6%]).\nConclusions and Relevance  In this study, high transmissibility of COVID-19 before and immediately after symptom onset suggests that finding and isolating symptomatic patients alone may not suffice to contain the epidemic, and more generalized measures may be required, such as social distancing.\nIntroduction\nThe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak that originated in Wuhan, China, spread to more than 100 countries within 2 months of when the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was identified in January 2020.1,2 Following the Wuhan lockdown and other extreme social-distancing measures conducted by the Chinese government, several countries with widespread outbreaks implemented similar measures, including shutting down entire cities or communities, banning international or domestic travel, conducting border control with symptom screening, and implementing isolation and quarantine.\nThe unknown epidemiologic characteristics and transmission dynamics of a novel pathogen, such as SARS-CoV-2, complicate the development and evaluation of effective control policies.3 The serial interval of COVID-19, defined as the interval between the infection time of the index case and that of the secondary case, was found to be short (4-5 days) and was similar to the estimated incubation period.4 The short serial interval of COVID-19 and results from viral shedding studies suggested that most transmission occurred near or even before the time of symptom onset.4-6 On the other hand, prolonged viral shedding raised concerns about prolonged infectiousness of patients and the need for extended isolation. A few preliminary contact-tracing studies showed that the highest-risk exposure setting of COVID-19 transmission was the household.7-9 Nevertheless, it is not known when and how long a patient with COVID-19 should be isolated or whether close contacts should be quarantined. Additional information is needed about the transmission risk at different time points before and after symptom onset and with different types of exposures, such as through the household or a health care facility.\nIn Taiwan, the first COVID-19 case was confirmed on January 21, 2020.10 With proactive containment efforts and comprehensive contact tracing, the number of COVID-19 cases remained low, as compared with other countries that had widespread outbreaks.11,12 Using the contact tracing data in Taiwan, we aimed to delineate the transmission dynamics of COVID-19, evaluate the infection risk at different exposure windows, and estimate the infectious period.\nMethods\nStudy Population\nOn January 15, 2020, in response to the outbreak in Wuhan, the Taiwan Centers for Disease Control (Taiwan CDC) made COVID-19 a notifiable disease. We conducted a prospective case-ascertained study that enrolled all the initial 100 confirmed cases in Taiwan between January 15 and March 18, 2020, and their close contacts. All contacts were followed up until 14 days after the last exposure to the index case. The last follow-up date was April 2, 2020.\nThe study followed the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) reporting guideline.13 Information was collected according to the pronouncement of the Central Epidemic Command Center and in accordance with Article 17 of the Communicable Disease Control Act.14 As part of the public health response functions of the Central Epidemic Command Center for surveillance purposes, institutional review board approval of this study and informed consent were waived. Prior to analysis, the data were deidentified.\nAscertainment of Cases\nA confirmed case met the criteria of notification for COVID-19 in Taiwan and tested positive by real-time reverse transcriptase\u2013polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test.15 Detailed information, including demographic and clinical data, was reported to the National Notifiable Disease Surveillance System.16 The investigation team determined the clinical severity of the confirmed patients following the World Health Organization (WHO) interim guidance.17\nContact Tracing for COVID-19\nWhen a patient was laboratory-confirmed to have SARS-CoV-2 infection, a thorough epidemiological investigation, including contact tracing, was implemented by the outbreak investigation team of the Taiwan CDC and local health authorities. The period of investigation started at the date at symptom onset (and could be extended to up to 4 days before symptom onset when epidemiologically indicated) and ended at the date at COVID-19 confirmation. For asymptomatic confirmed cases, the period of investigation was based on the date at confirmation (instead of date at onset) and was determined according to epidemiological investigation. The definition of a close contact was a person who did not wear appropriate personal protection equipment (PPE) while having face-to-face contact with a confirmed case for more than 15 minutes during the investigation period. A contact was listed as a household contact if he or she lived in the same household with the index case. Those listed as family contacts were family members not living in the same household.\nFor health care settings, medical staff, hospital workers, and other patients in the same setting were included; close contact was defined by contacting an index case within 2 m without appropriate PPE and without a minimal requirement of exposure time. Whether the PPE was regarded as \u201cappropriate\u201d depended on the exposure setting and the procedures performed. For example, for physicians who performed aerosol-generating procedures, such as intubation, an N95 respirator was required. For such procedures, a surgical mask would not be appropriate PPE. Accordingly, the medical staff would be listed as a close contact.\nAll close contacts were quarantined at home for 14 days after their last exposure to the index case. During the quarantine period, any relevant symptoms (fever, cough, or other respiratory symptoms) of close contacts would trigger RT-PCR testing for COVID-19. For high-risk populations, including household and hospital contacts, RT-PCR was performed regardless of symptoms. Essentially, these high-risk contacts were tested once when they were listed as a close contact. If the initial COVID-19 test result was negative, further testing would only be performed if a close contact developed symptoms during quarantine. The Taiwan CDC used an electronic tracing system (Infectious Disease Contact Tracing Platform and Management System) to follow and record the daily health status of those quarantined contacts.18 The information collected included age, sex, the index case, date at exposure, and the exposure setting.\nData Processing and Analysis\nPaired data of index case and close contacts were extracted from the contact tracing database and outbreak investigation reports. For a family cluster, the index case was determined based on the temporality of symptom onset and review of the epidemiological link. A secondary case was excluded from the paired data if the beginning of exposure was after symptom onset of the secondary case (only applied when the secondary case was symptomatic). For health care contacts, the date at exposure would be the date at admission of the case if the exact date at exposure was not recorded.\nIncubation period and serial interval were estimated using the contact tracing data in Taiwan and publicly available data sets globally (eMethods in the Supplement). We used the Bayesian hierarchical model to increase the stability in small-sample estimation. The exposure window period was defined as the period between the first and last day of reported exposure to the index case based on contact investigation. Following the WHO, we defined the secondary clinical attack rate as the ratio of symptomatic confirmed cases among the close contacts.19 We analyzed the dynamic change of secondary clinical attack rate in relation to symptom onset of the index case (days <0, 0-3, 4-5, 6-7, 8-9, or >9).\nThe percentage of missing information was small (7.0% for age, 6.1% for sex, and 3.3% for time from onset to exposure; Table 1). In the univariable analysis of secondary clinical attack rate by different exposure characteristics (eg, age), close contacts with missing information in that particular exposure attribute were excluded. All statistical tests were 2-sided with an \u03b1 level of .05. All confidence intervals (CIs) were 95%. R software (R Foundation for Statistical Computing) and RStan (Stan Development Team) were used for data management and analysis.\nResults\nAs of March 18, 2020, there were 100 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 in Taiwan, including 10 clusters of patients and 9 asymptomatic patients. The median age of the 100 patients was 44 years old (range, 11-88 years); 56 were men and 44 were women. Of the 2761 close contacts that were identified, 5.5% were household contacts, 2.8% were non-household family contacts, and 25.3% were health care contacts (Table 1). Through contact tracing, 23 secondary cases were found. One of the 23 cases was excluded from subsequent transmission-pair analysis because the documented day at exposure occurred after symptom onset of the secondary case. None of the 9 asymptomatic case patients transmitted a secondary case. Using the data on the 22 paired cases, we estimated that the median incubation period was 4.1 days (95% credible interval [CrI], 0.4-15.8), and the median serial interval was 4.1 days (95% CrI, 0.1-27.8) (eTables 1-5 and eFigures 1-5 in the Supplement).\nAmong the 2761 close contacts, 22 secondary cases of COVID-19 infection (including 4 asymptomatic infections) were detected, with an infection risk of 0.8% (95% CI, 0.5%-1.2%). The secondary clinical attack rate was 18 of 2761, or 0.7% (95% CI, 0.4%-1.0%). Figure 1 shows the exposure window of all contacts. All of the 22 secondary cases had their first exposure before the sixth day of the index case\u2019s symptom onset. By comparison, only 68% of noncase contacts had their first exposure before day 6 (Table 1). The secondary clinical attack rate was higher among those whose initial exposure to the index case was within 5 days of symptom onset than those who were exposed after day 6 (zero transmission of 852 contacts [95% CI, 0%-0.4%]) (Table 2 and Figure 2A). The 735 contacts whose initial exposure occurred before symptom onset of the index case were also at risk, with a secondary clinical attack rate of 1.0% (95% CI, 0.5%-2.0%). A subgroup of 299 contacts with exclusive presymptomatic exposures were also at risk (secondary clinical attack rate, 0.7% [95% CI, 0.2%-2.4%]).\nThe secondary clinical attack rate was 4.6% (95% CI, 2.3%-9.3%) among 151 household contacts and 5.3% (95% CI, 2.1%-12.8%) in 76 nonhousehold family contacts (Table 2). The high attack rate from early exposure remained when the analysis was restricted to household and nonhousehold family contacts (Table 3 and Figure 2B). The attack rates were higher among those aged 40 to 59 years (1.1% [95% CI, 0.6%-2.1%]) and those aged 60 years and older (0.9% [95% CI, 0.3%-2.6%]). The 786 close contacts of the 6 confirmed cases presenting with severe disease were at a higher risk compared with the 1097 close contacts of the 56 cases presenting with mild disease (risk ratio, 3.76 [95% CI, 1.10-12.76] and 3.99 [95% CI, 1.00-15.84] for severe pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome/sepsis, respectively). Among the 91 close contacts of the 9 asymptomatic cases, no secondary transmission was observed. The secondary attack rate among contacts of cases with infection acquired in Taiwan was higher than that among contacts of cases with infection acquired outside of Taiwan (Table 2).\nDiscussion\nOur analysis of close contacts to confirmed COVID-19 cases revealed a relatively short infectious period of COVID-19 and a higher transmission risk around the time of symptom onset of the index case, followed by a lower transmission risk at the later stage of disease. The observed decreasing transmission risk over time for COVID-19 was in striking contrast to the transmission pattern of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), in which the transmission risk remained low until after day 5 of symptom onset in the index cases.20 Our study and the study by Nishiura et al4 revealed a short serial interval of COVID-19, with a median of 4 to 5 days. In contrast, the mean serial interval of SARS was estimated to be 8.4 days in Singapore.20 The present contact tracing analysis suggested that the shorter serial interval of COVID-19 was due to the combination of early-stage transmission and a short period of infectiousness.\nThe observed pattern of the secondary clinical attack rate over time was also consistent with the quantitative data of the SARS-CoV-2 viral shedding in upper respiratory specimens, which has been found in China to be a high viral load around the time of symptom onset, followed by a gradual decrease in viral shedding to a low level after 10 days.5 The viral load was similar among asymptomatic, minimally symptomatic, and symptomatic patients. Another virological study in patients with COVID-19 in Germany also found no viable isolates of the virus after the first week of symptoms.21 Our findings agree with the virological data on high transmissibility of COVID-19 in the first week after the onset of symptoms and decreased risk afterwards.21 We also documented and quantified the transmission potential of COVID-19 in a subgroup of contacts whose exposure occurred exclusively during the presymptomatic period of the index case. Our analysis revealed a similar clinical attack rate between the contacts who only had presymptomatic exposure and those who had postsymptomatic exposure.\nTo summarize the evidence, the decreasing risk for secondary infection over time in our study, the observed short serial interval, and the trend of decreasing viral shedding and viability after symptom onset strongly suggested high transmissibility of the disease near or even before the day of symptom onset. Because the onset of overt clinical symptoms, such as fever, dyspnea, and signs of pneumonia, usually occurred 5 to 7 days after initial symptom onset, the infection might well have been transmitted at or before the time of detection.22,23 This characteristic makes containment efforts challenging. In a modeling study, Hellewell et al24 found that the possibility of controlling COVID-19 through isolation and contact tracing decreased with increasing proportion of transmission that occurred before symptom onset. The findings of this modeling study, when viewed in the context of our findings, might help to explain the difficult situation in such areas and countries as China, South Korea, Iran, and Italy. Aggressive social distancing and proactive contact tracing might be necessary to block the transmission chain of COVID-19 and to keep presumptive patients away from susceptible populations with a high risk for severe disease.\nThe observed short duration of infectiousness with lower risk of transmission 1 week after symptom onset has important implications for redirecting the efforts to control COVID-19. Given the nonspecific and mostly mild symptoms of COVID-19 at presentation, patients are often identified and hospitalized at a later stage of disease when the transmissibility of infection has started to decrease. In this case, hospitalization would not be helpful for isolation and reducing transmission, and should be only for patients whose clinical course is sufficiently severe. When the number of confirmed cases rapidly increases, home care for patients with mild illness may be preferred.25 In Taiwan (where patients with COVID-19 have been routinely hospitalized), the most prolonged duration of hospital isolation for the 100 confirmed cases was more than 2 months. If every patient with mild illness is to be isolated in the hospital or other isolation facilities for such a prolonged period during a large epidemic, the health care system would soon be overwhelmed, and the case-fatality rate may increase, as observed in Wuhan.26,27 Similarly, better understanding of the potential duration of transmission could help direct containment strategies. For example, contact tracing could focus on the contacts near or even before symptom onset of the index cases when the number of index cases or contacts is too large for all contacts to be traced, given the available resources.\nSeveral patients in our study were initially considered to have pneumonia of unknown etiology and had multiple contacts in the health care setting before being diagnosed. However, the number of health care contacts that led to nosocomial transmission was low. Besides the basic PPE used by medical staffs, this finding might be due to the late admissions of these patients and their lower risk of transmitting COVID-19 by the time of hospitalization. This pattern is compatible with the observations in China and Hong Kong. In China, the number of nosocomial infections might be lower than reported because some health care workers acquired infections in their households rather than in the health care faciltiy.9 In Hong Kong, most hospitalization was also delayed to at least 5 days after disease onset.28 In closed settings such as a hospital or a cruise ship,29,30 fomite transmission might play an important role, amplifying the risk of transmission and making the temporality of transmission less identifiable.30-32 Better understanding of the dynamic change of transmissibility of COVID-19 over time and how health care workers are most likely to be infected could allow for better targeting of control measures, including the use of appropriate PPE.\nIn the contact tracing cohort, we observed a relatively low transmission rate of COVID-19. During the study period (January to early March 2020), the major containment measures in Taiwan were travel alerts with restriction to affected countries (principally China), home quarantine for travelers entering Taiwan, and comprehensive contact tracing for confirmed cases.11 In response to a possible shortage of face masks, the government proactively initiated a name-based rationing system for mask purchase and boosted the production of face masks to ensure the availability for both N95 respirators and face masks to both health care professionals and the general public. A general recommendation on social distancing from the government was not in place, but spontaneous behavioral changes that reduced community mobility were observed.33\nLimitations\nOur study has limitations. First, we did not completely examine contacts before the symptom onset of the index cases. Therefore, we might have underestimated the importance of early transmission. Thus, the actual contribution of early transmission to new infections could be greater than our estimates suggests. Our findings agree with the recommendation from the WHO to use 4 days before symptom onset as the starting date for contact tracing.19 This modification may help to further understand the pattern of early transmission in COVID-19. Second, we could not completely separate out the effect of close household contact and early contact given the strong correlation of the 2. The increased transmissibility in the early stage of COVID-19 may be partially attributed to the effect of household and nonhousehold family contacts rather than increased infectiousness at the early stage. When we stratified by type of exposure, however, the pattern of early transmission remained.\nConclusions\nIn summary, the findings of this study suggest that most transmission of COVID-19 occurred at the very early stage of the disease or even before the onset of symptoms, and the secondary clinical attack rate among contacts decreased over time as symptoms developed and progressed. The pattern of high transmissibility near and before symptom onset and the likely short infectious period of the virus could inform control strategies for COVID-19, as well as additional studies to fully elucidate the transmission dynamics of the virus.\nBack to top\nArticle Information\nAccepted for Publication: April 21, 2020.\nPublished Online: May 1, 2020. doi:10.1001/jamainternmed.2020.2020\nOpen Access: This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the CC-BY License. \u00a9 2020 Cheng H-Y et al.

Systems span regional and state boundaries to provide state-of-the-art care to patients with a wide variety of medical needs. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a rapidly spreading pandemic that is challenging health care systems across the globe. Systems have faced varying complexities adapting to the new reality, and patients may pay a grievous price when the demand for medical and critical care exceeds the supply. This pandemic continues to escalate rapidly in hot spots nationally and internationally, and the worst strain on our health care systems may be yet to come.\nThe importance of preparation is highlighted when we consider the needs of our own family members, whether for COVID-19\u2013associated care or another urgent medical condition. The inability to access potentially life-saving care because of lost opportunities to prepare is heartbreaking. The purpose of this article is to provide a road map developed from lessons learned from our experience in the Department of Surgery at the University of Wisconsin (UW) School of Medicine and Public Health and UW Health, based on our past experience with incident command structures in military combat operations and Federal Emergency Management Agency response. We will discuss administrative restructuring leveraging a team-of-teams approach, provide a framework for deploying the workforce needed to deliver all necessary urgent health care and critical care to patients in our system, and consider implications for the future.\nSystem Overview\nAt the UW, the health system is integrated with the School of Medicine and Public Health to manage all aspects of patient care. As the COVID-19 pandemic began to spread globally, UW quickly recognized the need to adapt and evolve practice. The health system activated the hospital\u2019s incident command team weeks before the epidemic hit the state to initiate a system-wide response to this pandemic. The Department of Surgery contributes surgical assets throughout all aspects of the health system, which spans the entire state of Wisconsin and parts of northern Illinois. However, this review will focus on the response developed and deployed in the Madison, Wisconsin, hospitals. At the time of this writing, we have started to see a rapid increase in patients with COVID-19 in Wisconsin, but the peak surge is estimated to still be nearly a week away. These plans were conceived and implemented prior to the beginning of the surge. We felt strongly that early implementation would allow for processes to be iteratively adapted to the needs of the oncoming COVID-19 surge.\nHospital System Incident Command and Department of Surgery Response\nThe health system\u2019s Incident Command Team recognized that the specific challenges of COVID-19 were different from the prior incidents it has managed. The planning and operations around a mass casualty incident or an acute shortage of a resource, such as an information technology shutdown, are different than what is required for a sustained response over a prolonged period of weeks, months, or longer. In addition, this pandemic can affect and diminish the workforce itself, requiring a layered approach to staffing models to adjust for anticipated absenteeism. The main difference from our prior experiences was the need to provide a workforce capable of caring for large numbers of patients with critical illness over a protracted period, with appropriate backup built in.\nInitial steps included cessation of all elective inpatient surgical care with prioritization of urgent and emergency cases only. Additionally, ambulatory care was converted to telehealth visits only. This allowed us to focus on reorganizing our department\u2019s clinician structure to meet an increase in workforce demands for the health system. The Department of Surgery includes 11 subspecialty divisions, with 5 divisions previously falling under the umbrella of general surgery: surgical oncology, minimally invasive surgery, endocrine surgery, colorectal surgery, and acute care and regional general surgery. The department sponsors 4 primary surgical residencies with cohorts of 6 to 52 resident physicians each: general surgery, plastic surgery, otolaryngology, and vascular surgery. In addition, we have a large advanced practice professional (APP) workforce (made up of nurse practitioners and physician assistants), supporting both ambulatory and inpatient clinical operations. Typically, faculty members, residents, and APPs are assigned to 1 of the 11 subspecialty services and have individual schedules with no backup other than shifting work internally within their small teams.\nMeeting the challenge of COVID-19 required a reorientation of our administrative structure within the Department of Surgery. In the book Team of Teams: New Rules of Engagement for a Complex World,1 Stanley A. McChrystal describes how to move from a more hierarchical and traditional structure in which information flows up the chain and decisions come down in a linear fashion to a structure that is more fluid and agile. This team-of-teams concept is dependent on the free flow of information among and between various teams, as well as a clearly communicated mission. Teams must have a shared consciousness of how and why.\nCommunication\nWe operationalized this concept and defined our mission as providing urgent surgical and critical care to all who need it. Communication has been a major focus. We have instituted twice-daily 30-minute conference calls within and between the various teams in our department. These calls are designed to disseminate consistent information to all team members at the same time. They function to allow concerns to be elevated or share new information among and between teams. To reduce the volume of email, we leveraged secure texting applications to establish specific chat groups for critical information that needs to be shared between conference calls. These chat groups share information in real time, allowing for agile adaptation to rapidly changing situations. Figure 1 shows how individual departments and interdisciplinary cross-departmental teams must engage in constant bidirectional communication with each other and with the central hospital Incident Command System to respond to a pandemic such as COVID-19.\nGuiding Principles\nWe formulated a list of guiding principles to act as a cornerstone for our decisions and attempted to adhere to these principles as much as was practical.\nWe are committed to structuring COVID-19 services in a multidisciplinary fashion that are agile and flexible, to respond effectively and provide remarkable health care.\nWe will maintain workforce to provide other urgent health care needs of all patients, whether they have COVID-19 or not.\nAttending physicians, fellows, residents, and APPs must be agile and flexible regarding shift schedules, locations, etc.\nWe need to synchronize clinical operation periods throughout departments.\nWe will be responsible stewards of personal protective equipment.\nWe will accomplish these things with the physical and psychological safety of clinicians at the front of mind.\nWe will strive to limit any one group\u2019s exposure to COVID-19\u2013intense settings as much as possible.\nWe will advocate for procedures and resources needed to protect clinicians.\nFocus on Workforce\nAs planning for the critical care and acute inpatient needs of patients with COVID-19 continued, we realized that we could not make our plans in a vacuum\u2014every department and clinical unit is interdependent in some way. Formation of an interdisciplinary team with members drawn from multiple departments was required to meet the needs of large numbers of patients with COVID-19 who were in the intensive care units and on inpatient floors. The primary threat was outstripping our internal human resources to meet the rapidly escalating patient care demands. To meet the increased tempo of intensive care unit and hospital medicine operations, we would need to pull clinicians from across all departments in the health system. Clinicians would become independent of their traditional specialties\u2014such as surgery, ophthalmology, anesthesia, family practice, and medical subspecialties\u2014to provide a united clinical response to the expected surge in patients with COVID-19. At the same time, departments would need to ensure that they retained sufficient workforce for urgent subspecialty care. To accomplish this, we used the following framework to reorganize our surgical services and design cross-departmental care teams for the intensive care unit and the hospital medicine services.\nOrganizational Framework\nThe paradigm used for staffing redesign within the Department of Surgery as well as for the cross-departmental teams in the intensive care unit, the COVID-19 floor, and the stepdown unit was based on the tiered care systems suggested by the Society of Critical Care Medicine.2 In this system, a content expert oversees up to 4 teams that are staffed with clinicians at various levels of experience, allowing the content expert to care for more patients than would otherwise be possible using normal staffing models. In the intensive care unit environment, the content expert is an attending physician who is board certified in critical care or surgical critical care and active in the care of patients who are critically ill during normal operations. These clinicians were identified by each department that provides critical care services. This system requires synchronization of schedules across hospital departments and divisions so that clinicians can move seamlessly across services without disrupting or leaving gaps in schedules in their home division or department. To build these teams, we needed to understand the competencies required for each tier and the competencies present within our potential workforce. Because clinicians with varying levels of experience will manage patients that will require intubation and venous and arterial catheter access, we also needed to organize strike teams to provide these specialized services when required. These strike teams broaden the pool of clinicians that can contribute to intensive care unit\u2013specific and COVID-19\u2013specific teams without requiring additional procedural training.\nSynchronizing Work Cycles\nTo create a pool of clinicians that could be deployed in layered teams either on the surgical services or the hospital medicine and critical care teams, all schedules had to be synchronized across the system. This required all residency programs, subspecialty surgical services, and APP schedules (both inpatient and ambulatory) to align with a modular schedule of 5-day blocks and 12-hour shifts. The 5-day block provides a good balance between prioritizing clinicians\u2019 physical and psychological safety when caring for patients with COVID-19 and minimizing excessive handoffs. Additionally, societal time standards have already been disrupted by shutdowns and social distancing measures; therefore, there was no compelling reason to adhere to a 7-day system. Every day is essentially a Saturday. Should a clinician experience an unprotected exposure to COVID-19, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s recommended 14-day quarantine period fits into 3 of these interchangeable blocks.3 Another important factor of the interchangeable system is that the scheduling paradigm spreads the burden of care across the entire health care workforce. This creates an all-in spirit and avoids the erosive narrative in which some clinicians assume a much higher risk while their colleagues are more protected. All other clinical departments in UW Health synchronized their schedules in the same manner so that they could also contribute clinicians to these layered and cross-departmental critical care and hospital medicine teams while continuing to provide urgent and emergency care to their usual patient populations. The operating rooms were also staffed to a 7-day-a-week model with 12-hour shifts so that they could provide predictable staffing models as more anesthesia clinicians were pulled to support critical care and airway strike team operations with the COVID-19 surge. Of course, local resources and considerations may not allow for synchronizing of schedules, or some locations may find a different cadence is appropriate. We felt that this particular cadence struck a good balance for our situation.\nUnderstanding Competencies\nIn creating consolidated surgical services as we prepared for COVID-19 surge, we surveyed our faculty across all divisions in the Department of Surgery to ascertain their comfort level in caring for patients in need of acute emergency general surgery or patients requiring surgical critical care. Likewise, we evaluated the competencies of our APP workforce to understand who had experience delivering care in the inpatient setting, in what disciplines, and who could provide first-assist support in the operating room if needed (Table 1). This allowed us to build a leveled grid of clinician competencies (Table 2), ranging from an attending physician who is a content expert to a clinician qualified to see patients with direct supervision. It is important to note that for levels 2, 3, and 4, clinicians could come from various pools, including attending physicians, fellows, APPs, and residents. As an example of how this leveled competency system can be used to create a tiered service, the levels and number of clinicians needed to staff our collapsed trauma, emergency general surgery, and burn services are shown in eFigure 1 in the Supplement.\nBuilding the Teams\nOnce the staffing structure was specified and work cycles were determined, we asked the specialty general surgery services to create coverage schema that would allow for care of patients on their services while also supplying surgeons to staff the combined trauma, emergency general surgery, and burn (TEB) service. Each division was asked to provide an attending physician to staff the TEB service for every other work cycle. We also created a super-rounder position, responsible for rounding on the consolidated general surgery specialty service. For example, in work cycle 1, a breast surgeon participated as the super-rounder for the consolidated services and a colorectal surgeon worked as the daytime surgeon for the collapsed TEB service. We layered in backup from an acute care/trauma surgeon who is also the clinical operations attending physician of the day. The clinical operations attending physician is responsible for taking all requests of transfer into the system, triaging those requests, and distributing patients to the teams. This person is also responsible for solving scheduling issues that come up as clinicians move in and out of the workforce because of health-associated or other issues.\nThe Resident and APP Workforce\nOur residents and APPs are most of the level 3 and 4 clinicians needed for the surgical teams, as well as the workforce for the teams caring for patients with COVID-19 in the intensive care unit and on the floor. To create a deep bench of clinicians who can be deployed across inpatient services based on comfort level and appropriate supervision, we collapsed our experienced inpatient and operative-assist APPs with our surgical resident workforce into a single pool of clinicians. This larger pool also allowed for the creation of multiple layers of redundancy and the ability to keep part of the workforce at home waiting for deployment in the event of illness or quarantine absenteeism.\nTo align our surgical training programs with the broader institutional response, we took an inventory of all trainees within the general surgery residency as well as our integrated training programs in vascular surgery, plastic surgery, and otolaryngology. The APPs throughout the department were included, with a plan to deploy them in a similar fashion to assist with service coverage. We sought to cover all of the surgical services using a maximum of half of our trainees and APPs at any given time, such that the remaining half could be deployed to medical and critical care services for care of patients with COVID-19 or could be positioned at home awaiting deployment. Teams covering the surgical services covered both inpatient care and operating room cases for their respective services, as depicted in Figure 2. Residents were pulled from any outpatient clinic responsibilities. Night float was covered by an intern float service with rotating home-call senior backup from residents on their 5-day block, with exceptions for the night trauma, intensive care unit, and off-site services, which had dedicated in-house residents (Figure 2).\nWe elected to use a 20-day cycle, with trainees covering the surgical services for 10 days, followed by 5 days of potential COVID-19 care and 5 days off. For residents rotating in the combined medical/surgical intensive care unit, we elected to shorten the period of clinical work to 5 days on followed by 5 days off, to align with the other members of this team. Subspecialty training programs covered themselves with a similar 20-day block system. Any additional residents not used by their own service were redeployed to assist in the coverage of the remainder of the surgical services. In a departmental effort to consolidate workforce, we elected to stop all surgical coverage at 1 hospital that performed primarily elective procedures but did have an emergency department and a low volume of urgent or emergency general surgery consults. These urgent and emergency cases were transferred to one of our other institutions where surgical services persisted. The trainee coverage of all surgical services is shown in Figure 2.\nClinical and Educational Changes\nTo minimize the number of personnel required to cover the surgical services, residents were removed from certain responsibilities. As outpatient clinic visits had decreased and converted to telehealth, faculty were instructed that residents would no longer be used to cover the clinic. Residents with high-risk comorbidities were held out of clinical responsibilities but assigned to answer patient calls from home. This allowed home-based resident teams to take some workload off the residents in the hospital, while ensuring that they would not have a work-associated COVID-19 exposure. To maintain an educational curriculum for the trainees, a daily online video conference was organized to provide 2 hours of educational content each weekday. These were led by the residents who were currently off service and moderated by a faculty member with content expertise.\nApplication of Organizational Framework to Critical Care and Hospital Medicine\nMost patients presenting with COVID-19 and requiring hospitalization will be on a general hospital or intermediate care medicine service, with 5% to 7% requiring intensive care.4 It is clear that other clinicians will need to provide support for both patients with and without COVID-19 on the hospitalist medicine and critical care services. We therefore worked in partnership with intensive care unit leaders from 4 other departments (internal medicine, emergency medicine, anesthesia, and neurosurgery), as well as leadership from hospital medicine, to survey faculty and APPs across all departments in the health system (Table 1) to assess how clinicians might be deployed in a layered cross-departmental team. We created competency grids similar to Table 2 and built critical care and hospital medicine teams using the same basic design outlined by the Society of Critical Care Medicine.2 eFigure 2 in the Supplement displays the levels of clinicians required for day and night coverage for COVID-19 critical care units.\nDevelopment of Strike Teams\nAs the viral load of COVID-19 is highest in the upper airways and nasopharynx, intubation and airway management are the highest-risk procedures in a patient with COVID-19, because of potential aerosolization of the virus. Surgical airways are not recommended in this patient population for the same reason, so the rate of success with orotracheal intubation needs to be high. Therefore, these high-risk procedures should be performed by the most skilled workforce, to minimize overall risk. We created airway strike teams as shown in Figure 1 to deploy across the system. These teams are led by an anesthesia faculty with 2 level 3 type clinicians that will be drawn from anesthesia and otolaryngology. This allows for a deep bench of clinicians with expertise to perform these procedures as safely as possible. Defining this competency separately and attaching a workforce to it also allowed for easier deployment of residents, APPs, and faculty members to environments that they may be less familiar with, such as the intensive care unit, because they did not have to be prepared to perform intubation.\nDemobilization and Implications for Future Operations\nIt is tempting to focus only on the crisis directly in front of us, but the current pandemic is just the beginning. When hospitals finally begin demobilizing their COVID-19\u2013specific infrastructures, demand for delayed elective care will surge, causing a new stress on hospital systems. Instead of returning to the status quo by retracting back into traditional silos and providing medical care as we always have, the agile hospital system must continue to adapt to provide efficient care during this secondary surge. Ultimately, we will likely need to seek out and embrace a new normal in which best practices developed during the pandemic continue to shape the medical care processes of the future.\nBack to top\nArticle Information\nAccepted for Publication: April 3, 2020.\nCorresponding Author: Ben L.

The effective reproduction number of SARS-CoV-2 (an indicator of secondary transmission) was also calculated over the periods.\nResults  Among 32 583 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases, the median patient age was 56.7 years (range, 0-103; interquartile range, 43.4-66.8) and 16 817 (51.6%) were women. The daily confirmed case rate peaked in the third period and declined afterward across geographic regions and sex and age groups, except for children and adolescents, whose rate of confirmed cases continued to increase. The daily confirmed case rate over the whole period in local health care workers (130.5 per million people [95% CI, 123.9-137.2]) was higher than that in the general population (41.5 per million people [95% CI, 41.0-41.9]). The proportion of severe and critical cases decreased from 53.1% to 10.3% over the 5 periods. The severity risk increased with age: compared with those aged 20 to 39 years (proportion of severe and critical cases, 12.1%), elderly people (\u226580 years) had a higher risk of having severe or critical disease (proportion, 41.3%; risk ratio, 3.61 [95% CI, 3.31-3.95]) while younger people (<20 years) had a lower risk (proportion, 4.1%; risk ratio, 0.47 [95% CI, 0.31-0.70]). The effective reproduction number fluctuated above 3.0 before January 26, decreased to below 1.0 after February 6, and decreased further to less than 0.3 after March 1.\nConclusions and Relevance  A series of multifaceted public health interventions was temporally associated with improved control of the COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan, China. These findings may inform public health policy in other countries and regions.\nIntroduction\nCoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an emerging respiratory infectious disease caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which was first detected in early December 2019 in Wuhan, China. As of April 6, 2020, COVID-19 had quickly spread to the majority of countries worldwide, affected more than 1.1 million individuals, and caused nearly 63\u202f000 deaths.1 Although studies have described the clinical characteristics of patients with COVID-19,2-7 and a previous study has reported the early transmission dynamics of the first 425 confirmed cases in Wuhan,8 more recent data are required to illustrate the full spectrum of the epidemiological characteristics of the outbreak in the epicenter.\nSeveral modeling studies have used the international cases exported from Wuhan to extrapolate the severity of the epidemic,9-13 estimating that the Wuhan travel ban delayed the epidemic progression by 3 to 5 days in mainland China,12,13 while reducing case importations to other countries by nearly 80% through mid-February.12 However, to our knowledge, no study has yet comprehensively evaluated the association of various public health interventions implemented by the Chinese government (including but not limited to intensive intracity and intercity traffic restriction, social distancing measures, home isolation and centralized quarantine, and improvement of medical resources; Figure 1) with outbreak control within Wuhan city.\nIn this study, the epidemiological characteristics of patients with COVID-19 in Wuhan through March 8, 2020, were described, and the rate of confirmed cases and effective reproduction number in different periods according to key events and interventions were compared to evaluate the temporal associations of multiple public health interventions with control of the COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan.\nMethods\nSource of Data\nCharacteristics of patients with COVID-19 from December 2019 through March 8, 2020, were extracted on March 9 from the municipal Notifiable Disease Report System, including birth date, sex, occupation, residential district, date of symptom onset (the self-reported date of symptoms such as fever, cough, or other respiratory symptoms), and date of confirmed diagnosis (the laboratory confirmation date of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the biosamples). A case was recorded as a health care worker if the patient reported working in a hospital or clinic. Waiver of informed consent for collection of epidemiological data from patients with COVID-19 was granted by the National Health Commission of China as part of the infectious disease outbreak investigation. All identifiable personal information was removed for privacy protection.\nCase Definitions\nCases were diagnosed and the severity status was categorized as mild, moderate, severe, or critical according to the Diagnosis and Treatment Scheme for COVID-19 released by the National Health Commission of China (details in the eMethods in the Supplement).14 A laboratory-confirmed case was defined if the patient had a positive result for SARS-CoV-2 virus by real-time reverse transcriptase\u2013polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay or high-throughput sequencing of nasal and pharyngeal swab specimens. Only laboratory-confirmed cases were included in primary analyses for the consistency of case definition throughout the periods. There were an additional 17\u202f365 cases of clinically diagnosed COVID-19 (ie, by symptom report and chest x-ray but without a positive RT-PCR result) in the data set. However, only clinically diagnosed cases were permitted for case tracking from February 9 through February 19, when testing became more broadly available, and only permitted for presumptive cases in Hubei Province. Furthermore, many of the cases were actually not new, but previous cases for which retrospective diagnoses were made based on medical records. Therefore, we only included laboratory-confirmed cases in our analyses for the consistency of case definition throughout the periods, as well as to be comparable to data in other areas outside Hubei Province. Consequently, the number of cases in the primary analysis was smaller than the officially reported number, although clinically diagnosed cases were included in a sensitivity analysis (outlined below).\nClassification of 5 Time Periods\nTo better reflect the dynamics of the COVID-19 epidemic and corresponding interventions, 5 periods were classified based on important dates that could affect the virus transmission in Wuhan (Figure 1). The time before January 10, 2020, the first date of Chunyun (massive migration for the Chinese Lunar New Year), was considered as the first period, when no COVID-19\u2013specific interventions were imposed. The second period was the Chunyun of January 10 to 22, 2020, when massive population movement occurred and was expected to accelerate the spread of COVID-19.15 No strong intervention was imposed during the Chunyun period; the first announcement of human-to-human transmission and infections in health care workers was made on January 20. During this period, hospitals started to be overcrowded with patients with fever or respiratory symptoms.\nDuring the third period, between January 23 and February 1, the local government first blocked all outbound transportation from the city and subsequently suspended public transit and banned all vehicular traffic within the city. Other social distancing measures were also implemented, including compulsory mask wearing in public places and cancellation of social gatherings. Due to a severe shortage of medical resources in this period, many confirmed or presumptive cases could not receive timely diagnosis and treatment and were self-quarantined at home. On February 2, with improvement in medical resources, the government implemented a policy of centralized quarantine and treatment of all confirmed and presumptive cases, those with fever or respiratory symptoms, and close contacts of confirmed cases in designated hospitals or facilities. Meanwhile, a stay-at-home policy was implemented for all residents in the city. On February 17, the government initiated door-to-door and individual-to-individual symptom screening for all residents with support from thousands of community workers.\nTaken together, the outbreak was divided into 5 periods: no intervention before January 10, massive human migration between January 10 and 22, city lockdown with traffic suspension and home quarantine between January 23 and February 1, intensified measures with centralized quarantine and treatment between February 2 and 16, and community universal symptom survey on and after February 17, 2020. Specific events and features are shown in Figure 1.\nOutcomes\nDaily rate of confirmed cases, defined as the number of laboratory-confirmed cases per day per million people, were estimated by patient age, sex, health care occupation, and residential district across periods. The calculation used the number of cases in each period divided by the number of days in each period (33, 13, 10, 15, and 21 days) and the subtotal population size in each stratum from the Wuhan Statistical Yearbook 2018. The effective reproduction number Rt, defined as the mean number of secondary cases generated by a typical primary case at time t in a population, was calculated as an indicator to measure the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 both before and after the interventions. Clinical severity information was extracted from the data set and was available for 32\u202f325 confirmed cases (258 cases had missing values and were not included in the clinical severity analyses).\nStatistical Analysis\nThe distribution of age, sex, and occupation in laboratory-confirmed cases was described, and the epidemic curve by the symptom onset date and important dates of interventions was plotted. A sensitivity analysis was also conducted to include the clinically diagnosed cases in the epidemic curve. The geographical distributions of daily rates of COVID-19 cases across Wuhan city through the 5 periods were presented using ArcGIS software version 10.6 (Environmental Systems Research Institute Inc). A modified Poisson regression with robust variance was used to evaluate the relationship between age, sex, time period, and health care occupation with disease severity (mild and moderate vs severe and critical).16 The 4 variables were included simultaneously and risk ratios (RRs) were reported along with 95% CIs. All statistical analyses were performed using SAS statistical software version 9.3 (SAS Institute Inc), and P values were 2-tailed with statistical significance set at .05.\nThe Rt was calculated using the method developed by Cori et al17 in R version 3.6.2 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing). The daily number of reported COVID-19 cases and the serial interval (mean, 7.5 days [SD, 3.4 days]; constant across periods), derived from a previous epidemiological survey of the first 425 cases in Wuhan,8 were used to estimate Rt and its 95% credible interval on each day via a 5-day moving average. The Rt was calculated for the whole period, but results were shown beginning with January 1, 2020, given the limited number of diagnosed cases and limited diagnosis capacity in December 2019.\nResults\nCharacteristics of Patients With COVID-19\nThe analyses included a total of 32\u202f583 confirmed cases, among whom 15\u202f766 (48.4%) were men and 16\u202f817 (51.6%) were women (Table). The median age of the patients was 56.7 years (range, 0-103; interquartile range, 43.4-66.8), with the majority (n\u2009=\u200924\u202f203, 74.3%) aged 40 to 79 years (Table).\nThe epidemic curve according to the symptom onset date and key interventions is shown in Figure 1. Most cases occurred between January 20 and February 6, with a spike on February 1. The epidemic curve with inclusion of clinically diagnosed cases is shown in eFigure 1 in the Supplement, and the epidemic curve limiting the sample to only severe and critical cases is shown in eFigure 2 in the Supplement; both showed similar patterns to the main analysis. There was a substantial delay between symptom onset date and laboratory confirmation date in the early periods, with the lag decreasing over time (median, 26, 15, 10, 6, and 3 days for the 5 periods, respectively; eFigure 3 in the Supplement).\nGeographic Spread and Confirmed Case Rates\nThe outbreak started from the urban districts and gradually spread to the suburban and rural areas across the 5 periods. There were strong geographic differences in rates of confirmed cases, with the highest rates in the urban districts (Figure 2).\nThe daily confirmed case rate per million people increased from 2.0 (95% CI, 1.8-2.1) before January 10, to 45.9 (95% CI, 44.6-47.1) between January 10 and 22, and to 162.6 (95% CI, 159.9-165.3) between January 23 and February 1, and then decreased to 77.9 (95% CI, 76.3-79.4) between February 2 and 16, and 17.2 (95% CI, 16.6-17.8) after February 16 (Figure 3A; eTable 1 in the Supplement). Similar patterns were observed for men and women, with a slightly higher rate in women (43.7 [95% CI, 43.0-44.4]) compared with men (39.4 [95% CI, 38.8-40.0]) over the whole period (Figure 3A).\nA total of 1496 local health care workers had confirmed cases, representing 4.6% of all cases (Table). The daily rate of cases in local health care workers (130.5 per million people [95% CI, 123.9-137.2]) was higher than that in the general population (41.5 per million people [95% CI, 41.0-41.9]) over the whole period. The rate among health care workers peaked in the third period (617.4 per million people [95% CI, 576.3-658.4]), but decreased in the last 2 periods when comprehensive personal protective equipment was more widely used (Figure 3A; eTable 1 in the Supplement).\nRates of confirmed cases and trends also differed by age. It peaked in the third period and declined thereafter for those older than 20 years, while it continued to increase for children and adolescents (age <20 years) (Figure 3B; eTable 1 in the Supplement), particularly for infants younger than 1 year (Figure 3C). The rate over the whole period among infants younger than 1 year was 7.9 per million people (95% CI, 5.8-10.0), while it ranged from 2.0 to 5.4 among other age groups of children and adolescents (Figure 3C; eTable 1 in the Supplement).\nClinical Severity of Disease\nConfirmed cases with available data (n\u2009=\u200932\u202f325) were classified into mild (n\u2009=\u200915\u202f531, 48.0%), moderate (n\u2009=\u20099655, 29.9%), severe (n\u2009=\u20096169, 19.1%), and critical (n\u2009=\u2009970, 3.0%) (Figure 3D). The proportion of severe and critical cases decreased gradually over time, accounting for 53.1%, 35.1%, 23.5%, 15.9%, and 10.3% of the classifiable cases in the 5 periods, respectively (Figure 3D).\nThe unadjusted proportion of severe and critical cases increased with age (4.10% in those aged <20 years, 12.1% in those aged 20-39 years, 17.4% in those aged 40-59 years, 29.6% in those aged 60-79 years, and 41.3% in those aged \u226580 years), and the corresponding multivariable-adjusted RRs (95% CIs) were 0.47 (0.31-0.70), 1.00 (reference), 1.41 (1.30-1.53), 2.33 (2.16-2.52), and 3.61 (3.31-3.95), respectively (eTable 2 in the Supplement).\nFemales were at lower risk of severe and critical disease than were males (unadjusted proportion, 20.6% vs 23.7%; adjusted RR, 0.90 [95% CI, 0.86-0.93]), while there were no significant differences in clinical severity between health care workers and other occupation groups (unadjusted proportion, 17.4% vs 22.3%; adjusted RR, 1.08 [95% CI, 0.96-1.21]).\nEstimates of Rt\nEstimates of the effective reproduction number Rt varied in the first period (Figure 4), gradually increased in the second period with a peak of 3.82 on January 24, and declined thereafter. The Rt fell below 1.0 on February 6, 2020, and further decreased to below 0.3 on March 1, 2020. The daily estimated values of Rt are shown in eTable 3 in the Supplement.\nDiscussion\nIn this cohort study, the number of incident COVID-19 cases, rates of confirmed cases, and Rt were reduced and the outbreak was under improved control in Wuhan after implementation of multifaceted public health measures (including but not limited to intensive intracity and intercity traffic restriction, social distancing measures, home confinement and centralized quarantine, and improvement of medical resources).\nAmong the 32\u202f583 confirmed COVID-19 cases, females had a higher rate of confirmed cases compared with males, but males were more likely to have severe or critical illness. This is consistent with previous reports from China suggesting a higher crude fatality rate among men compared with women (2.8% vs 1.7%),18,19 and another study in critically ill patients demonstrating that more men were affected (67%) than women (33%).20 Although the reasons for these differences are unknown, it is possible that men were more likely to be current smokers21 and had a higher proportion of comorbid conditions, which might worsen their prognosis. Also consistent with early reports, younger people were less likely to be affected,8,18,22 although the rate continued to increase in children and adolescents over time. Infants younger than 1 year had the highest rate of cases among children and adolescents. These results suggest that vigorous efforts should be made to protect and reduce transmission and symptom progression in vulnerable populations including both elderly people and young children.22,23\nThe rate of cases in health care workers was substantially higher than in the general population between January 11 and February 1, indicating a high risk of nosocomial infection. This might be due to lower awareness and inadequate use of personal protective equipment in the early periods in this study, and later a severe shortage of medical resources. The rate of confirmed cases among local health care workers quickly decreased in the later periods, after increasing awareness of and wider use of personal protective equipment, proper training, adequate hospital-level prevention and management, and support from more than 30\u202f000 health care workers from other provinces of China. Furthermore, none of the health care workers from other provinces were infected, supporting the importance of carefully protecting health care workers in the outbreak of a high transmissible infectious disease.24\nThe findings of this study may be valuable in the current efforts to combat the global pandemic of COVID-19. Many countries, regions, and communities have or will confront a surge in incident cases,1 similar to what happened in Wuhan in January. In Wuhan, vigorous and multifaceted measures of containment, mitigation, and suppression were temporally associated with improved control of the epidemic when there was neither effective drug nor vaccine. In a city with 10 million residents, mitigation measures, such as traffic restriction, cancellation of social gatherings, and home quarantine, were associated with a reduction in the degree of transmission. However, despite these interventions, the confirmed case rate continued to increase in the third period, perhaps in part due to shortages of pharmaceuticals and medical equipment and delayed diagnosis and access to medical treatment. Without rapid diagnosis, the risk of cross-infection in hospitals was high and patients likely continued to infect family members and close contacts. It has been reported that about 80% of the cluster transmission occurred in families in China.22\nWith the improvement of medical resources (designated hospitals and wards, use of personal protective equipment, increased testing capacity and accelerated reporting, and timely medical treatment) and increasing supply of health care workers, the Chinese government issued a centralized quarantine and treatment policy on February 2. All confirmed and presumptive cases, those with fever or respiratory symptoms, as well as close contacts of confirmed cases were allocated to designated hospitals or facilities. Centralized quarantine of patients and close contacts appears to have been associated with a reduction in in-hospital, household, and community transmission. Between February 16 and 18, the government further initiated a door-to-door and individual-to-individual universal symptom survey to single out presumptive cases in the community, which was associated with further reductions in the spread of COVID-19 in Wuhan.\nPrevious studies have reported varied R0 (range 1.40-6.49 with a mean of 3.28) for the COVID-19 outbreak due to different data sources, time periods, and statistical methods.25 Using the first 425 patients in Wuhan, an early study reported an R0 of 2.20 based on the growth rate of the epidemic curve and the serial interval,8 while a recent analysis based on a transmission network model reported an R0 of 3.58,26 similar to the current estimates in the first and second period. This study found that the implementation of public health interventions was associated with a reduction in Rt to below 1.0 on February 6 and to below 0.3 on March 1, which may have implications for global efforts to contain the pandemic more broadly.27\nLimitations\nThe study has several limitations. First, the Chinese government implemented multiple interventions at the same time or in a short timeframe to control the outbreak, and thus individual strategies could not be evaluated. In addition, the observational study design precludes causal inference. However, clinical trials were not feasible or ethical under such public health emergencies, and there are not yet data available to compare the experience in Wuhan with other outbreak areas pursuing different policies.\nSecond, data were extracted from the infectious disease reporting system, and no information was available for other epidemiological variables and clinical characteristics, such as incubation period, time to hospitalization, time to discharge, medical treatment strategies, and vital status. Cases occurring in the early days of a new period included infections that were acquired during the previous period, and thus there were lags for the interventions to take effect.\nThird, there were unexplained peaks in the epidemic curve, particularly a surge on February 1. Fourth, no data were available on the diagnostic testing pattern, ascertainment rate, and proportion of asymptomatic cases. The shortage of testing in the early periods suggests that ascertainment bias may in part explain the initially high proportion of severe and critical cases; testing was widely available in the fourth and fifth periods and these estimates may reflect a more accurate measure of disease severity. There were likely substantial proportions of undetected cases in Wuhan in early periods,9-11 and asymptomatic cases could be infectious to others.28-30 Further field investigations and serologic studies are needed to confirm the ascertainment rate and the effect of unascertained cases (asymptomatic cases or patients with mild symptoms who could recover without seeking medical care) on the epidemic course31,32; this represents an important area for future study.\nConclusions\nA series of multifaceted public health interventions was temporally associated with improved control of the COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan, China. These findings may inform public health policy in other countries and regions to combat the global pandemic of COVID-19.\nBack to top\nArticle Information\nCorresponding Authors: Tangchun Wu, MD, PhD (wut@tjmu.edu.cn), and Sheng Wei, MD, PhD (shengwei@hust.edu.cn), School of Public Health, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, 13 Hongkong Rd, Wuhan 430030, Hubei, China; and Xihong Lin, PhD, Department of Biostatistics, Harvard T.H.

Greater proportions of patients with cardiac injury required noninvasive mechanical ventilation (38 of 82 [46.3%] vs 13 of 334 [3.9%]; P\u2009<\u2009.001) or invasive mechanical ventilation (18 of 82 [22.0%] vs 14 of 334 [4.2%]; P\u2009<\u2009.001) than those without cardiac injury. Complications were more common in patients with cardiac injury than those without cardiac injury and included acute respiratory distress syndrome (48 of 82 [58.5%] vs 49 of 334 [14.7%]; P\u2009<\u2009.001), acute kidney injury (7 of 82 [8.5%] vs 1 of 334 [0.3%]; P\u2009<\u2009.001), electrolyte disturbances (13 of 82 [15.9%] vs 17 of 334 [5.1%]; P\u2009=\u2009.003), hypoproteinemia (11 of 82 [13.4%] vs 16 of 334 [4.8%]; P\u2009=\u2009.01), and coagulation disorders (6 of 82 [7.3%] vs 6 of 334 [1.8%]; P\u2009=\u2009.02). Patients with cardiac injury had higher mortality than those without cardiac injury (42 of 82 [51.2%] vs 15 of 334 [4.5%]; P\u2009<\u2009.001). In a Cox regression model, patients with vs those without cardiac injury were at a higher risk of death, both during the time from symptom onset (hazard ratio, 4.26 [95% CI, 1.92-9.49]) and from admission to end point (hazard ratio, 3.41 [95% CI, 1.62-7.16]).\nConclusions and Relevance  Cardiac injury is a common condition among hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in Wuhan, China, and it is associated with higher risk of in-hospital mortality.\nIntroduction\nSince December 2019, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has resulted in considerable morbidity and mortality in more than 30 countries worldwide. Recently, COVID-19\u2013associated clusters of severe respiratory illness have been independently associated with risk of mortality, and mounting evidence substantiates the presence of cardiac injury in patients with COVID-19.1,2 Although a recent study reported that 12% of patients had COVID-19\u2013associated acute cardiac injury,1 manifesting as an ejection fraction decline and troponin I elevation, and the American College of Cardiology clinical bulletin has highlighted the cardiac implications of COVID-19,3 the association between COVID-19\u2013associated cardiac injury and risk of mortality remains unclear. The present study therefore retrospectively analyzed data from a single center in Wuhan, China, to examine the potential association between cardiac injury and mortality among patients with COVID-19.\nMethods\nStudy Participants\nConsecutive patients admitted to Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 were included in this retrospective cohort study, which was conducted from January 20, 2020, to February 10, 2020. Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University, located in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, was assigned responsibility for the treatment of patients with severe COVID-19 by the Wuhan government. The patients with COVID-19 enrolled in this study were diagnosed according to World Health Organization interim guidance.4 The cases without cardiac biomarkers, including values of high-sensitivity troponin I (hs-TNI) and creatinine kinase\u2013myocardial band (CK-MB), were excluded.\nThis study was approved by the National Health Commission of China and the institutional review board at Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University (Wuhan, China). Written informed consent was waived by the ethics commission of the designated hospital for patients with emerging infectious diseases.\nData Collection\nThe demographic characteristics (age and sex), clinical data (symptoms, comorbidities, laboratory findings, treatments, complications, and outcomes), laboratory findings, and results of cardiac examinations (cardiac biomarkers and electrocardiography) for participants during hospitalization were collected from electronic medical records by 2 investigators (S.S. and B.S.). Cardiac biomarkers measured on admission were collected, including hs-TNI, CK-MB, and myohemoglobin. The radiologic assessments included chest radiography or computed tomography. All data were independently reviewed and entered into the computer database by 2 analysts (T.L. and Y.C.). Patients were categorized according to the presence or absence of cardiac injury. Cardiac injury was defined as blood levels of cardiac biomarkers (hs-TNI) above the 99th-percentile upper reference limit, regardless of new abnormalities in electrocardiography and echocardiography. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) was defined according to the Berlin definition.5 Acute kidney injury was identified according to the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes definition.6 The clinical outcomes (ie, discharges, mortality, and length of stay) were monitored up to February 15, 2020, the final date of follow-up.\nTo confirm COVID-19, the Viral Nucleic Acid Kit (Health) was used to extract nucleic acids from clinical samples according to the kit instructions. A 2019-nCoV detection kit (Bioperfectus) was used to detect the ORF1ab gene (nCovORF1ab) and the N gene (nCoV-NP) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions, using real-time reverse transcriptase\u2013polymerase chain reaction.7 An infection was considered laboratory-confirmed if the nCovORF1ab and nCoV-NP tests both showed positive results.\nStatistical Analysis\nDescriptive statistics were obtained for all study variables. All categorical variables were compared for the study outcome by using the Fisher exact test or \u03c72 test, and continuous variables were compared using the t test or the Mann-Whitney U test, as appropriate. Continuous data are expressed as mean (SD) or median (interquartile range [IQR]) values. Categorical data are expressed as proportions. Survival curves were plotted using the Kaplan-Meier method and compared between patients with vs without cardiac injury using the log-rank test. Multivariate Cox regression models were used to determine the independent risk factors for death during hospitalization. Data were analyzed using SPSS version 25.0 (IBM). Statistical charts were generated using Excel 2016 (Microsoft) or Prism 5 (Graphpad). For all the statistical analyses, P\u2009<\u2009.05 was considered significant.\nResults\nPatient Characteristics\nFigure 1 shows a flowchart for patient recruitment. Briefly, of all 1004 patients in the medical record system who were screened initially from January 20, 2020, to February 10, 2020, 218 patients whose cases were not confirmed, 141 patients without available medical information and duplicated records, and 229 patients with missing core results of laboratory examination (hs-TNI and CK-MB) were excluded. The median age of these 229 patients was 45 years (range, 22-90 years), and 130 (56.8%) were female; the details of baseline characteristics were presented in the eTable in the Supplement.\nFinally, the study population included 416 patients hospitalized with confirmed COVID-19: 82 patients (19.7%) with cardiac injury and 334 patients (80.3%) without cardiac injury. The median age was 64 years (range, 21-95 years), and 211 (50.7%) were female. Among these patients, fever (334 patients [80.3%]) was the most common symptom. Cough, shortness of breath, fatigue, sputum production, and muscle ache were present in 144 patients (34.6%), 117 patients (28.1%), 55 patients (13.2%), 23 patients (5.5%), and 19 patients (4.6%), respectively. Diarrhea (16 patients [3.8%]), chest pain (14 patients [3.4%]), sore throat (12 patients [2.9%]), rhinorrhea (10 patients [2.4%]), and headache (9 patients [2.2%]) were rare. Hypertension (127 patients [30.5%]) and diabetes (60 patients [14.4%]) were the most common coexisting conditions. Of these 416 patients, 44 (10.6%) and 22 (5.3%) had coronary heart disease and cerebrovascular disease, respectively. The proportion of chronic heart failure, chronic renal failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cancer, pregnancy, and hepatitis B infection was 4.1% (17 patients), 3.4% (14 patients), 2.9% (12 patients), 2.2% (9 patients), 1.7% (7 patients), and 1.0% (4 patients), respectively.\nCompared with patients without cardiac injury, patients with cardiac injury were older (median [range] age, 74 [34-95] years vs 60 [21-90] years; P\u2009<\u2009.001), and more likely to have chest pain (11 of 82 patients [13.4%] vs 3 of 334 patients [0.9%]; P\u2009<\u2009.001). Moreover, comorbidities, including hypertension (49 [59.8%] vs 78 [23.4%]), diabetes (20 [24.4%] vs 40 [12.0%]), coronary heart disease (24 [29.3%] vs 20 [6.0%]), cerebrovascular disease (13 [15.9%] vs 9 [2.7%]), chronic heart failure (12 [14.6%] vs 5 [1.5%]), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (6 [7.3%] vs 6 [1.8%]), and cancer (7 [8.5%] vs 2 [0.6%]), were present more often among patients with cardiac injury (all P\u2009<\u2009.001) (Table 1).\nLaboratory and Radiographic Findings\nThe laboratory and radiologic findings are shown in Table 1. In the overall study population of 416 patients, median (IQR) levels of C-reactive protein (4.5 [1.4-8.5] mg/dL; to convert to milligrams per liter, multiply by 10) and procalcitonin (0.07 [0.04-0.15] ng/L) were elevated, while the median values of other laboratory indicators were within the normal range, such as counts of leukocytes, lymphocytes, platelets, erythrocytes; hemoglobin level; cardiac indicators; alanine aminotransferase level; aspartate aminotransferase level; creatinine concentration; and electrolyte levels. The proportion of patietns with bilateral pneumonia was 74.8% (311 patients) according to chest radiography and computed tomography findings, and 68 patients (16.3%) had multiple mottling and ground-glass opacity. Distribution of hs-TNI based on detection time from hospitalization (median [IQR], 2 [1-15] days) is shown in eFigure 1 in the Supplement. The duration of hospitalization before testing was longer in patients with cardiac injury than those without cardiac injury (median [range] time, 3 [1-15] days vs 2 [1-8] days; P\u2009<\u2009.001).\nIn terms of laboratory findings, patients with cardiac injury compared with patients without cardiac injury showed higher median leukocyte count (median [IQR], 9400 [6900-13\u202f800] cells/\u03bcL vs 5500 [4200-7400] cells/\u03bcL), and levels of C-reactive protein (median [IQR], 10.2 [6.4-17.0] mg/dL vs 3.7 [1.0-7.3] mg/dL), procalcitonin (median [IQR], 0.27 [0.10-1.22] ng/mL vs 0.06 [0.03-0.10] ng/mL), CK-MB (median [IQR], 3.2 [1.8-6.2] ng/mL vs 0.9 [0.6-1.3] ng/mL), myohemoglobin (median [IQR], 128 [68-305] \u03bcg/L vs 39 [27-65] \u03bcg/L), hs-TNI (median [IQR], 0.19 [0.08-1.12] \u03bcg/L vs <0.006 [<0.006-0.009] \u03bcg/L), N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) (median [IQR], 1689 [698-3327] pg/mL vs 139 [51-335] pg/mL), aspartate aminotransferase (median [IQR], 40 [27-60] U/L vs 29 [21-40] U/L), and creatinine (median [IQR], 1.15 [0.72-1.92] mg/dL vs 0.64 [0.54-0.78] mg/dL) during hospitalization, but a lower median lymphocyte count (median [IQR], 600 [400-900] cells/\u03bcL vs 1000 [800-1400] cells/\u03bcL), platelet count (median [IQR], 172 [111-215] cells\u2009\u00d7\u2009103/\u03bcL vs 216 [165-273] cells\u2009\u00d7\u2009103/\u03bcL), and albumin level (median [IQR], 3.2 [2.9-3.4] g/dL vs 3.7 [3.3-3.9] g/dL), with significant differences in each case (all P\u2009<\u2009.001; Table 1; eFigure 1 in the Supplement). In terms of radiologic findings, bilateral pneumonia (75 of 82 patients [91.5%] vs 236 of 334 patients [70.7%]) and multiple mottling and ground-glass opacity (53 [64.6%] vs 15 [4.5%]) were more prevalent in patients with than those without cardiac injury (both P\u2009<\u2009.001, Table 1).\nOf patients with cardiac injury, only 22 (26.8%) underwent examination of electrocardiogram (ECG) after admission, and 14 of 22 ECGs (63.6%) were performed during the periods of elevation of cardiac biomarkers. All 14 ECGs were abnormal, with findings compatible with myocardial ischemia, such T-wave depression and inversion, ST-segment depression, and Q waves. The ECG changes in 3 patients with representative cardiac injury are shown in eFigure 2 in the Supplement.\nTreatment, Complications, and Clinical Outcome\nThe median time from symptom onset to admission was 10 (IQR, 1-30) days and similar between the 2 groups (P\u2009=\u2009.27; Table 2). A total of 399 patients (95.9%) were treated with oxygen, and the percentages of use of oxygen inhalation, noninvasive ventilation, and invasive mechanical ventilation were 76.0% (316 patients), 12.3% (51 patients), and 7.7% (32 patients), respectively. The proportion of antiviral therapy use was the highest (403 [96.9%]), followed by glucocorticoids (304 [73.1%]), intravenous immunoglobulin therapy (259 [62.3%]), and antibiotic therapy (235 [56.5%]). Only 2 patients (0.5%) among all participants were given continuous kidney therapy. Overall, 97 patients (23.3%) had ARDS, and 8 patients (1.9%) had acute kidney injury during hospitalization; other common complications included electrolyte disturbance (30 patients [7.2%]), hypoproteinemia (27 [6.5%]), anemia (13 [3.1%]), and coagulation disorders (12 [2.9%]). During follow-up, a total of 57 patients (13.7%) died, 40 patients (9.6%) were discharged, and the rest (319 [76.7%]) remained hospitalized. Compared with those without cardiac injury, patients with cardiac injury required more noninvasive ventilation (38 [46.3%] vs 13 [3.9%]; P\u2009<\u2009.001) and invasive mechanical ventilation (18 [22.0%] vs 14 [4.2%]; P\u2009<\u2009.001) (Table 2). The use of antibiotic treatment (68 [82.9%] vs 167 [50.0%]), glucocorticoids (72 [87.8%] vs 232 [69.5%]), and intravenous immunoglobulin treatment (68 [82.9%] vs 191 [57.2%]) was also significant higher in patients with cardiac injury than in those without cardiac injury (all P\u2009<\u2009.001; Table 2). In addition to anemia, other complications were more common among patients with cardiac injury than those without cardiac injury; these included ARDS (48 [58.5%] vs 49 [14.7%]; P\u2009<\u2009.001), acute kidney injury (7 [8.5%] vs 1 [0.3%]; P\u2009<\u2009.001), electrolyte disturbances (13 [15.9%] vs 17 [5.1%]; P\u2009=\u2009.003), hypoproteinemia (11 [13.4%] vs 16 [4.8%]; P\u2009=\u2009.01), and coagulation disorders (6 [7.3%] vs 6 [1.8%]; P\u2009=\u2009.02) (Table 2).\nCardiac Injury and Mortality\nPatients with cardiac injury vs those without cardiac injury had shorter durations from symptom onset to follow-up (mean, 15.6 [range, 1-37] days vs 16.9 [range, 3-37] days; P\u2009=\u2009.001) and admission to follow-up (6.3 [range, 1-16] days vs 7.8 [range, 1-23] days; P\u2009=\u2009.039). The mortality rate was higher among patients with vs without cardiac injury (42 [51.2%] vs 15 [4.5%]; P\u2009<\u2009.001) as shown in Table 2 and the Kaplan-Meier survival curves in Figure 2. The mortality rate increased in association with the magnitude of the reference value of hs-TNI (eFigure 3 in the Supplement). After adjusting for age, preexisting cardiovascular diseases (hypertension, coronary heart disease, and chronic heart failure), cerebrovascular diseases, diabetes mellitus, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, renal failure, cancer, ARDS, creatinine levels greater than 133 \u03bcmol/L, and NT-proBNP levels greater than 900 pg/mL, the multivariable adjusted Cox proportional hazard regression model showed a significantly higher risk of death in patients with cardiac injury than in those without cardiac injury, either during time from symptom onset (hazard ratio [HR], 4.26 [95% CI, 1.92-9.49]) or time from admission to study end point (HR, 3.41 [95% CI, 1.62-7.16]) (Table 3). Under this hazard regression model, ARDS was another independent risk factor for mortality with COVID-19, with a high HR (7.89 [95% CI, 3.73-16.66]) in model 1 and an HR of 7.11 (95% CI, 3.31-15.25) in model 2 (Table 3).\nDiscussion\nThe present study demonstrates the statistically significant association between cardiac injury and mortality in patients with COVID-19. Cardiac injury, as a common complication (19.7%), was associated with an unexpected high risk of mortality during hospitalization.\nAs of March 12, 2020, there have been a total of more than 130\u202f000 laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19 globally, including more than 80\u202f000 within mainland China. Because of its high infectivity, this virus has managed to supersede severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) in death toll. Severe respiratory distress is usually considered the main cause of coronavirus-induced death. According to a recent study of the largest clinical sample in China,8 severe pneumonia was independently associated with admission to an intensive care unit, mechanical ventilation, or death. It is notable that a recent report on 138 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 found that 7.2% of patients developed acute cardiac injury, and patients who received care in the intensive care unit were more likely to have cardiac injury (22.2%) than non-ICU patients.2 This observation suggests that cardiac injury is possibly associated with the clinical outcomes of COVID-19. Consistently, our study also found 19.7% of patients with cardiac injury and first demonstrated that cardiac injury was independently associated with an increased risk of mortality in patients with COVID-19. Compared with patients without cardiac injury, patients with cardiac injury presented with more severe acute illness, manifested by abnormal laboratory and radiographic findings, such as higher levels of C-reactive protein, NT-proBNP, and creatinine levels; more multiple mottling and ground-glass opacity; and a greater proportion requiring noninvasive or invasive ventilation.\nIn a study of cardiovascular complications of SARS in 121 patients,9 hypertension occurred in 61 patients (50.4%) in the hospital. Of these patients, 71.9% developed persistent tachycardia, including 40% with continued tachycardia during outpatient follow-up. Although tachycardic cardiovascular complications were common in patients with SARS, they were usually self-limiting and not associated with risk of death. In contrast with that from SARS, more than half of the patients with cardiac injury experienced in-hospital death in this study, indicating that COVID-19\u2013induced cardiac injury is associated with major adverse clinical outcomes. However, the mechanism of cardiac injury among these patients with COVID-19 remains uncertain.\nEvidence from a case report showed that MERS-CoV causes acute myocarditis, manifested as myocardial edema and acute myocardial injury of the apical and lateral walls of the left ventricle.10 This regional myocardial injury may result from direct viral myocardial infection. On the basis of recent studies, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is a human cell receptor with a strong binding affinity to the Spike protein of SARS-CoV-2, and ACE2 is also highly expressed in heart.11,12 Thus, it is rational to hypothesize that COVID-19\u2013induced cardiac injury might be mediated by ACE2. However, a recent pathological study found scarce interstitial mononuclear inflammatory infiltrates in heart tissue without substantial myocardial damage in a patient with COVID-19,13 suggesting that COVID-19 might not directly impair the heart. The present study lacks evidence from magnetic resonance imaging or echocardiography to determine the features of myocardial injury. On the basis of the present results of hs-TNI and ECG findings in a subset of patients, we can only estimate the severity of cardiac injury. Thus, because of the current limited evidence, the question of whether the SARS-CoV-2 virus can directly injure the heart requires further demonstration.\nIn contrast, a previous study found that reversible, subclinical diastolic left ventricular impairment appears to be common in acute SARS infection, even among those without underlying cardiac disease,14 suggesting that left ventricular dysfunction in the acute phase might be attributable to the cytokine storm syndrome. This is a serious life-threatening disease with clinical features of systemic inflammation, methemoglobinemia, hemodynamic instability, and multiple organ failure.15,16 The hallmark of cytokine storm syndrome is an uncontrolled and dysfunctional immune response involving the continuous activation and proliferation of lymphocytes and macrophages. Huang et al1 found that patients with COVID-19 who were admitted to the intensive care unit had higher plasma levels of cytokines, including interleukin (IL)\u20132, IL-7, IL-10, granulocyte-colony stimulating factor, IgG-induced protein 10 (also known as C-X-C motif chemokine 10), monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, macrophage inflammatory protein 1-alpha (also known as chemokine ligand 3), and tumor necrosis factor \u03b1. In the present study, we also found that markers of inflammatory response, such as C-reactive protein, procalcitonin, and leukocytes, were significantly increased among patients who suffered from cardiac injury. The activation or enhanced release of these inflammatory cytokines can lead to apoptosis or necrosis of myocardial cells.\nIn addition, preexisting cardiovascular diseases might also be more susceptible COVID-19\u2013induced heart injury, as approximately 30% and 60% of patients with cardiac injury in the present study had a history of coronary heart disease and hypertension, respectively, which were significantly more prevalent than in those without cardiac injury. Similarly, in a recent report,2 25% and 58.3% of patients who were critically ill with COVID-19 had underlying heart diseases and hypertension, respectively. According to the \u201cDiagnosis and Treatment of Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia (Trial Version 4),\u201d17 elderly patients with underlying diseases are more likely to be infected with SARS-CoV-2 and tend to be severely ill, especially those with hypertension, coronary heart disease, and diabetes. Although there are few pieces of evidence to establish a direct association between cardiac injury and cardiovascular comorbidities, it is rational to presume that patients with coronary artery disease or heart failure are susceptible to cardiac injury, and once such patients are infected with severe pneumonia, myocardial ischemia or cardiac dysfunction are more likely to occur, ultimately leading to a sudden deterioration. On the other hand, acute inflammatory responses can also lead to ischemia in the presence of preexisting cardiovascular diseases. The inflammatory activity within coronary atherosclerotic plaques is exacerbated during systemic inflammatory response, making them prone to rupture.18 Inflammation also causes endothelial dysfunction and increases the procoagulant activity of the blood, which can contribute to the formation of an occlusive thrombus over a ruptured coronary plaque.19 Based on these lines of evidence, we hypothesize that an intense inflammatory response superimposed on preexisting cardiovascular disease may precipitate cardiac injury observed in patients with COVID-19 infections.\nLimitations\nSome limitations existed in the present study. First, because of the logistical limitations at the onset of these emerging infections in Wuhan, some data, such as echocardiography data, electrocardiography data, and cytokine level measurements, were lacking from clinical examinations of patients in isolation wards or the intensive care unit, which limits the determination of potential mechanisms of cardiac injury. Second, because the clinical observation of patients is still ongoing, many with and without cardiac injury have not reached clinical end points. Third, data from larger populations and multiple centers are warranted to further confirm the outcomes of cardiac injury in COVID-19.\nConclusions\nCardiac injury is a common condition among patients hospitalized with COVID-19, and it is associated with a higher risk of in-hospital mortality. Although the exact mechanism of cardiac injury needs to be further explored, the findings presented here highlight the need to consider this complication in COVID-19 management.\nBack to top\nArticle Information\nAccepted for Publication: March 9, 2020.\nCorresponding Author: Bo Yang, MD, PhD (yybb112@whu.edu.cn), and He Huang, MD, PhD (huanghe1977@whu.edu.cn), Cardiovascular Research Institute, Department of Cardiology, Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University, 238 Jiefang Rd, Wuchang District, Wuhan 430060, Hubei, China.\nPublished Online: March 25, 2020. doi:10.1001/jamacardio.2020.0950\nAuthor Contributions: Drs B.

Ultimately, more than 8000 people became ill during the SARS epidemic, and about 10% of them died.\nBut this time around, public health authorities and researchers were primed to respond more rapidly to contain the potential threat. Public health authorities in the affected areas and international agencies have been sharing information about the outbreak with one another and the public, and researchers around the world have also been pulling together, sharing samples and other findings.\n(Photo credit: NIAID)\nThe identification of a novel coronavirus in humans in the Middle East and the United Kingdom has triggered concern.\nAlarm bells go off\nThe similarities between the newly identified coronavirus and SARS, as well as the apparently high mortality rate associated with the new virus, triggered immediate concern from public health authorities, according to Miles W. Carroll, PhD, of the UK Health Protection Agency.\n\u201cRespiratory pathogens are much more concerning because of the route of transmission,\u201d said Carroll.\nAt press time, there had been 14 laboratory-confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus and 8 deaths, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Most of the cases were identified on the Arabian Peninsula, but 3 of them were in the United Kingdom. Person-to-person transmission has been documented both in the United Kingdom and Jordan, according to Carroll. In the United Kingdom, the index patient was an individual who developed a severe respiratory illness before his return to the United Kingdom after a trip to Saudi Arabia and Pakistan. Subsequently, 2 contacts of this individual became ill, according to a report from the CDC (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm62e0307a1.htm?s_cid=mm62e0307a1_e). One developed a mild illness and recovered; the other had a preexisting medical condition and died after developing a severe respiratory infection.\nCarroll noted that there is also evidence of human-to-human transmission leading to 2 deaths in a hospital in Jordan that occurred before the pathogen had been identified. He explained that samples from 2 deceased patients indicated possible spread within the hospital.\n\u201cWe don't want to alarm people too much,\u201d he said. He noted that the virus does not spread very easily from person to person but rather requires close contact as you would see between individuals living together. However, clinicians and public health authorities must be vigilant because the virus could mutate in a way that makes human-to-human spread easier.\nThe CDC has updated its recommendations for clinicians (http://emergency.cdc.gov/HAN/han00343.asp) emphasizing the need to consider the novel coronavirus when treating patients with a severe respiratory illness who have recently traveled to the Arabian Peninsula or who are close contacts of those who have traveled to this region. Suspect cases should be reported to state and local public health authorities, who should then pass the information along to the CDC, according to the recommendations.\nRapid response\nIn the meantime, virologists around the world are working together to identify the source of the virus and ways to prevent or treat related illness.\nVincent Munster, PhD, head of the Virus Ecology Unit at the National Institutes of Health Rocky Mountain Laboratories in Hamilton, Montana, and his colleagues have already begun studies of animals infected with the virus. He said there has been a great deal of cooperation, with researchers rapidly disseminating genetic information about the virus, tools for diagnosing the infection, and isolates of the virus to colleagues around the world. He attributed this openness to recognition that international collaboration is crucial in the aftermath of SARS. As a result of this openness, Munster and his colleagues were able to quickly acquire samples of the virus to begin studying it.\nMunster explained that initial attempts by his group to use hamsters as a model failed, and the group has instead had to use nonhuman primates. So far, the infected animals have developed mild to moderate respiratory illness, and none has died. His team hopes to be able to test potential treatments and preventive measures, such as prophylaxis or vaccines. As a specialist in virus ecology, Munster is also interested in understanding the evolution of this virus and how it came to infect humans. Palm civets, a small Asian mammal, acted as a reservoir for the SARS virus. The animal reservoir for the newly identified coronavirus was unknown at press time; however, Munster noted that the virus is closely related to coronaviruses that infect bats.\nMunster said it has been interesting to see how quickly the new virus spread from the Middle East to the United Kingdom.\n\u201cIt's important that we keep a focus on what's going on in the world,\u201d he said.\nThis article was corrected for errors on May 14, 2013.", "jama.2012.31393": "MMWR. 2012;40:820.\nCDC is working closely with the World Health Organization (WHO) and other partners to better understand the public health risk presented by a recently detected, novel coronavirus. This virus has been identified in two patients, both previously healthy adults who suffered severe respiratory illness.1,2 The first patient, a man aged 60 years from Saudi Arabia, was hospitalized in June 2012 and died; the second patient, a man aged 49 years from Qatar with onset of symptoms in September 2012 was transported to the United Kingdom for intensive care. He remains hospitalized on life support with both pulmonary and renal failure.3,4 Person-to-person or health-care\u2013associated transmission has not been identified to date.5 Interim case definitions based on acute respiratory illness and travel history were issued by WHO on September 29 and include criteria for \u201cpatient under investigation,\u201d \u201cprobable case,\u201d and \u201cconfirmed case.\u201d6 This information is current as of October 4. Updates on the investigation and the WHO case definition are available at http://www.who.int/csr/don/en/index.html.\nCoronaviruses are a large, diverse group of viruses that affect many animal species. A few of these viruses cause a wide range of respiratory illness in humans, typically with \u201ccommon cold\u201d symptoms. Genetic sequence data indicate that this new virus is a beta-coronavirus similar to bat coronaviruses, but not similar to any other coronavirus previously described in humans, including the coronavirus that caused severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS).1 Comparison of viral genetic sequences from the two patients indicated that the two viruses are closely related. Treatment is supportive because no specific therapy has been shown to be effective.\nWHO and CDC have not issued any travel alerts at this time. The risk to U.S. residents traveling in the region currently is estimated to be low. For persons traveling to Saudi Arabia to participate in the Hajj, scheduled for October 24-29, 2012, requirements and recommendations remain unchanged and can be found at http://www.cdc.gov/features/Hajj.\nPersons who develop acute respiratory illness within 10 days after returning from Saudi Arabia or Qatar (excluding persons who only passed through airports) should consult a physician and mention their recent travel. Persons with acute severe lower respiratory illness requiring hospitalization should be evaluated using the guidance at the CDC coronavirus website (http://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/ncv), which is based on the WHO case definition. Persons whose respiratory illness remains unexplained and who meet the WHO criteria for \u201cpatient under investigation\u201d should be reported immediately to CDC through state and local health departments. At present, testing of specimens for the novel coronavirus will be conducted by CDC; widely available diagnostic tests for coronaviruses are not suitable for detecting this new virus.\nRecommendations and guidance on the case definitions, infection control including personal protective equipment, case investigation, and specimen collection and shipment, are available at the CDC coronavirus website. Because of the possibility of frequent updates as new information becomes available, readers are encouraged to consult the CDC coronavirus website for current information.

A diagnosis of SARS was based on the demonstration of serum coronavirus antibodies. Clinical presentations, laboratory results, electrophysiologic findings, and follow-up conditions were determined.\nResults  Patients developed neuromuscular problems approximately 3 weeks after the onset of SARS. Two women experienced motor-predominant peripheral nerve disorders. A man developed myopathy and a third woman experienced neuropathy and myopathy. Cerebrospinal fluid obtained from 2 patients with neuropathy disclosed normal protein content and the absence of pleocytosis and SARS coronavirus antibodies. Both patients with myopathy had elevated serum creatine kinase levels. A rapid clinical and electrophysiologic improvement was evident during follow-up examinations, with a good prognosis.\nConclusions  The neuromuscular problems in patients with SARS are considered to be critical-illness polyneuropathy or myopathy, possibly coexistent. Further pathological and microbiological studies are necessary to determine the relationship between SARS coronavirus and neuromuscular problems.\nIn the worldwide outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) from 2002 to 2003, 664 patients likely contracted the illness in Taiwan alone.1 Patients with SARS usually present with fever, nonproductive cough, dyspnea, generalized malaise, and diarrhea.2-4 Neurologic manifestations have rarely been described, and the relationship, if any, between the causative coronavirus and neuromuscular problems is still unknown.5\nSuch a relationship is entirely conceivable. A viral infection may cause neuromuscular disorders in different ways, including direct attacks in the form of viral neuritis or myositis, inflammatory reaction through immune mimicry, or as a part of systemic inflammatory response syndrome.6,7\nIn this report, we describe 4 patients with probable SARS who developed peripheral nerve and/or muscle problems after the onset of the illness. The clinical presentations, electrophysiologic findings, and follow-up conditions of their neuromuscular disorders were delineated andclarified.\nMethods\nPatients\nBetween March 3 and June 15, 2003, a total of 76 patients whose disease met the diagnostic criteria for probable SARS as defined by the World Health Organization8 were under treatment at the National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei. Among them, 4 patients were referred to neurologists to evaluate weakness. The group consisted of 1 man and 3 women. Their mean age was 46 years.\nThe patients\u2019 medical records were reviewed with special attention to their clinical presentations, laboratory findings, radiologic results, and clinical courses. Table 1 shows the clinical data and SARS-related therapy in these 4 patients. Multiple organ failure was defined according to published criteria.9 The patients were positive for serum coronavirus antibodies with or without the corresponding reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction identification of the coronavirus from serum or throat swabs.\nThe administered medications included ribavirin, high-dose methylprednisolone, and intravenous immunoglobulin, in accordance with the standard treatment protocol.10\nThere was no history of any major medical problem such as diabetes mellitus or uremia, nor any symptoms suggestive of neuromuscular disorders before the development of SARS. Symptoms indicative of neuromuscular abnormality developed in each patient approximately 3 weeks after the onset of SARS. The clinical features of the first patient who developed neuromuscular problems (patient 1 in the present series) have been described elsewhere.5\nNeurologic and laboratory investigations\nEach patient was examined by at least 2 neurologists. All 4 patients were conscious, lucid, and cooperative during the examinations. We also focused on the serum creatine kinase (CK) levels of these patients during their full course of SARS (normal CK levels are <190 and 150 U/L for men and women, respectively). Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was obtained by lumbar puncture from patients 2 and 3 for measurements of pressure, cell count, total protein level, glucose level, and coronavirus antibody. The presence of bacteria was determined by application of gram stain and via bacterial culture. The course of each patient was followed up clinically and electrophysiologically for 3 weeks to 2 months.\nRoutine nerve conduction studies (NCSs) were performed with an electromyograph (Viking IV; Nicolet Biomedical, Madison, Wis). Motor NCSs, including F wave, were carried out on bilateral median, ulnar, peroneal, and tibial nerves. Sensory NCSs were carried out on the median, ulnar, and sural nerves. All patients underwent needle electromyography (EMG) studies.\nResults\nNeuromuscular manifestations and electrophysiologic findings are shown in Table 1 and Table 2, respectively.\nPatient 1\nComplete clinical information of this patient has been reported elsewhere.5 Only the main clinical and laboratory findings are included in Table 1 and Table 2.\nPatient 2\nA 48-year-old woman developed a fever and myalgia on May 11, 2003 (day 1). On day 12, she was intubated in response to respiratory distress. After extubation on day 24, she experienced weakness in 4 limbs and numbness in her fingers bilaterally. A neurologic examination on day 39 showed distal-predominant weakness of 4 limbs, minimally more severe on the left side. Muscle power as graded with the Medical Research Council scale was 4 to 5 in the proximal parts of the limbs and 3 to 4 in the distal parts of the limbs. Deep tendon reflexes (DTRs) were mildly decreased, with bilateral flexor plantar responses. There was hypesthesia to temperature and vibration below the knees. Other neurologic examination results were unremarkable.\nNerve conduction studies conducted on day 43 showed decreased amplitudes of compound muscle action potential (CMAP) in bilateral peroneal nerves. Other NCS findings were within normal limits. A needle EMG study in the right tibialis anterior muscle detected mildly decreased recruitment with abundant spontaneous activities (positive waves) and large polyphasic waves. Inview of the clinical features and electrophysiologic findings, axonopathic sensorimotor polyneuropathy wasdiagnosed.\nThe patient underwent a lumbar puncture on day 44. The opening pressure was 17.5 cm H2O. The CSF was clear in appearance with zero cell count, a total protein level of 46 mg/dL, and a glucose concentration of 68 mg/dL (3.77 mmol/L). Negative results were obtained for coronavirus antibody determination and bacteria.\nA follow-up neurologic examination 7 weeks after the first neurologic evaluation (day 92) showed nearly full muscle power in the proximal parts of the limbs and power of grade 4 to 5 in the distal parts of the limbs. Follow-up NCSs showed a generalized increase of the CMAP amplitudes.\nPatient 3\nA 42-year-old woman developed a fever on May 10, 2003 (day 1), and received intubation on day 14 for respiratory failure. She displayed weakness in 4 limbs on day 25. Serial serum examinations showed marked elevation of the CK level from 161 U/L (day 23) to a peak of 9050 U/L (day 26). The serum myoglobin level determined on day 28 was 2136 \u03bcg/L (122.0 nmol/L), which was markedly elevated from the normal value of less than 70 \u03bcg/L (4.0 nmol/L). In addition, numbness of the left foot was noted after extubation on day 31. On examination on day 45, the patient displayed weakness in 4 limbs, more severe on the left side. The Medical Research Council\u2013rated muscle power was 4 to 5 in the proximal parts of the upper limbs, 3 to 4 in the distal parts of the upper limbs, 2 to 3 in the proximal parts of the lower limbs, and 1 to 2 in the distal parts of the lower limbs. The DTRs were hypoactive in the proximal parts of the limbs but normal in the distal parts. Sensory examination showed hypesthesia to temperature, pinprick, and vibration below the left knee and the right midshin. The results of other neurologic examinations were unremarkable.\nNerve conduction studies conducted on day 48 showed decreased amplitudes of CMAP in bilateral peroneal nerves. The CMAP on the left tibial nerve was absent. Amplitudes of sensory action potential in plantar nerves were 6.4 \u03bcV on the right side and 3.0 \u03bcV on the left side. F waves were absent in the left leg and poorly elicited on the right peroneal nerve. Other NCS results were within reference ranges. Needle EMG in the left vastus lateralis, tibialis anterior, and gastrocnemius muscles showed early recruitment with spontaneous activities of fibrillations and positive waves. There was an increase in polyphasia. In view of the clinical presentations, we diagnosed myopathy with superimposed asymmetric sensorimotor polyneuropathy of axonopathic type.\nThe patient underwent a lumbar puncture on day 49. The opening pressure was 11.5 cm H2O. The CSF was clear in appearance with zero cell count, a total protein level of 15 mg/dL, and a glucose concentration of 73 mg/dL (4.05 mmol/L). Negative results were obtained for coronavirus antibody determination, gram stain, and bacterial culture.\nThree weeks after the initial neurologic evaluation (day 70), the muscle power had improved, with, for example, a recovery to grade 3 to 4 in the distal part of the legs. There were no significant changes in hypoactive DTRs or sensory deficits. A follow-up NCS demonstrated the return of CMAP amplitudes and F-waves in the left leg. The CMAP amplitudes in median nerves decreased in the follow-up NCS. However, this electrophysiologic deterioration did not parallel the great improvement in the patient\u2019s muscle power. The patient reported continuous improvement in muscle power in 4 limbs, but no improvement in the sensory problems, in a telephone interview conducted on day 87.\nPatient 4\nA 31-year-old man developed a fever and cough on May 11, 2003 (day 1). He did not undergo intubation. On day 22, he developed weakness and muscle aches in the proximal parts of both legs. He did not complain of any sensory symptoms. The serum CK level on day 21 was 366 U/L. Examination on day 45 showed mild weakness (grade 4-5) of the hip flexor muscles bilaterally. Other neurologic examination results were unremarkable.\nNeedle EMG (day 45) in the right iliopsoas and vastus medialis muscles showed normal recruitment with active spontaneous activities (fibrillations and positive waves) and abundant brief small polyphasic waves. The NCS findings were normal. Myopathy was diagnosed. A follow-up neurologic examination 7 weeks after the initial neurologic evaluation (day 94) showed full muscle power. Follow-up NCSs did not disclose any electrophysiologic changes.\nComment\nThe present report documents neuromuscular disorders in 4 patients with probable SARS. Patients 1 and 2 experienced sensorimotor peripheral nerve disorders. Patient 3 developed both myopathy and neuropathy. Patient 4 had only mild myopathy.\nThese neuromuscular disorders were not temporally coincident with the onset of SARS. Rather, symptoms appeared some 3 weeks later. Patients 1, 2, and 3 developed sensorimotor peripheral nerve disorders 21 to 25 days after the onset of SARS. Patients 2 and 3 exhibited weakness in all 4 limbs with slight asymmetry. The DTRs were mildly decreased. All 4 patients had sensory deficits that manifested as distal limb paresthesia and hypesthesia. Asymmetry in sensory problems was noted in patient 3. The NCSs disclosed reduced CMAP amplitudes, which proved to be temporary. There was no slowing of nerve conduction velocity, prolonged distal motor latency, conduction block, or temporal dispersion. The EMG showed acute denervation with increased polyphasia. These findings are consistent with motor-predominant axonal polyneuropathy or polyradiculoneuropathy.\nPatients 1, 2, and 3 received intensive care for multiple organ failure. In such a situation, combined with the clinical and electrophysiologic findings, a diagnosis of critical-illness polyneuropathy (CIP) is likely. Factors mediating systemic inflammatory response syndrome are also recognized as possibly being responsible for causing CIP.7 Systemic inflammatory response syndrome may occur in response to severe infection or trauma of any type.11 Therefore, the peripheral nerve disorder in our patients can be considered to be CIP caused by SARS-related systemic inflammatory response syndrome.\nAxonal Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome or acute motor sensory axonal neuropathy should also be taken into consideration.12 However, the observed normal protein levels in the CSF, relative preservation of DTRs as compared with the severity of muscle weakness, and rapid clinical as well as electrophysiologic improvement in these 4 patients do not favor a diagnosis of axonal Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome.12,13\nSome viruses, such as cytomegalovirus and varicella zoster virus, may cause peripheral neuropathy through direct attacks on the nerves.6 Whether such a mechanism exists in SARS-related neuropathy is unknown. Presently, a viral link to the observed neuropathy is not favored, in the absence of detectable antibodies to the SARS coronavirus in the CSF of patients 2 and 3. Further investigations including pathological and microbiological studies are necessary to delineate this issue.\nPatients 3 and 4 developed acute myopathy 25 and 22 days after the onset of SARS, respectively. Both patients had clinical, biochemical, and EMG evidence of myopathy. However, differences were evident between these 2 patients. Patient 3 developed severe weakness of all 4 limbs, whilepatient 4 developed only mild weakness in his bilateral hip flexor muscles. Patient 3 also developed concomitant peripheral neuropathy, which was not seen in patient 4. Patient 3 had rhabdomyolysis, while patient 4 had only mildly elevated serum CK levels. We observed more frank rhabdomyolysis in 2 other patients who had probable SARS in our hospital. Their conditions were accompanied by markedly elevated serum CK levels, which peaked at 339 750 and 7659 U/L.14 Unfortunately, these patients died of multiple organ failure before detailed neurologic investigation could be performed.Therefore, myopathic manifestations of SARS seem to vary from mild weakness in the proximal parts of the legs to frank rhabdomyolysis.\nHigh-dose intravenous corticosteroid therapy, which was applied in patients 3 and 4, may yield acute steroid myopathy (critical-illness myopathy [CIM]).15 Clinical and electrophysiologic features in the 2 patients were compatiblewith CIM.16,17 Coexistence of CIM and CIP, as in patient 3 in our series, has also been reported.11,18 To prevent CIM, it has been suggested that corticosteroid therapy be avoided.17 Current standard treatment with high-dose methylprednisolone for SARS might thus be in need of reassessment.\nThe coronavirus group is a diverse group of large enveloped RNA viruses that can cause respiratory and enteric diseases in humans and other animals.19 Among the coronavirus-induced animal diseases, infection with feline infectious peritonitis virus, mouse hepatitis virus, and hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus can be complicated by encephalitis.19,20 Direct attack on the peripheral nerves or muscles by the SARS virus may therefore be possible. Further investigations into the relationship between SARS and neuromuscular problems are necessary.\nIn conclusion, we have presented data from 4 patients with probable SARS who developed axonal polyneuropathy, myopathy, or both. The neuromuscular disorders developed approximately 3 weeks after the onset of SARS, and the prognosis was good. The most likely diagnoses are CIP and/or CIM.\nBack to top\nArticle Information\nCorrespondence: Yang-Chyuan Chang, MD, Department of Neurology, National Taiwan University Hospital, No. 7 Chung-Shan South Rd, Taipei 100, Taiwan, ROC (ycchang@ha.mc.ntu.edu.tw).\nAccepted for Publication: February 24, 2004.\nAuthor Contributions:Study concept and design: Tsai, Hsieh, S.-C.

Small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) are double-stranded RNAs that direct sequence-specific degradation of messenger RNA in mammalian cells.4 It is also possible, however, that siRNAs could specifically interfere with viral RNA.\nMethods\nMethods\nWe designed six 21-mer SARSis (siRNAs [GENSET SA Ltd, Paris, France] targeting different sites of the replicase 1A region of the SARS coronavirus [SARS-CoV] genome; siRNA sequences in the senses strands: GUGAACUCACUCGUGAGCUCdTdT [SARSi-1]; GUACCCUCUUGAUUGCAUCdTdT [SARSi-2]; GAGUCGAAGAGAGGUGUCUdTdT [SARSi-3]; GCACUUGUCUACCUUGAUGdTdT [SARSi-4]; CCUCCAGAUGAGGAAGAAGdTdT [SARSi-5]; and GGUGUUUCCAUUCCAUGUGdTdT [SARSi-6]). We then performed 3 in vitro experiments to test their antiviral effects. In the first, we transfected monkey kidney cells (FRhk-4) with 1 of the 6 siRNAs. In addition to these 6 groups of cells, we also created 2 groups of control cells\u20141 transfected with an unrelated siRNA targeting luciferase (GL2i),5 and the other with the medium. OligoFectamine (Invitrogen Corp, Carlsbad, Calif) was the transfection reagent. All groups of cells were incubated for 8 hours before infection with SARS virus GZ50 strain. Thirty-six hours after viral infection, cytopathic effects were judged with phase-contrast microscopy. The cells were then fixed with \u201320\u00b0C ethanol for 10 minutes and immunostained with a SARS-CoV\u2013specific antibody isolated from acute covalent sera of confirmed SARS patients. The coronavirus antigens were detected by indirect immunofluorescence assay using a fluoroscein isothiocyanate\u2013coagulated antibody1,2 (Inova Diagnostic Inc, San Diego, Calif). To quantify the viral genomic RNA, real-time polymerase chain reaction was performed as described previously.2\nMethods\nIn the second experiment, we transfected FRhk-4 cells with a combination of 2 or 3 SARSis (SARSi-2/3, SARSi-2/4, SARSi-3/4, SARSi-1/2/4, and SARSi-2/3/4), using GL2i as a control. In each combination, an equal amount of individual siRNA was used while the final concentration of total siRNAs remained the same (10 nM).\nMethods\nIn the third experiment, we tested the inhibitory effect of SARSi-2/3/4 on the infection and replication of 3 other SARS-CoV strains isolated from SARS patients in Hong Kong and Guan Zhou (GZ34, HKR1, and HKR2 strains).\nResults\nResults\nCompared with uninfected cells, cells infected with SARS-CoV exhibited a marked morphologic change with cytopathic effects (Figure 1). The uninfected cells were flattened, whereas the SARS-CoV infected cells became refractile and rounded. Judged by morphologic changes, SARSi-2, SARSi-3, and SARSi-4 markedly inhibited the cytopathic effects caused by viral infection and replication, whereas SARSi-1, SARSi-5, and SARSi-6 were less effective. The results were further confirmed by immunostaining with antibody against SARS-CoV antigens. There was a consistent and marked 92.5%, 89.6%, and 85.8% reduction in the viral genomic RNA copies (as determined by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction) in cells transfected by SARSi-4, SARSi-2, and SARSi-3, respectively. The reduction was much less marked in cells transfected by the other 3 siRNAs (only 50%-65%).\nFigure.\nInhibition of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS)-Associated Coronavirus Infection and Replication\nMonkey kidney cells (Frhk-4) were uninfected or were infected with SARS-associated coronavirus and transfected either without or with 1 of 6 SARSis (ie, small interfering RNAs targeting different sites of the replicase 1A region of the SARS coronavirus genome). Photographs were taken under both a phase-contrast microscope (left panels; orange coloration due to filtration for better contrast; magnification, \u00d7400) to show cytopathic effects , as well as a fluorescence microscope (right panels; magnification, \u00d7400) to show coronavirus antigen expression after immunostaining.\nResults\nIn the second experiment, the combinations of SARSi-2, SARSi-3, and SARSi-4 also inhibited the infection and replication of different strains of SARS-CoV. No obvious synergistic effects were observed, however, from any of these combinations.\nResults\nIn the third experiment, we found that the efficacy of SARSi-2, SARSi-3, or SARSi-4 in inhibiting the infection and replication of the 3 other SARS-CoV strains were similar to that of the GZ50 strain. Transfection with SARSi alone or GL2i did not show any change in cell morphology or viral genomic RNA copies (data not shown).\nComment\nComment\nsiRNAs targeting the replicase 1A region of the SARS-CoV genome appear to be effective in vitro against the SARS virus. Their clinical usefulness, however, has yet to be demonstrated.\nComment\nFunding/Support: This research was supported by a University Grants Committee seed grant (Drs He and Kung), Competitive Earmarked Research and Area of Excellence grants (Dr Kung) from the Research Grant Council, and a grant from the Innovation and Technology Fund (Dr Lin).\nAcknowledgment: Drs He and Zheng contributed equally to this study.\nReferences\n1.\nPeiris JS, Lai ST, Poon LL.  et al.

Infection with a novel coronavirus has been implicated as a possible cause of SARS.1 This report updates information on U.S. residents with SARS and summarizes the clinical histories of the five U.S. residents identified as of April 9, 2003, who have both suspected SARS and laboratory evidence of infection with a novel coronavirus.\nEpidemiologic and laboratory investigations of SARS are ongoing. CDC's interim suspected SARS case definition (available at http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/sars/casedefinition.htm) continues to be based on clinical criteria and epidemiologic linkage to other SARS cases or areas with community transmission of SARS; abnormal radiographic findings are not required for suspected cases. The WHO case definition for probable SARS includes radiographic evidence of infiltrates consistent with pneumonia or respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) on chest radiograph.2 Cases reported to WHO outside the United States are probable SARS cases; the United States reports all suspected cases.\nAs of April 9, a total of 2,722 SARS cases have been reported to WHO from 16 countries, including the United States; 106 deaths (case-fatality proportion: 3.9%) have been reported to WHO.3 As of April 9, CDC had received 166 reports from 30 states of suspected SARS cases among U.S. residents; 135 (81%) cases occurred among adults. Of the 166 persons with suspected SARS, 154 (93%) had traveled within the 10 days before illness onset to one or more of the areas listed in the case definition, nine (5%) had household contact with a person with suspected SARS, and three (2%) were health-care workers (HCWs) who had provided medical care to a patient with suspected SARS. The majority of U.S. patients had normal chest radiographs. As of April 9, a total of 33 (20%) patients were reported to have pneumonia or RDS. Of the 60 (36%) patients who were hospitalized for \u226524 hours, four (7%) remained hospitalized as of April 9, and no deaths were reported.\nTravel Advisories\nTravel Advisories\nTravel advisories from WHO and CDC remain in effect. CDC has issued a travel advisory (available at http://www.cdc.gov/travel/other/acute_resp_syn_multi.htm) recommending that persons planning nonessential or elective travel to mainland China, Hong Kong, Hanoi, or Singapore consider postponing such travel until further notice. Persons who have traveled recently to these locations are urged to seek medical care if they develop fever of >100.4\u00b0F (38.0\u00b0C), cough, or difficulty breathing within 10 days of travel and to inform their health-care providers about recent travel to regions where SARS cases have been reported.\nInfection-Control Guidelines\nInfection-Control Guidelines\nInterim infection-control guidelines for health-care, household, and community settings will be updated and revised as new information becomes available. Infection-control practitioners, clinicians providing medical care for patients with suspected SARS, and persons who might have contact with persons with suspected SARS should consult these guidelines frequently to keep current with recommendations (available at http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/sars/index.htm).\nDiagnostic Testing\nDiagnostic Testing\nLaboratory diagnostic tests used at CDC to test clinical specimens for evidence of this novel coronavirus are still in development and are not available outside a research setting. Serologic testing for coronavirus antibody consists of indirect fluorescent antibody testing and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays that are specific for antibody produced after infection. Although some patients have detectable coronavirus antibody within 14 days of illness onset, definitive interpretation of negative coronavirus antibody tests is possible only for specimens obtained >21 days after onset of fever. For other suspected SARS cases in the United States, a second serum specimen collected >21 days after fever onset will be necessary to determine whether infection with the novel coronavirus can be documented. A reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test specific for RNA from the novel coronavirus has been positive within the first 10 days after fever onset in specimens from some SARS patients, but the duration of detectable viremia or viral shedding is unknown, and RT-PCR tests on samples collected during convalescence might be negative. Viral culture followed by RT-PCR also has been used to detect the novel coronavirus in some specimens.\nCase Histories\nCase Histories\nOn April 3, CDC reported to the respective health departments positive coronavirus test results for five persons with SARS. All five had pneumonia requiring hospitalization and had traveled recently to a country in which community transmission had occurred. The five patients did not travel together or at the same time. Although two patients had a common hotel exposure in Hong Kong, no evidence of a single common exposure for all five patients has been found. Specimens from these five patients were among the first tested; patients were selected on the basis of their clinical and exposure histories. A description of the exposure and brief clinical history for each of these five SARS patients follows.\nCase Histories\nCase 1. Patient I is a pregnant woman aged 36 years with a history of intermittent chronic cough; as of April 9, she was in her 26th week of pregnancy. During February 19\u2013March 2, she traveled to Hong Kong and Guangdong province in China to visit her family. While in Hong Kong, she stayed at Hotel M during February 19-22 and again during February 24\u2013March 2. The first stay was on the same floor and during the same time as Patient A (the index case in a large cluster of persons with suspected SARS described previously).1 On February 8, Patient I's intermittent cough resumed. On February 24, she had onset of fever, chills, and headache. During the next 3 days, her cough progressed, and she had shortness of breath, myalgia, and blood-streaked sputum. She sought medical care in Hong Kong and received an antibiotic. Her symptoms worsened, and on return to the United States on March 2, she was hospitalized with a diagnosis of pneumonia. On admission, her temperature was 100.5\u00b0F (38.1\u00b0C), and rales were noted on chest examination. A chest radiograph showed bilateral lower lobe infiltrates, and her oxygen saturation was 93%. Laboratory studies on admission included a white blood cell count (WBC) of 3,300/mm3 (12% lymphocytes), platelets of 103,000/mm3, and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) of 42 U/L. During the next 3 days, despite treatment with broad-spectrum antibiotics, she worsened clinically with persistent fever and progressive pulmonary infiltrates. On March 5, she had respiratory failure and required mechanical ventilation, and oseltamivir was added to her treatment. She improved gradually during the next week and was extubated on March 12. On March 17, she was discharged and was recovering as of April 9. Serologic testing of a serum specimen collected 12 days after illness onset was positive for coronavirus antibody. RT-PCR testing for human metapneumovirus is pending.\nCase Histories\nCase 2. Patient L is a man aged 39 years with a medical history of sleep apnea and hypothyroidism. He traveled on vacation to Thailand on February 23 and then to Hong Kong on March 1. During March 1-6, he stayed at Hotel M, at the same time as three other suspected SARS patients who were ill during their hotel stays.1 On March 6, he returned to the United States. On March 13, he had fever, myalgia, and a mild cough. During the next 3 days, he had diarrhea, vomiting, diaphoresis, and shortness of breath. On March 17, he was hospitalized with pneumonia and a right upper lobe infiltrate on a chest radiograph. Laboratory studies included a WBC of 6,600/mm3 (50% neutrophils and 30% lymphocytes) and platelets of 439,000/mm3. Maximum temperature during hospitalization was 102.4\u00b0F (39.1\u00b0C). He received broad-spectrum antibiotics but no antiviral therapy and was discharged on March 25. Serologic testing of a blood specimen collected 6 days after symptom onset was positive for coronavirus antibody. RT-PCR testing for human metapneumovirus was negative. On March 19, his wife, who had traveled with him to Hong Kong, developed suspected SARS, including pneumonia requiring hospitalization. Her illness onset occurred 13 days after return from Hong Kong and resulted presumably from close contact with patient L.\nCase Histories\nCase 3. Patient X is a woman aged 49 years with a medical history of chronic sinusitis. She traveled to Hong Kong on business on March 2 and returned to the United States on March 8. The same day, she had fever, cough, and shortness of breath for which she sought medical care. She was given an oral antibiotic. Her symptoms persisted; on March 20, she was hospitalized with shortness of breath, chest pain, and rigors. On admission, she had a temperature of 101.4\u00b0F (38.6\u00b0C), a chest radiograph showed interstitial infiltrates, and oxygen saturation on room air was 92%. Laboratory studies on admission included a WBC of 5,100/mm3 (68% neutrophils and 28% lymphocytes), platelets of 156,000/mm3, and ALT of 25 U/L. During her hospitalization, she received broad-spectrum antibiotics and corticosteroids but no antiviral therapy. On March 28, she was discharged in stable condition. An RT-PCR assay detected the novel coronavirus on a sputum specimen collected 14 days after illness onset. RT-PCR testing for human metapneumovirus was negative.\nCase Histories\nCase 4. Patient Y is a man aged 22 years with no notable medical history. He traveled to Hong Kong on vacation on March 3 and returned to the United States on March 6. On March 12, he had onset of fever, chills, myalgia, headache, and shortness of breath. On March 13, he had a cough and chest pain and was treated with oral antibiotics. The following day, he reported to an emergency department (ED) with persistent fever and cough. A chest radiograph demonstrated a right perihilar infiltrate. He received intravenous antibiotics in the ED and was discharged the same day on an oral antibiotic. On March 16, he had worsening shortness of breath and respiratory distress, and was admitted to a hospital intensive-care unit. On admission, his temperature was 102.9\u00b0F (39.4\u00b0C), with an oxygen saturation of 81% on room air. Chest radiograph demonstrated bilateral infiltrates with pleural effusion. Laboratory studies on admission included a WBC of 5,300/mm3 (82% neutrophils and 14% lymphocytes), platelets of 197,000 mm3/mL, and ALT of 74 U/L. He received broad-spectrum antibiotics and oseltamavir. A direct fluorescent antibody assay for influenza type A and influenza type B was negative. By March 20, his condition stabilized, and he was discharged on March 22. Serologic tests of specimens obtained 4, 6, and 13 days after illness onset were positive for antibody to coronavirus.\nCase Histories\nCase 5. Patient Z is a woman aged 53 years with no notable medical history. She traveled to Singapore on February 27 and returned to the United States on March 13. While in Singapore, she visited hospitals that were providing care for patients with pneumonia and had close contact with several persons with probable SARS. She did not use a surgical mask or any respiratory precautions while in the Singapore hospitals. On March 9, she had a headache. During March 12-15, she had fever, chills, and myalgia. On March 15, she was hospitalized with a temperature of 102.7\u00b0F (39.3\u00b0C). On admission, a chest radiograph indicated bilateral basilar atelectasis. Laboratory studies on admission included a WBC of 6,500/mm3 (68% neutrophils and 19% lymphocytes), platelets of 216,000/mm3, and ALT of 56 U/L. She received broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotics but no antiviral therapy. Her condition stabilized by March 21, and she was discharged on March 26. Although serologic testing of a specimen obtained 3 days after fever onset was negative, a second specimen collected 26 days after onset was positive for antibody to coronavirus. RT-PCR testing for human metapneumovirus is pending.\nReported by:\nReported by:\nCDC SARS Investigative Team; M Charles, DO, EIS Officer, CDC.\nCDC Editorial Note:\nCDC Editorial Note:\nEvidence of infection with a novel coronavirus has been identified in patients with suspected SARS in several countries,4-6 including the five patients in the United States described in this report. These patients were among those selected for priority coronavirus testing because of their specific clinical presentations and exposure histories. All had fever and respiratory symptoms (e.g., nonproductive cough, shortness of breath, and radiographic evidence of pneumonia). No consistent abnormal laboratory findings were noted, and the majority were within the normal ranges. Some laboratory tests that have been reported to be elevated in SARS patients, such as lactate dehydrogenase and creatine phosphokinase,4,6,7 were not measured for any of these patients. All five patients received broad-spectrum antibiotics appropriate for coverage of typical and atypical respiratory pathogens. Patients I and Y received oseltamivir, and Patient X received corticosteroids; no patients received ribavirin. These clinical histories are similar to those reported from Canada and Hong Kong, but, as of April 9, no initial characteristic signs or symptoms that clearly distinguish SARS from pneumonia caused by other pathogens have been described.4,6-8 However, if this novel coronavirus is the cause of SARS in these patients, the clinical symptoms described in this report most likely do not represent the full spectrum of illness related to coronavirus infection. Viruses that cause respiratory illness typically are capable of causing a range of clinical manifestations, and asymptomatic infections are possible.\nCDC Editorial Note:\nState and local health departments are coordinating collection of follow-up serum specimens from SARS patients whose initial serum specimen might have been collected too early to indicate serologic evidence of infection. These results and investigations among well household and other well contacts of SARS patients (including travelers who were on airline flights with persons with SARS symptoms) will provide additional information about the spectrum of illness among patients with SARS and coronavirus infection.\nCDC Editorial Note:\nThe majority of U.S. residents with SARS, including the five persons described in this report who had evidence of coronavirus infection, have recovered or stabilized clinically without specific antiviral therapy. The efficacy of available antiviral therapies against coronavirus infection is unknown. Ribavirin is a known teratogen, and clinicians who use it should be aware of all potential adverse events, including severe hemolytic anemia.9 Preliminary results from in vitro testing indicate that ribavirin concentrations that inhibit ribavirin-sensitive viruses do not inhibit replication or cell-to-cell spread of the novel coronavirus (JW Huggins, U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases, personal communication, 2003). However, further in vitro testing of antiviral drugs on other coronavirus isolates, and more information on the clinical outcomes of patients treated with ribavirin or other antiviral drugs in controlled trials is needed.\nCDC Editorial Note:\nIn several countries, widespread community transmission, as well as transmission among HCWs, has been observed. As of April 9, no U.S. HCWs who provided care for the five patients with coronavirus infection described in this report had suspected SARS. Among the close contacts of these five SARS patients, only one (the wife of Patient L) has suspected SARS. The different transmission patterns observed probably are not attributable to differences in infection-control practices alone. The inability to predict which patients are more capable of transmitting the virus that causes SARS underscores the need to adhere strictly to infection-control recommendations in both health-care and household settings. Similarly, close contacts of SARS patients should be vigilant to detect fever or respiratory symptoms, and persons who develop fever or respiratory symptoms should seek health-care evaluation.\nCDC Editorial Note:\nOn April 4, 2003, the president of the United States signed an executive order adding SARS to the list of quarantinable communicable diseases (http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2003/04/iraq/20030404-8.html). This act provides CDC, through its Division of Global Migration and Quarantine, with the legal authority to implement isolation and quarantine measures as part of transmissible disease-control measures, if necessary. Isolation refers to the practice of keeping a patient with a communicable disease separate from other persons, usually within a health-care facility or at home. Isolation is used routinely in hospital and health-care settings to reduce the transmission of infections to uninfected patients. Quarantine refers to any situation in which a person or group of persons who have been exposed to a communicable disease and might be infected, but who are not yet ill, are kept apart from others to prevent disease spread. States generally have authority to invoke and enforce quarantine within their jurisdictions although quarantine laws vary among states. Quarantine is an effective public health tool. Quarantine in the United States is used primarily to restrict patients with pulmonary tuberculosis who remain infectious but are unable or unwilling to remain in settings where they are less likely to transmit illness. During the previous month, health officials in Singapore, Hong Kong, and Canada have implemented quarantine and isolation measures to limit the spread of SARS.\nCDC Editorial Note:\nAlthough evidence is accumulating that a novel coronavirus is the primary causative agent of SARS, more laboratory and epidemiologic data are needed before this link is established fully. Once definitive identification of the cause of SARS has been achieved, an intensive focus on development of effective treatment regimens might reduce morbidity and mortality of patients with SARS. However, specific measures to prevent transmission (e.g., vaccination programs, prophylactic drugs, or hyperimmune globulin) might require more time to develop and implement. In the interim, strengthening traditional public health functions such as collection and rapid analysis of surveillance and epidemiologic data, and implementing essential infection-control measures for suspected SARS patients and their contacts, will be the mainstay of SARS control. A sustained and cooperative global public health response will be necessary to limit further dissemination of SARS and to prepare for emerging global microbial threats.\nReferences\n1.\nCDC.

Muscle weakness and elevated serum creatine kinase levels are commonly encountered in patients with SARS. However, the nature and cause of myopathy associated with a SARS infection are unknown because, to our knowledge, there has been no report of histological or postmortem examination of the skeletal muscle from SARS-infected patients.\nObjective  To determine the exact nature of the myopathy associated with SARS.\nMethod  Postmortem skeletal muscles from 8 consecutive patients who died of SARS in March 2003 were studied under light and electron microscopy as well as immunohistochemistry.\nResults  Focal myofiber necrosis was identified in 4 of 8 cases. Macrophage infiltration and regenerative fiber were scanty. All 4 patients treated with a steroid had significant myofiber atrophy. In situ hybridization for coronavirus was negative in all subjects. Viral cultures for coronavirus and examination for viral particles under electron microscopy were performed in 2 patients. The viral culture yielded no organisms and there were no viral particles seen on electron microscopic examination.\nConclusions  There is a spectrum of myopathic changes associated with a SARS infection. Focal myofiber necrosis is common and possibly is immune mediated. Critical illness myopathy and superimposed steroid myopathy may also play an important role in SARS.\nThe severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), which is associated with a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV), is regarded mainly as a respiratory disease that had led to severe morbidity and mortality in its outbreak in March 2003.1,2 Apart from noticeable lung damage,3 muscle weakness and an elevated serum creatine kinase (CK) level occurred in more than 30% of the SARS-infected patients.1 Elevation of the serum CK level is likely a result of skeletal muscle myopathy because the cardiac isozyme level was typically normal.1 In view of the potential infectious risk to the health care workers, the exact nature of the myopathy is unknown because postmortem examination has been limited to the lungs. Thus, to our knowledge, there has been no report of postmortem study of the myopathy associated with SARS.\nMethods\nPatients who were diagnosed as having SARS based on the World Health Organization case definition of a \u201cprobable case\u201d4 and who underwent a postmortem examination in March and April 2003 were included in this study. All patients had radiographic evidence of infiltrates consistent with pneumonia or respiratory distress syndrome on a chest x-ray film and had autopsy findings consistent with the pathology of respiratory distress syndrome without an identifiable cause.4 Among the 8 cases recruited, 7 cases were from the Prince of Wales Hospital and the remaining case was from Princess Margaret Hospital both located in Hong Kong. Six cases were traced to the same index patient who traveled from Guangdong Province to Hong Kong in February 2003. The remaining 2 patients contracted SARS in the community. All developed SARS pneumonitis, and mechanical ventilatory assistance was instituted for 6 patients. Two were treated conservatively owing to a poor premorbid state and concurrent lung cancer. The median age was 72 years (age range, 44-81 years). Seven patients were men. All had concurrent medical disorders, but none had primary myopathy. Cause of death was respiratory failure in all cases. Skeletal muscles were sampled in a limited postmortem examination in 7 cases and a full postmortem examination in the remaining case. The specimens obtained were from either the quadriceps or the psoas. Tissues from 2 patients were sent for viral cultures for SARS-CoV according to standard protocols. The rest was fixed in formalin. Tissues were processed for in situ hybridization for SARS-CoV in all cases and for electron microscopy (EM) in 2 cases. Paraffin sections were stained for MAC387, IgG, IgM, C3, fibrinogen, CD4, CD8, CD20, and CD68 (all from Dako, Copenhagen, Denmark).\nResults\nThe laboratory and pathologic findings are summarized in the Table. Myofiber necrosis was observed in 4 cases and was the most common feature. The necrotic fibers were mostly single and occasionally were 2 necrotic fibers seen close to one another (Figure 1). The necrosis was coagulative with condensation and fragmentation of sarcolemmal contents (Figure 1A). In 2 of 4 patients with myofiber necrosis, there was karyorrhexis with nuclear debris scattered over the necrotic cells (Figure 1B, arrow). The debris was visualized as nuclear dusts in some cells. Necrotic fibers were mostly devoid of macrophage infiltrates, although some necrotic fibers attracted some histiocytic infiltrates (Figure 1C and D). In contrast with myofiber necrosis seen in inflammatory myopathy, regenerative fibers were only revealed in 2 cases (Figure 2A). On longitudinal sections, the nuclei were visualized as rows of naked closely packed nuclei (Figure 2B). The necrotic fibers were also seen to accumulate a small amount of IgG, IgM, C3, and fibrinogen (Figure 2C) but without other chronic inflammatory or lymphocytic infiltration. The scanty macrocytic infiltrates could be highlighted in MAC386 or CD68 stain (Figure 2D). In addition, specimens from 4 patients showed severe myofiber atrophy. The atrophic fibers showed extensive pallor in staining and a focal feathery type of dissolution of cytoplasmic contents (Figure 3, arrows). Ultrastructural examination was performed in 2 patients. The focal necrotic fibers were seen with dissolution of myofibrillar architecture and plasma membrane and with the loss of Z disks; but basal lamina was generally preserved (Figure 4). No viral particle was identified at EM. In situ hybridization was negative for SARS-CoV in all of the patients.\nComment\nTo our knowledge, there has been no previous report about the myopathy associated with SARS. In our postmortem case series, there were 2 characteristic histological findings: (1) Significant myofiber atrophy was noted in all 4 patients who received intravenous steroid therapy (cumulative dose ranged from 0.45-4.4 g or the equivalent of hydrocortisone). This feature was absent in patients who did not receive steroid therapy. (2) Myofiber necrosis was identified in 4 of 8 cases. It was typically focal with scanty inflammatory infiltrates.\nAlthough myofiber atrophy is characteristic of steroid myopathy, administration of a steroid alone is insufficient to explain the florid atrophy given the relatively short duration of steroid treatment (range, 3-11 days). A plausible explanation would be critical illness myopathy (CIM) that may develop in patients who received mechanical ventilatory assistance and high-dose steroid therapy.5-7 Critical illness myopathy is common,8,9 and its incidence may range from 33% to 83% in an intensive care unit.7 Prolonged mechanical ventilatory assistance and use of high-dose steroid therapy were identified as independent predictors for CIM in a prospective study.10 In our patients, the use of rocuronium, a steroidal neuromuscular blocking agent, during mechanical ventilation may also contribute to the development of CIM.7 In previous studies of CIM, both electrodiagnostic tests and histological findings were required for confirmation11,12; however, in view of the uncertain infectious risk during the March 2003 outbreak, electrodiagnostic tests were not performed. Nevertheless, myofiber atrophy and a variable degree of myofiber necrosis, which are typical in CIM, were evident in our series. Although we did not reveal widespread loss of thick (myosin) filaments in the 2 patients processed for EM study, it is still consistent with early CIM as myosin loss may not be apparent until 4 weeks after the administration of intravenous steroid therapy (the longest duration of symptoms before death was 19 days in our group).12,13 Therefore, based on clinical generalized flaccid paresis, associated risk factors (use of intravenous steroid therapy, steroidal muscle relaxant, and mechanical ventilation), elevated serum CK levels, and light microscopy histological features, the diagnosis of probable CIM is tenable. The absence of myofiber atrophy in patients who did not receive steroid therapy suggests that the steroid could be an important cofactor in the pathogenesis of CIM.14-16\nAs mentioned, the myofiber necrosis observed was focal. It is uncertain whether this predominantly reflected the probable CIM or was also SARS-CoV\u2013related. Other RNA viruses, like influenza virus17-19 and hepatitis C virus,20 may give rise to similar focal myofiber necrosis. Since SARS-CoV is also an RNA virus, it raised the possibility of SARS-associated myopathy. In addition, in 2 of 4 patients with focal necrosis, no steroid or rocuronium therapy was given. In patient 8, the focal and isolated myofiber necrosis revealed (Figure 1B) may suggest myopathy other than CIM as this patient received neither treatment with a steroid or rocuronium nor mechanical ventilatory assistance. Further investigation for the specificity of this focal myofiber necrosis could be helpful because if such a relationship can be confirmed, similar findings in patients with myopathy or an elevated serum CK level as the predominant feature in the prepneumonic stage should raise the suspicion of SARS.\nIn most of the past series of influenza-associated myopathy, viral culture yielded no organisms.17,18,20 Although in one previous study the reverse transcription\u2013polymerase chain reaction could demonstrate virions in the muscles of experimental influenza-associated myopathy, they were not thought to be replicative. In our cases, the negative finding of in situ hybridization and viral culture for SARS-CoV, and the absence of viral particles under EM may suggest that the myofiber necrosis could be a result of immune damage from release of various cytokines instead of direct infection of the skeletal muscles.21 Damage to the lung in SARS is also considered related to the release of cytokines.3\nIn the semiquantification of necrotic fibers, there is a suggestion that patients with a higher serum CK level had more extensive myofiber necrosis, and thus, the serum CK level may reflect the severity of myopathy associated with SARS. As 30% of the patients with SARS had elevated serum CK levels, and more than 60% of these patients had myalgia and objective muscle weakness on presentation,1 myopathy in SARS could actually be common. In our series, all of the patients experienced progressive myalgia and muscle weakness from the early course of the disease. The weakness was typically truncal and symmetrically over the proximal limbs and neck flexors. The facial, ocular, bulbar, and small muscles of the hands were relatively spared. All of our patients had become bed-bound from the myalgia and muscle weakness before the respiratory failure set in. Nevertheless, further assessment was impossible when a neuromuscular blocking agent was used during mechanical ventilation. Further prospective study with a larger sample is needed to confirm the relationship of the serum CK levels and myopathy in SARS.\nBecause CIM commonly involves respiratory muscles12 and is associated with prolonged respiratory failure and difficulties in weaning the patient from mechanical ventilation,22 the recognition of probable CIM in this series may influence the future management of SARS. As mechanical ventilation and concomitant high-dose steroid therapy (eg, consecutive pulses of methylprednisolone, 500 mg each) were often used in severe SARS pneumonitis,1,23 physicians should carefully weigh the pros and cons of high-dose steroid therapy when one considers that the resulting CIM may prolong the muscle weakness and respiratory failure and subsequently hinder the rehabilitation of the survivors.10,24\nOur study provides preliminary evidence that there is a spectrum of myopathy associated with SARS. This spectrum is common among patients with fatal SARS and may result from CIM and immune response to SARS-CoV. However, there were limitations to the present study. Tissue specimens were not prepared by standard frozen section examination because of the unknown infectious risk at the time of the outbreak, and adenosine triphosphatase staining was not performed. Furthermore, electrophysiological studies that could have been invaluable for screening and assessing the extent of the myopathy were infeasible during the SARS epidemic. Further prospective studies to document the frequency, severity, clinical significance, and interplay of CIM and SARS-associated myopathy are warranted.\nBack to top\nArticle Information\nCorrespondence: Thomas W.

Comparative estimates of the contribution of causative pathogens to the burden of disease are essential for targeted vaccine development.\nObjective To determine the viral etiology of severe pneumonia among infants and children at a rural Kenyan hospital using comprehensive and sensitive molecular diagnostic techniques.\nDesign, Setting, and Participants Prospective observational and case-control study during 2007 in a rural Kenyan district hospital. Participants were children aged 1 day to 12 years, residing in a systematically enumerated catchment area, and who either were admitted to Kilifi District Hospital meeting World Health Organization clinical criteria for severe pneumonia or very severe pneumonia; (2) presented with mild upper respiratory tract infection but were not admitted; or (3) were well infants and children attending for immunization.\nMain Outcome Measures The presence of respiratory viruses and the odds ratio for admission with severe disease.\nResults Of 922 eligible admitted patients, 759 were sampled (82% [median age, 9 months]). One or more respiratory viruses were detected in 425 of the 759 sampled (56% [95% confidence interval {CI}, 52%-60%]). Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) was detected in 260 participants (34% [95% CI, 31%-38%]) and other respiratory viruses were detected in 219 participants (29%; 95% CI, 26%-32%), the most common being Human coronavirus 229E (n = 51 [6.7%]), influenza type A (n = 44 [5.8%]), Parainfluenza type 3 (n = 29 [3.8%]), Human adenovirus (n = 29 [3.8%]), and Human metapneumovirus (n = 23 [3.0%]). Compared with well control participants, detection of RSV was associated with severe disease (5% in control participants; adjusted odds ratio, 6.11 [95% CI, 1.65-22.6]) while collectively, other respiratory viruses were not associated with severe disease (23% in control participants; adjusted odds ratio, 1.27 [95% CI, 0.64-2.52]).\nConclusion In a sample of Kenyan infants and children admitted with severe pneumonia to a rural hospital, RSV was the predominant viral pathogen.\nPneumonia is the leading cause of childhood death in sub-Saharan Africa. The main means for controlling disease and death due to pneumonia are infant vaccination and case management. Thus, establishing the contribution to severe disease of individual pathogens and vaccine efficacy in infancy are essential to reducing the burden of disease.\nObservational studies, including microbial cultures and vaccine probe studies, have identified Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae as the most common bacterial causes.1,2 Both are preventable by currently available conjugate vaccines. Consequently, other bacteria, eg, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and Pneumocystis jiroveci, and respiratory viruses are becoming of increased importance.3 Vaccines currently exist or are in development for several respiratory viruses including respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza type A (FLUAV), and Human parainfluenza virus 3 (HPIV-3), including combinations.4-6 In previous studies in sub-Saharan Africa, viral etiology of pneumonia has been examined by antigen detection, serology, and viral culture.7-11\nThe development of molecular methods has led to 2 advances in viral diagnosis: increased sensitivity and the discovery of new viruses of clinical importance. However, the high sensitivity of molecular diagnostics raises questions about specificity since viral nucleic acid sequences may be detected in healthy children and may persist after illness.12 The detection of multiple respiratory viruses by molecular methods in individual cases further underlines this etiological quandary.13 To date, we have found no published studies reporting comprehensive viral etiology of pneumonia among children in sub-Saharan Africa using sensitive molecular diagnostic methods.\nWe aimed to determine viral etiology, incidence, and clinical features among infants and children meeting World Health Organization (WHO) clinical criteria for severe pneumonia or very severe pneumonia admitted to a rural Kenyan district hospital.\nMethods\nLocation\nThe study was conducted at Kilifi District Hospital in a rural area on the Kenyan coast. Humidity is high throughout the year and there are 2 annual rainy seasons, April through July and November through December.14 The area is endemic for malaria, with declining transmission over the last 10 years. H influenzae type b conjugate vaccine, given with the diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and pertussis vaccine to infants aged 6, 10, and 14 weeks, was introduced in 2001. Coverage of these vaccines (third dose) and measles vaccine administered at 9 months of age are greater than 90%.15 Conjugate pneumococcal vaccine had not been introduced at the time of this study.\nThe Collaborative Research Programme between the Kenya Medical Research Institute (KEMRI) and the Wellcome Trust provides clinical care on the hospital pediatric wards and a demographic surveillance system covering an area of approximately 900 km,2 which is within 50 km north, 50 km south, and 30 km west of the hospital, and includes a population of approximately 240 000. The area was mapped in 2000 and every building was registered by global positioning system. The population register is updated for births, deaths, and migration events by household visits with 3 re-enumeration rounds each year.16 All field-based data are checked, double-entered, and verified within 48 hours of acquisition. Since 2002, patients admitted to the hospital are individually identified on the population register. In 2007, approximately 65% of pediatric admissions were confirmed residents of the census area.\nParticipants and Clinical Methods\nWe included all children aged 1 day to 12 years residing in the census area and who were admitted to the pediatric wards between January 1, 2007, and December 31, 2007, and met WHO criteria for the clinical syndromes of severe pneumonia (cough or difficult breathing plus lower chest wall indrawing and no signs of very severe pneumonia) or very severe pneumonia (cough or difficult breathing plus at least 1 of hypoxia, defined as an oxygen saturation <90% by fingertip pulse oximetry [Covidien-Nellcor, Boulder, Colorado], inability to drink or breast feed, inability to sit, or impaired consciousness at admission,17 including infants younger than 2 months of age).\nClinicians were trained in the recognition of the clinical signs used in the WHO criteria through teaching sessions that included videos, practical demonstrations, and additional bedside training on the wards. Clinical findings were individually recorded for each item of history or examination in a database during the admission assessment. Next, a standardized set of investigations were performed including complete blood cell count (Beckman Coulter Inc, Brea, California), blood film for malaria parasites (stained with Giemsa and read at \u00d7 1000 magnification), blood culture (Bactec PedsPlus [Becton Dickinson and Co, Franklin Lakes, New Jersey]) processed by standard methods,18 and a nasal wash sample.19 Nasal washes were conducted between 8 AM and 10 PM daily. Nasal wash was not performed on infants and children with severe respiratory or cardiovascular compromise.\nHuman immunodeficiency virus (HIV) testing was performed according to the Kenyan national policy for all pediatric hospital admissions using 2 rapid antibody tests: Determine (Inverness Medical Innovations Inc, Waltham, Massachusetts) and Unigold (Trinity Biotech, Bray, Ireland). Children and their families who tested HIV positive were given further counseling and referred to the hospital comprehensive HIV care clinic.\nFor this analysis, capillary refill time of 3 seconds or more was used as a marker of circulatory shock. Severe anemia was defined as a hemoglobin level of less than 5 g/dL. Severe malnutrition was defined as weight-for-height z score of less than \u22123 (National Centers for Health Statistics reference standards, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, Georgia) or kwashiorkor.17 Treatment for pneumonia and other conditions was according to current WHO guidelines.17\nTo estimate the association of respiratory viral infection with severe disease, we recruited 2 further sets of children resident in the census area by convenience sampling from May 1, 2007, to April 30, 2008: children with mild upper respiratory tract infection (URTI)\u2014including symptoms of cough, runny or blocked nose, sore throat, or sneezing, being managed as outpatients and not meeting any criteria for pneumonia; and well infants and children\u2014without any symptoms or signs of upper or lower respiratory infection attending for routine immunization at the hospital. After obtaining clinical history and examining these participants, a nasal wash specimen was taken.\nLaboratory Methods\nNasal wash samples were stored at \u221280\u00b0C and batch analyzed at study end at the University of Pretoria, South Africa. Total viral nucleic acids were extracted from 200 \u03bcL of the respiratory specimens using the Magnapure LC Total Nucleic Acid Isolation Kit (Roche, Manheim, Germany), following manufacturer instructions. Complementary DNA was synthesized using Expand Reverse Transcriptase (Roche). Real-time polymerase chain reactions (PCRs) were performed using the LightCycler Fast Start DNA MasterPLUS HybProbe kit (Roche) for the following: Human adenovirus (HAdV), Human parainfluenza virus 1 (HPIV-1), Human parainfluenza virus 2 (HPIV-2), HPIV-3, RSV, FLUAV, influenza type B, Human metapneumovirus (HMPV), Human bocavirus (HBoV), Human coronavirus OC43 (HCoV-OC43), HCoV/Hong Kong, HCoV-229E, and HCoV-NL63. PCR amplicons for DNA sequencing were gel purified using the Wizard SV gel and PCR Clean-Up System (Promega, Madison, Wisconsin), according to the manufacturer's instructions. DNA sequencing was performed with specific primers using the ABI PRISM BigDye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Reaction kit (version 3.1) on an ABI PRISM 3130 DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, California), following manufacturer instructions.\nStatistical Analysis\nStatistical analysis was performed using STATA 9.1 (Stata Corp, College Station, Texas). Eligibility and classification of the clinical syndromes of pneumonia were determined from the original record of each item of medical history and examination in the database.\nIncidence rates were estimated using data from all eligible patient admissions known to be resident in the census area on the day of admission, and the midstudy (July 1, 2007) census population estimates interpolated from the linear equation determined by regressing population size (log10) for all enumeration rounds to the end of 2008 against the mid-date of each round.\nTo describe demographic and clinical features of cases of severe and very severe pneumonia, we compared those with and without a respiratory virus detected. Proportions were compared using the \u03c72 and Fisher exact tests as appropriate. Continuous data were compared by t test or the Kruskal-Wallis rank sum test. Variables presented were selected a priori from more than 50 clinical variables collected. No adjustment was made for multiple comparisons because each variable represents a discrete test of a biologically plausible hypothesis.\nTo estimate the strength of association of detection of RSV and non-RSV viruses with severe disease, we compared patients admitted with severe and very severe pneumonia with control group participants comprising well infants and children (excluding those with signs of URTI) using a case-control design. Odds ratios (ORs) were calculated by multivariable logistic regression and presented models for RSV (including those with RSV plus an additional virus) and respiratory viruses not including RSV that were unadjusted (model 1); and adjusted for age and season in monthly intervals (model 2). To address a potential bias of underrepresentation of fatal cases, the (unadjusted) ORs for severe disease among all eligible admitted patients were modeled by imposing the proportions with RSV and other viruses detected among fatal and nonfatal sampled cases on all eligible admissions (model 3). All tests were 2-sided with a 5% significance level.\nSample size for the case group was determined by previous annual admissions, which would allow the prevalence of pathogens of 5% and 20% to be estimated with precision of \u00b1 2% and \u00b1 3%, respectively. We aimed to recruit 100 well control participants and 100 individuals with mild URTI to describe specificities of 95% and 85%, with a lower-side precision of \u22126% and \u22128%, respectively. Power for the case-control analysis was confirmed for the actual numbers sampled using the method described by Fliess.20\nEthical Approval\nThe study was approved by the Kenyan National Ethical Review Committee (SSC 815) and the Oxford Tropical Ethical Review Committee (011 06). Individual written informed consent was obtained from parents or guardians of all participants.\nResults\nFrom January 1, 2007, through December 31, 2007, there were 922 eligible infants and children with severe pneumonia or very severe pneumonia admitted, and viral screening was conducted on 759 patients (82%) (Figure 1). Median age was 9.0 months (interquartile range [IQR], 3.0-20), 59% were male, and 52 had a positive HIV rapid antibody test (6.9%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 5.2%-8.9%). Children who were not sampled were more severely ill than those sampled (eTable 1). Three-quarters of deaths among nonsampled admitted patients occurred within 24 hours of admission.\nOne or more respiratory viruses were detected in 425 participants in the case group (56% [95% CI, 52%-60%]; Table 1). RSV was the most commonly detected virus, present in 260 admissions overall (34% [95% CI, 31%-38%]; eTable 2), and in 192 of 453 infants (42% [95% CI, 38%-47%]). RSV was strongly seasonal (P < .001), detected in more than 50% of pneumonia cases in January, February, and December, but in fewer than 5% of pneumonia cases from July through September (Figure 2). Other viruses showing clear seasonality were HMPV, HPIV-3, and FLUAV (eFigure).\nOther respiratory viruses were detected in 219 admissions (29% [95% CI, 26%-32%]; eTable 2 and eFigure). These included HCoV-229E (n = 51 [6.7%]), FLUAV (n = 44 [5.8%]), HPIV-3 (n = 29 [3.8%]), HAdV (n = 29 [3.8%]), HMPV (n = 23 [3.0%]), HPIV-1 (2.4%), HBoV (2.1%), HCoV-OC43 (1.8%), HPIV-2 (1.3%), HCoV-NL63 (1.3%), influenza type B (0.1%), and HCoV/Hong Kong-1 (0.1%).\nRSV plus 1 or more other respiratory viruses were detected in 54 cases (7%), representing 21% (95% CI, 16%-26%) of all RSV cases. These comprised HCoV-229E (14), FLUAV (10), HAdV (10), HPIV-3 (6), HBoV (6), HMPV (3), HPIV-1 (3), HPIV-2 (3), HCoV-NL63 (2), and HCoV-OC43 (1).\nThe incidence of admission with severe pneumonia or very severe pneumonia was 4.8% per child per year in the first year of life, 1.5% per child per year in children younger than 5 years of age, and 0.1% among children who were 5 years of age or older (Table 2). The incidence of admission for any respiratory virus and with RSV was highest in the first year of life (3.0% per child per year and 2.0% per child per year, respectively).\nPatients admitted with respiratory viruses detected were a median age of 7.5 months (IQR, 2.7-18) and were younger than those with no virus detected (median age, 11.3 months [IQR, 3.8-24]; P < .001) . However, this effect was completely accounted for by RSV (Table 3). Very severe pneumonia was less common among patients admitted with respiratory viruses (P < .001). There was no association between the presence of wheezing or hypoxia and a respiratory virus being detected. Most participants in the case group with RSV did not have an admission diagnosis of bronchiolitis. Patients admitted with RSV were less severely ill and had fewer adverse risk factors than those admitted with no virus and were less likely to be prematurely born, in circulatory shock, severely malnourished, or to die. Of the 2 deaths among children with RSV, both had congenital heart disease. Patients admitted with respiratory viruses other than RSV were similar in all these respects to those admitted with no virus detected. Among 24 deaths, 8 (33%; 95% CI, 16%-55%) occurred in patients admitted with a virus detected.\nThirty-six patients admitted with severe or very severe pneumonia (4.7% [95% CI, 3.3%-6.5%]) were bacteremic, with 16 having a respiratory virus detected (44% [95% CI, 28%-62%]). Bacterial species were Streptococcus pneumoniae (12), Escherichia coli (9), nontyphoidal salmonella (3), Staphylococcus aureus (3), Acinetobacter species (3), \u03b2-hemolytic streptococci (3), Enterobacter species (2), and H influenzae (1).\nAmong 57 well infants and children (median age, 6.0 months [IQR, 3.3-11]) and 96 children with symptoms of mild URTI (median age, 13 months; IQR, 5.6-25), respiratory viruses were detected in 28% and 44%, respectively, and were less frequent than among admitted pneumonia cases (P < .001 and P = .03, respectively [Table 1]). These differences were due to RSV since overall, viruses other than RSV were as common in well infants and children and those with mild URTI as among admitted patients in the case group (Table 1). Among those with mild URTI, viruses detected were RSV (18%), HAdV (8%), FLUAV (7%), HBoV (5%), HMPV (3%), HCoV-229E (3%), HPIV-1 (2%), HCoV/Hong Kong-1 (2%), and HCoV-OC43 (2%); and viruses found in well infants and children were RSV (5%), HBoV (9%), HCoV-OC43 (7%), and less than 1% for each of HPIV-1, HPIV-3, HAdV, HCoV/Hong Kong-1, and HCoV-229E. FLUAV and HMPV were not detected among well infants (eTable 2).\nDetection of RSV was associated with admission with severe disease (34%) when compared with well control participants (5% [OR, 9.38; 95% CI, 2.99-47.3]) using model 1. There was no evidence of an association between viruses other than RSV and severe disease, (22% in those admitted with severe or very severe pneumonia and 23% in control participants [OR, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.48-1.94] using model 1). Models adjusted for age and calendar month (model 2) showed no evidence of lack of fit (Hosmer-Lemeshow \u03c72, 7.19; P = .52) and did not qualitatively alter this result (OR for RSV, 6.11 [95% CI, 1.65-22.6], and non-RSV viruses [OR, 1.27; 95% CI, 0.64-2.52]). ORs in model 3, including all eligible admissions, to address the potential bias of underrepresentation of fatal cases, did not differ significantly from the observed, unadjusted ORs (model 3 for RSV only, 8.99 [95% CI, 2.87-45.2], and for non-RSV viruses 0.88 [95% CI, 0.45-1.83], when compared with model 1).\nComment\nWe found that in the catchment area of Kilifi District Hospital on the Kenyan coast, the incidence of admission with clinical syndromes of severe or very severe pneumonia ranged from 4.8% in the first year of life to 0.1% among participants aged 5 years or older. RSV was detected in one-third of cases overall and in almost half of infant cases. The seasonality of severe pneumonia was almost entirely determined by RSV. No other virus was identified in more than 7% of admitted infants or children, and these participants in the case group were clinically similar to those in whom no virus was detected. Viruses other than RSV were as common among well infants and children and those with mild URTI as among those with severe disease. These findings suggest that non-RSV viruses make only a minor contribution to the burden of severe clinical pneumonia in this setting.\nIn a previous study in the same enumerated population of Kilifi (2002 through 2007), RSV was detected by immunofluorescence in 15% of severe pneumonia or very severe pneumonia admissions of children younger than 5 years of age, increasing to 27% during epidemic periods. Incidence from 2006 to 2007 was estimated at 0.99% and 0.27% per child/year in infants and children younger than 5 years of age, respectively.14 In the present study, we found approximately twice the incidence. It is known that real-time PCR is more sensitive than traditional diagnostics. In a study by Kuypers et al,21 RSV detected by both immunofluorescence and PCR had a mean viral load of 6.1 \u00d7 107 copies per mL, whereas RSV detected by PCR only had a lower mean viral load of 4.1 \u00d7 104 copies per mL. An immunofluorescence assay detected only 19% of RSV with viral loads of less than 106 copies per mL.\nWe considered whether our findings could be due to detection of persistent viral RNA or false-positive laboratory results, but believe this is unlikely. First, considering our well control participants, if an assumption is made that all of the RSV detected are false positives due to persistence or laboratory error, then our test specificity is 95% (95% CI 85% to 99%). This is similar to data reported for immunofluorescence. Such specificity would not significantly alter the interpretation of our findings among case participants. This is further supported by an OR suggesting that detection of RSV was strongly associated with severe disease. To compare these findings with those from traditional methods, we examined published data from 8 previous studies in developing countries, using immunofluorescence, serology, or viral culture.7,8,11,22-27 Overall, RSV was detected in 746 of 3463 (21.5%) case participants and in 29 of 1203 (2.4%) control participants, giving a pooled (fixed-effects) OR for disease (unadjusted for age and season) of 11.1 (95% CI, 7.69-16.0), which is close to the unadjusted OR in our study.\nHigh prevalence of RSV in children admitted with severe clinical pneumonia (34%), in contrast with prevalence in well control participants (5%), further supports that RSV vaccination may offer considerable public health benefit. Although the development of a vaccine for the key target age group of infants (<2 months) has focused on live virus vaccines, none has achieved requisite levels of both safety and immunogenicity.4 A combined HPIV-3/RSV live-attenuated vaccine (Medi-534 [MedImmune LLC, Gaithersburg, Maryland]) for use in young infants (\u22642 months) and in older infants and young children (6-<24 months) is currently undergoing phase 1 and 2 clinical trials.28 Ideally, such trials should be accompanied by modeling studies of the potential consequences on effectiveness of delayed delivery to older infants29,30 in whom vaccine safety and immunogenicity are demonstrably improved.5,31\nOf equal interest to the high prevalence of participants in the case group with RSV detected, is the low proportion of participants in the case group with any of the other respiratory viruses. The real-time PCR assay that we used has previously been shown to be sensitive for these viruses.32 It is possible that the use of nasal washings targets a site within the upper respiratory tract that is preferred by RSV over any other virus. However, to our knowledge, there are no definitive studies in the literature that clearly identify selective bias in the range of respiratory viruses detectable in different parts of the upper respiratory tract using molecular diagnostics.\nInfluenza and HPIV-3 have been the most frequently detected viruses, other than RSV, in studies using traditional diagnostics in sub-Saharan Africa. We found that HCoV-229E and HMPV were the most commonly detected non-RSV viruses in case participants. However, these viruses appear to be common in the community (control group participants) causing URTI, and some are present in well control participants. In a nonepidemic period, we estimate that as much as approximately 6% of severe disease is associated with FLUAV. There appears to be little potential to prevent severe disease through vaccination against HPIV-3.\nStrengths of our study include systematic sampling of well-characterized hospitalized children from a well-established, enumerated population base, and detection of a comprehensive set of respiratory viruses.\nOur study has several limitations. As in similar studies, our sampling missed most deaths because nasal washing cannot be conducted in the sickest children. However, our sensitivity analysis (model 3) suggests this is unlikely to significantly alter the main findings. We did not screen for rhinovirus and there were a lack of radiographic data. Our data reflect a single site and findings in other ecological settings may differ. We applied WHO guidelines carefully and there was good availability of clinical staff, oxygen, and drugs. Case fatality may differ in locations where resources are more constrained. Our well control participants were limited in number since we did not achieve our target sample size due to factors outside of our control. Additionally, our well control participants were a convenience sample and not matched to exactly the same calendar year. Small numbers resulted in wide CIs in some subgroups. However, power was sufficient (>99%) for our case-control analysis of RSV. It is likely that not all cases of severe pneumonia in the community were admitted to hospital, thus our incidence estimates are the minimum. There is a demonstrable decay with increased distance from the hospital in the incidences of all childhood admissions and of admissions with detectable RSV.14 A study spanning only 1 year and from a single location cannot expect to account for likely variation in the occurrence of respiratory viruses from year to year.\nIn summary, our study of the occurrence of respiratory viruses in children admitted with clinical syndromes of severe or very severe pneumonia to a rural district hospital in coastal Kenya has identified more than 50% of case participants with a detectable virus in whom RSV was clearly predominant. We estimate that the prevention of RSV-associated severe pneumonia might reduce all-cause clinically severe or very severe pneumonia admissions to the Kilifi District Hospital by one-third. This contrasts with no evidence to suggest a marked effect on such admissions would occur from the prevention of any other respiratory virus, with the possible exception of FLUAV. Further molecular-based studies of respiratory virus etiology of severe pneumonia over longer periods and in multiple settings in sub-Saharan Africa are needed.\nBack to top\nArticle Information\nCorresponding Author: James A.

New OM episodes are usually coincident with a viral upper respiratory tract infection (vURTI), but there are conflicting data regarding the association between specific viruses and OM.\nDesign  Longitudinal (October-March), prospective follow-up of children for coldlike illness (CLI) by diary, middle ear status by pneumatic otoscopy, and vURTI by PCR.\nSetting  Academic medical centers.\nParticipants  A total of 102 families with at least 2 children aged between 1 and 5 years (213 children; mean [SD] age, 3.7 [1.5] years; 110 male; and 176 white) were recruited from the local communities at 2 study sites by advertisement.\nMain Outcome Measures  New OM and CLI episodes and nasopharyngeal virus detections.\nResults  A total of 176 children (81%) had isolated PCR detection of at least 1 virus. The OM coincidence rates were 62 of 144 (44%) for rhinovirus, 15 of 27 (56%) for respiratory syncytial virus, 8 of 11 (73%) and 1 of 5 (20%) for influenza A and B, respectively, 6 of 12 (50%) for adenovirus, 7 of 18 (39%) for coronavirus, and 4 of 11 (36%) for parainfluenza virus detections (P = .37). For rhinovirus, new OM occurred in 50% of children with and 32% without a concurrent CLI (P = .15), and OM risk was predicted by OM and breastfeeding histories and by daily environment outside the home.\nConclusions  New OM was associated with nasopharyngeal detection of all assayed viruses irrespective of the presence or absence of a concurrent CLI. Differences among viruses were noted, but statistical significance was not achieved, possibly because of the low power associated with the small number of nonrhinovirus detections.\nIt is well accepted that most new episodes of otitis media (OM) are temporally coincident with viral upper respiratory tract infections (vURTIs),1 and experimental evidence supports causality for this relationship.2-4 vURTIs may or may not present with a sign-symptom constellation recognized as a coldlike illness (CLI), and the results of some studies show that a CLI is not a prerequisite for the development of OM.5,6 Because vURTIs without CLI expression do not present clinically, most estimates of the frequency of all OM episodes attributable to vURTIs are calculated as the number of OM episodes divided by the number of CLI episodes and therefore are biased.\nPast studies report that more than 50% of all new OM episodes in children are temporally associated with a CLI,6,7 and conversely, that 20% to 40% of CLIs are associated with OM.8-11 Other studies reported the recovery of virus, virus protein, and viral genomic sequences from the middle ear in subjects with new-onset symptomatic OM (acute OM [AOM]) or persistent OM and related these findings to viral infection of the middle ear mucosa as the cause of those episodes.12-16 However, this interpretation can be questioned based on the results of other studies that reported recovery from the middle ear of genomic sequences for viruses that do not infect the upper respiratory tract but rather establish a persistent infection in other cell types (eg, human immunodeficiency virus, Epstein-Barr virus, cytomegalovirus, varicella-zoster virus, and herpes virus).17,18\nPerhaps as a consequence of the wide variety of study formats used to estimate OM-vURTI coincidence in children, the literature is inconsistent with respect to the relative importance of the different vURTI viruses.7,8,12,16,19-22 However, because most interventions that are potentially useful in preventing new OM during a vURTI are virus specific, unbiased estimates of virus-specific OM risk are needed.1,8 This study addresses that need using a longitudinal format with high-density assessments for detection of OM, CLI, and nasopharyngeal virus in a large group of unselected children. The null hypothesis tested is that the new OM coincidence rate of a vURTI is not virus specific. Acceptance or rejection of this hypothesis is important for developing rational strategies to prevent that complication.\nMethods\nThe data for this report were abstracted from those available for the first 4 years of an ongoing, 5-year study designed to characterize the causal relationships among vURTIs, CLIs, and OM in young children. The protocol was approved by the institutional review boards at the University of Pittsburgh and the University of Virginia. Families at 2 study sites (Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and Charlottesville, Virginia) with 2 children aged between 1 and 5 years were recruited for participation by advertisement. Exclusion criteria included the presence in either child of a serious medical condition, a medical condition that predisposes to persistent OM, a nonintact or structurally abnormal tympanic membrane, a preexisting sensorineural hearing loss, or an inability to cooperate sufficiently with the examination and test procedures. After affirmation of willingness to participate and acquisition of written informed consent, families were entered into the study in October with an anticipated follow-up through April of that year and were reimbursed for participation. The study subjects included the 2 index children and any older siblings younger than 10 years who provided assent.\nThe data for this report consist of demographic information for each child (age, sex, and race), information on selected OM risk factors (history of OM, frequent colds, breastfeeding, and exposure to tobacco smoke and the child's daily environment for a subset of children [those enrolled at the Pittsburgh site in years 1-4 and at the Charlottesville site in years 2-4]),23 the longitudinal daily assignments of the presence or absence of a CLI day as recorded by a parent and weekly assignments of the presence or absence of OM as assessed by bilateral pneumatic otoscopy performed by validated study personnel. These data were supplemented with virus detections by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay of nasal secretions collected from the children during a parent-identified CLI episode in the child or in an enrolled sibling, at the onset of a new OM episode (either unilateral or bilateral, asymptomatic or symptomatic) in the child or in a sibling, and at random times during illness-free periods. Not all samples during these designated target periods could be collected because some children refused at times to cooperate with the requisite procedures, and this was especially true when free nasal secretions were absent.\nFor each subject, parent-recorded CLI days were coded as longitudinal strings of 0s (CLI absent) and 1s (CLI present). A CLI episode was defined as 3 or more consecutive days with a parent-reported CLI separated from other episodes by at least 4 days. We did not provide the parents with a definition of a CLI day based on a specific symptom-sign set, and those assignments were made as was typical for each parent's usual CLI diagnosis in their children.\nBilateral pneumatic otoscopy on enrolled children was scheduled at approximately weekly intervals at an in-home visit (Pittsburgh) or at a study clinic visit (Charlottesville). At each observation time, both ears were examined by a validated otoscopist and classified as to the presence or absence of OM based on ratings of the tympanic membrane with respect to visibility, condition, position, appearance, color, vascularity, light reflex, and mobility. A positive diagnosis for OM was made when middle ear effusion (with or without air-fluid level) was observed irrespective of the presence or absence of concurrent signs of middle ear infection. Acute OM was diagnosed by the presence of OM with concurrent signs of middle ear infection including parental report of ear pulling, otalgia, irritability, and fussiness and otoscopic signs of erythema and/or white opacification (other than from scarring) of the tympanic membrane, bulging or fullness of the tympanic membrane, or otorrhea from a perforation of a previously intact tympanic membrane. Otitis media with effusion (OME) was assigned to OM episodes without concurrent signs of infection. Episodes of AOM but not OME were treated empirically with antibiotics. Because otoscopy was not necessarily performed at a time when the child first presented with otologic symptoms (the children were seen and treated by their primary care physician for most illnesses), subclassification of OM for this report was biased to OME assignment.\nOtoscopic data were coded for the left and right ears as OME present or absent (0 = absent; 1 = present), and AOM present or absent (0 = absent; 2 = present). Between otoscopic assessments, daily OM assignment for each ear was made based on that at the preceding visit, to yield a string of observations for each day of the study period. A new OME episode was defined as a sequence of 1s preceded and followed by a sequence of 0s, and an episode of AOM was defined as a newly introduced string of 2s, irrespective of preceding and subsequent observations. In the analysis, the child was considered to be the unit of measure, and either new unilateral or bilateral OM episodes were assigned as a new OM episode.\nThe technique for collecting nasal secretions from the children and the methods and protocols for storage and transport of the specimens to the virology laboratory were previously described.24 Samples were assayed in batches for PCR detection of adenovirus, coronavirus, influenza virus A and B, parainfluenza virus, rhinovirus (picornavirus), and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) using a protocol adapted from the commercially available Hexaplex procedure (Prodesse Inc, Waukesha, Wisconsin) as described in previous publications.6 Each viral species was assigned a numeric code, and the temporal distribution for these codes was overlaid onto the sequence strings for CLI and new OM episodes. Detections of the same virus within a 20-day period and without an intermittent observation of a different virus or \u201cno detectable virus\u201d were linked as a single virus detection. To avoid bias associated with multiple same-virus detections for a long-standing infection and bias associated with disproportionate representation of those children with a greater number of independent same-virus detections, the data analyses were based on the concurrence in each child of OM for the first detection of each assayed virus in isolation (ie, disregarding assays with multiple identified viruses).\nThe data map (longitudinal sequence strings for CLI, OM, and virus detections) was read from entry to termination of each child's participation, and the first detection of each assayed virus in isolation was identified. Associated new CLI and new OM episodes were assigned if the episode duration embedded the detection or occurred within 7 days after or 3 days before the virus detection. For the first detection of each virus in each child, the presence or absence of a new OM episode and of the OM subtype was assigned based on those criteria. Data for OM episodes of long durations and with multiple, nonidentical virus detections at different times were not included in the calculation of OM coincidence. For each virus, the OM coincidence rate of a first virus detection was calculated as the sum of all subjects of associated new OM detections for that virus divided by the number of individuals with virus detection for which the assignment could be made (eg, excluding episodes with multiple viruses, long-duration OM episodes, missing data for the virus detection interval). Results are presented as OM coincidence rates for each virus and the associated 95% confidence intervals. Comparisons among viruses of OM rates were performed using the \u03c72 or Fisher exact test.\nFor children with rhinovirus detections, the demographic and included risk factors were entered into a logistic regression equation to predict CLI coincidence and, with CLI as an additional variable, to predict OM coincidence. For each subject, the presence or absence of OM for all first virus detections was assigned. The predictor variables were entered into a stepwise regression equation to determine their contribution to this response variable.\nResults\nThe data for 213 children (176 white and 110 male) were available for analysis. These children ranged in age from 1.0 to 8.6 years (mean [SD] age, 3.7 [1.5] years); 63, 54, 60, and 36 different children were studied in years 1 through 4, respectively. Of these, 176 (81%) had at least 1 detection of an assayed virus; 114, 51, 6, 1, and 4 children had at least 1 detection of 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, respectively, of the assayed viruses. For each virus, the Table reports the number of persons with at least 1 detection, the number of first detections that were included in the calculation of OM coincidence rate, the number of associated new OM episodes, the number assigned to AOM, and the OM coincidence rate with 95% confidence intervals. At least 1 rhinovirus detection occurred in 70% of enrolled subjects, and new OM was coincident in 44% of the first detections. The other viruses were detected in less than 13% of the subjects, and the new OM coincidence rate varied from a low of 20% for influenza B virus to a high of 73% for influenza A virus detections. The difference in the OM coincidence rate among these viruses was not statistically significant (\u03c726 = 6.5; P = .37). However, the low detection frequency for most viruses greatly constrained the power of the statistical test. Nonetheless, with the exception of parainfluenza type 1 for which only 2 detections were observed, new OM episodes were coincident with the detection of all assayed virus species in the nose and/or nasopharynx.\nThe percentages of all associated OM episodes classified as AOM were 8%, 33%, 38%, 17%, 29%, and 75% for rhinovirus, RSV, influenza A virus, adenovirus, coronavirus, and parainfluenza virus, respectively. Pairwise comparisons of these percentages with rhinovirus were statistically significant for RSV (P = .02) and parainfluenza virus (P = .005) but was not significant for the other viruses (Fisher exact test).\nThe large number of isolated rhinovirus detections allowed for a comparison of OM coincidence between virus detections with and without a concurrent CLI. Of the 134 detections with data for both OM and CLI, 32 (24%) were not associated with either CLI or OM, 18 (13%) were associated with OM without CLI, 42 (31%) were associated with CLI without OM, and 42 (31%) were associated with both OM and CLI. Thus, for rhinovirus detections, 42 of 84 (50%) with and 18 of 50 (32%) without a concurrent CLI were associated with new OM (Fisher exact test, P = .15). For this subset, the OM risk of rhinovirus detection was 45% and of rhinovirus CLI was 50%.\nWhen the demographic variables (age, sex, and race), OM history (yes or no), frequent cold history (yes or no), breast feeding history (yes or no), exposure to tobacco smoke (yes or no), and daily environment (day care, school, or home with mother and/or father) were entered into a logistic regression equation to predict rhinovirus-associated CLIs (n = 121), only race (white > black; odds ratio, 0.31; P = .03) was a significant predictor. When these variables and CLI presence or absence were entered into the equation to predict rhinovirus-associated OM episodes, history of OM (present > absent; odds ratio, 2.6; P = .03), daily environment (out of home > home with mother and/or father; OR, 2.4; P = .03) and breastfeeding history (present > absent history; odds ratio, 3.7; P = .02) were identified as predictors. When these variables were entered into a stepwise regression equation to predict the frequency of OM episodes associated with any first virus detection for each subject (n = 137), history of OM (present > absent [P = .009]), daily environment (out of home > home with mother and/or father [P = .03]), and breastfeeding history (present > absent history [P < .001]) were again identified as significant predictors.\nComment\nThe results for the present study demonstrate temporal coincidences among CLI expression, new OM, and virus detection in the upper respiratory tract at rates consistent with those previously reported.9,10,21 While the observed relationships are associative, past studies of experimental vURTIs in adult human volunteers provide strong evidence for causality with vURTIs precipitating both CLI expression and otologic complications.2-4 As expected, most of the children (71%) had at least 1 rhinovirus detection, but the detection rates for the other assayed viruses were much lower, varying between 5% and 13%. This distribution is consistent with the results of studies focusing on the viral cause of CLIs with sampling over the typical CLI season.21\nFor rhinovirus, not all detections were associated with a CLI, and a CLI was not a prerequisite for OM development. While the OM coincidence rate was higher for CLI rhinovirus detections, this was not significant. Otologic complications in the absence of CLIs were previously reported for experimental vURTIs in adults5 and for natural vURTIs in children.25 These data suggest that the pathways activated during a vURTI leading to OM and to the symptoms and/or signs representing a CLI are somewhat independent.\nAn analysis of the possible predictors of CLI expression and new OM during rhinovirus detection showed that children identified by their parents as being white predicted CLI expression, while a positive history of OM, a positive history of breastfeeding, and a daily environment outside of the home predicted OM risk. The effect of OM history and daily environment on OM risk is consistent with previous reports, but the effect of breastfeeding is directionally opposed to that of past studies.23 It should be noted that previous studies of OM \u201crisk factors\u201d did not condition the enumerated OM events on virus presence (or, more weakly, on CLIs) as was done here for rhinovirus (and all viruses). These comparative results suggest that breastfeeding may be protective against vURTI but not against OM once virus infection is established; that negative OM history is protective against OM during established virus infections; and that daily environment at home with the mother and/or father protects against vURTIs and OM during established vURTIs.\nIn the present study, nasopharyngeal secretion samples were collected for virus assay in all enrolled siblings on the detection of OM (irrespective of concurrent otologic symptoms and/or signs) in any sibling, on the detection of a CLI in any sibling, and at random times throughout the typical CLI season. The rate of concurrent new OM varied from a low of 20% for influenza B to a high of 73% for influenza A, and the rate of OM episodes assigned to AOM was different among viruses, varying from a low of 8% for rhinovirus to a high of 75% for parainfluenza virus. Notably, OM was coincident with detection of all viruses assayed, but the differences among viruses in that rate did not achieve statistical significance. The latter may have resulted from low power, given the small sample sizes for nonrhinovirus detections and the uncontrolled differences in OM risk factors among the subpopulations with specific virus detections.\nPast studies reported an excess OM risk for RSV infections vis-\u00e0-vis infection with other viruses,7,8,12,19-21 but our results show that if a difference exists, its magnitude is small. Some of those studies were biased by design factors that included dependence on otologic signs and/or symptoms for OM identification (restricting the identified OM episodes to AOM, which our data show to be virus specific), the source population (eg, children in a hospital, where viruses that cause more serious complications such as RSV and influenza A would be overrepresented), and study season (eg, seasonal epidemics where viruses circulating at the time of sampling would be overrepresented). Reports that estimated coincidence rates from virus detections in the middle ear are especially vulnerable to these biases because the denominator for rate calculations (number infected with the virus in the population) is not known.\nIn conclusion, our null hypothesis that there are no differences in the new OM coincidence rates for different viruses could not be rejected. Overall, the OM coincidence rate for virus detection was 0.43. For most viruses, the 95% confidence interval placed on the OM rates was large, but for rhinovirus that interval was much smaller (0.36-0.53). Rhinovirus is the most common virus infection in children and, unlike some of the other viruses, children can be reinfected with a different strain of the virus in the same season. Combined with our data, these observations suggest that most new OM episodes are coincident with a rhinovirus vURTI. Because of the large number of rhinovirus stains, it is unlikely that a vaccine will be developed any time soon, and the effectiveness of the limited number of antipicornavirus agents (eg, interferon, pleconaril) available has not been evaluated with respect to preventing OM. A generalized approach to preventing OM episodes associated with a vURTI should target those events responsible for interpersonal virus transmission with the goal of preventing vURTIs in the at-risk population.\nCorrespondence: Cuneyt M.

This study was approved by the local institutional review board, and written informed consent was obtained from all patients. A detailed analysis of patient records was performed.\nAll patients underwent chest CT imaging. Real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests for COVID-19 nucleic acid were performed using nasopharyngeal swabs (Novel Coronavirus PCR Fluorescence Diagnostic Kit, BioGerm Medical Biotechnology).\nResults\nPatient 1 (presumed asymptomatic carrier), a 20-year-old woman, lives in Wuhan and traveled to Anyang on January 10, 2020. She initially met with patients 2 and 3 on January 10. On January 13, she accompanied 5 relatives (patients 2 through 6) to visit another hospitalized relative in Anyang District Hospital (Figure). There was no report of COVID-19 at this hospital. After development of disease in her relatives, patient 1 was isolated and observed. As of February 11, she had no elevated temperature measured or self-reported fever and no gastrointestinal or respiratory symptoms, including cough and sore throat, reported or observed by the physicians. Chest CT images on January 27 and 31 showed no significant abnormalities. Her C-reactive protein level and lymphocyte count were normal (Table). Results of RT-PCR testing were negative on January 26, positive on January 28, and negative on February 5 and 8.\nPatients 2 through 6 developed COVID-19. Four were women, and ages ranged from 42 to 57 years. None of the patients had visited Wuhan or been in contact with any other people who had traveled to Wuhan (except patient 1).\nPatients 2 through 5 developed fever and respiratory symptoms between January 23 and January 26 and were admitted to the hospital on the same day. All patients had RT-PCR test results positive for COVID-19 within 1 day. Patient 6 developed fever and sore throat on January 17 and went to the local clinic for treatment. There was no report of COVID-19 at the clinic. Her symptoms improved over the next few days but worsened on January 24, when she was admitted to the hospital and confirmed to have COVID-19 on January 26. Two patients developed severe pneumonia; the other infections were moderate.\nAll symptomatic patients had multifocal ground-glass opacities on chest CT, and 1 also had subsegmental areas of consolidation and fibrosis. All the symptomatic patients had increased C-reactive protein levels and reduced lymphocyte counts (Table).\nDiscussion\nA familial cluster of 5 patients with COVID-19 pneumonia in Anyang, China, had contact before their symptom onset with an asymptomatic family member who had traveled from the epidemic center of Wuhan. The sequence of events suggests that the coronavirus may have been transmitted by the asymptomatic carrier. The incubation period for patient 1 was 19 days, which is long but within the reported range of 0 to 24 days.4 Her first RT-PCR result was negative; false-negative results have been observed related to the quality of the kit, the collected sample, or performance of the test. RT-PCR has been widely deployed in diagnostic virology and has yielded few false-positive outcomes.5 Thus, her second RT-PCR result was unlikely to have been a false-positive and was used to define infection with the coronavirus that causes COVID-19.\nOne previous study reported an asymptomatic 10-year-old boy with COVID-19 infection, but he had abnormalities on chest CT.6 If the findings in this report of presumed transmission by an asymptomatic carrier are replicated, the prevention of COVID-19 infection would prove challenging. The mechanism by which asymptomatic carriers could acquire and transmit the coronavirus that causes COVID-19 requires further study.\nSection Editor: Jody W.

There is no current evidence that SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted through food consumption.\nHow Can I Stay Safe While Grocery Shopping?\nTo prevent transmission, maintain at least 6 feet of distance between yourself and other shoppers. Avoid shaking hands, hugs, or other physical contact. Try to wipe frequently touched surfaces like grocery carts or basket handles with disinfectant wipes, if available. Avoid touching your face. Wearing a cloth mask in the store may reduce your risk of getting infected and reminds others to participate in social distancing. Before leaving the store or while waiting in the checkout line, use hand sanitizer if available.\nAvoid shopping in public if you have symptoms such as fever or cough. If you are symptomatic, wearing a mask may help prevent transmission to others. Washing your hands frequently and maintaining distance between yourself and others are the best ways to prevent illness.\nWhat Precautions Should I Take When Unpacking Groceries?\nTime is on your side. Recent studies have shown that SARS-CoV-2 may remain infectious on surfaces or objects for up to 72 hours, but most virus on the surface of common materials becomes inactive (noninfectious) after the first 24 hours. There is limited evidence that virus particles on those products transmit disease. Virus on the surface of groceries will become inactivated over time after groceries are put away. The inner contents of sealed containers are unlikely to be contaminated. If using a disposable grocery bag, discard it once you are home. Reusable bags can be stored for later use. After unpacking your groceries, wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, or use hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol. Wipe surfaces with household disinfectants registered with the Environmental Protection Agency.\nWhat Precautions Should I Take When Preparing Food?\nIf you consume foods soon after unpacking your groceries, be sure to practice good hand hygiene before eating. Do not share plates or silverware with others. Rinse off fruits and vegetables thoroughly with water before consumption.\nAre There Any Additional Precautions for Older Adults?\nAdults older than 65 years and persons with chronic medical conditions are particularly vulnerable to severe disease from COVID-19. If possible, limit shopping in public. Ask a neighbor or friend to pick up groceries and leave them outside your house or bring them into the house while maintaining a distance of at least 6 feet.

SARS-CoV-2 is a type of coronavirus, which is a large family of viruses that cause illnesses ranging from the common cold to more severe infections in humans.\nCOVID-19 causes a variety of symptoms in people who are infected, and not all people infected with COVID-19 will have the same symptoms. Fever, dry cough, shortness of breath, fatigue, or body aches are some of the most common symptoms; however, some people have experienced headache, abdominal pain, diarrhea, and sore throat as well. Symptoms typically appear 2 to 14 days after exposure, although some patients may not develop symptoms until later.\nHow Is It spread?\nCurrent evidence suggests that the virus can be spread through respiratory droplets after an infected person coughs or sneezes, between people who are within about 6 feet of each other, and possibly through touching surfaces that have the virus on them, such as handrails, telephones, or doorknobs.\nHow Can I Prevent Infection Acquisition?\nWash your hands for at least 20 seconds with soap and water or hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol often (especially after touching common surface areas, using the bathroom, shaking hands, and other social interactions). Avoid large crowds, crowded public places, and maintain at least 6 feet of distance between yourself and others, especially if they are coughing or sneezing. This is known as social distancing. If you are older or have underlying medical problems, take extra care to avoid these situations, including nonessential air travel or cruises. Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands, because contaminated hands can transfer virus to these areas and make you sick. If you are sneezing or coughing, cover your mouth and dispose of tissues after used once. Avoid shaking hands when greeting others. Disinfect surfaces that are used regularly, using household sprays or wipes. Unless you have respiratory symptoms, are a health care worker, or are in close contact with or caring for someone with COVID-19, wearing a medical mask is not indicated. Wearing gloves in public is not effective protection from COVID-19, because gloves can be contaminated. Frequently washing your hands is the best way to protect yourself and your loved ones.\nFor More Information\nUS Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\nhttps://www.cdc.gov\nThe JAMA Patient Page is a public service of JAMA.

Confirmed cases in Korea were first reported on January 20, 2020, and spiked from February 20 to 29, 2020.1 Instead of deploying aggressive measures such as immigration control, lockdown, or roadblocks, South Korea mounted a trace, test, and treat strategy.2 This was made possible by the preparations that the country had made after the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) outbreak of 2015.\nSouth Korea extensively utilized the country\u2019s advanced information technology (IT) system for tracing individuals suspected to be infected or who had been in contact with an infected person. Such measures helped flatten the curve of newly confirmed cases and deaths around mid-March.1,2(pp4-5) As of April 21, 2020, there had been 10\u202f683 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in South Korea, with a total of 2233 patients who are in isolation because of hospitalization or quarantine, and a total of 237 deaths.3 However, important concerns have been raised over privacy involving the tracing strategy.\nLegal and Policy Responses\nIT-based epidemic containment strategies could include documentation, modeling, and contact tracing.4 To engage in documentation, the Korean government developed a customized app for quarantined individuals and required them to report their health status on a regular basis, and, with aggregated location data, modeling efforts were also made to locate potential sources of community-acquired infections. Korea\u2019s focus, however, has been on tracing infected individuals and also those who had been in contact with an infected individual. A major legal obstacle in deploying measures of contact tracing could have been Korea\u2019s stringent data privacy law.5 The Personal Information Protection Act (PIPA) of 2011 in principle bans the collection, use, and disclosure of personal data without prior informed consent of the individual whose data are involved.\nThe 2015 MERS outbreak, however, triggered amendments to the Contagious Disease Prevention and Control Act (CDPCA) and, with the amendments, the CDPCA was given authority to override certain provisions of the PIPA and other privacy laws. Thus, under the current CDPCA, public agencies including the Ministry of Health and Welfare (MOHW) and Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) can, at the outbreak of a serious infectious disease, collect, profile, and share 7 categories of data (Figure) that pertain to infected individuals or those suspected to be infected. Specifically, the data that can be collected include location data (including location data collected from mobile devices); personal identification information; medical and prescription records; immigration records; card transaction data for credit, debit, and prepaid cards; transit pass records for public transportation; and closed-circuit television (CCTV) footage.\nFigure.  Coronavirus Disease 2019 Contact Tracing in Korea: Sources, Categories, Collection, and Distribution of Data\nView LargeDownload\nIT indicates information technology.\nThe KCDC can share the data with central, municipal, or local governments, national health insurance agencies, and health care professionals and their associations. The KCDC must also transfer a part of the 7 categories of data (Figure), including immigration records, card transaction data, transit pass records, and CCTV footage, to national health insurance information systems and other designated systems. Based on this mandate and authority, in March 2020 the KCDC launched the COVID-19 Epidemiological Survey Prompt Support System for enhanced contact tracing. This system enabled prompt delivery of data pertaining to infected individuals to epidemiology investigators immediately after requisite data were collected from the police, mobile carriers, and credit card companies on a near real-time basis.\nFurthermore, at the outbreak of a serious infectious disease, the MOHW must promptly make publicly available on the internet or through a press release the following information: the path and means of transportation of infected persons; the medical institutions that treated infected persons; and the health status of those in contact with an infected person. The current disclosures on the MOHW home page include, in addition to these items, the sex, nationality, and age of infected persons, although their names are not revealed. Certain municipal and local governments, however, went further and provided highly detailed routes as well as the names of restaurants, shops, and other business premises that infected persons visited.\nPrivacy Controversies\nThe locations of infected individuals attracted extensive news coverage at times. For some cases, the general public engaged in profiling and unveiled or inferred embarrassing personal details. Reidentification allegedly took place on a few occasions. Some of these individuals were affected by unwanted privacy invasion and even became subject to public disdain. Restaurants, shops, and other business premises that infected individuals had visited often experienced abrupt loss of business. Concerns were raised regarding the uneven scope and granularity of disclosures by municipal and local governments.\nOn March 9, Korea\u2019s National Human Rights Commission issued a recommendation with a view to ameliorating privacy concerns, suggesting that the revelation of exceedingly detailed information was unwarranted. In response, on March 14, the KCDC issued a guideline to municipal and local governments, limiting the scope and detail of the information to be disclosed.\nToward a More Balanced Approach\nData sharing about infected individuals within the public sector and among medical professionals confers epidemiologic benefits. In containing the spread of a highly infectious disease like COVID-19, an early response is critical. The use of an integrated IT system helped epidemiology investigators save resources by automating the overall tracking processes. Because Korea was coping with a massive pandemic, it had a justifiable reason to collect and share data. After this unprecedented outbreak is over, however, the legal system could be further refined to facilitate the use of aggregated data rather than individual-level data to deter misuse of the data.\nIn particular, the specific epidemiologic benefits from extensive tracing and disclosure should be reassessed. For instance, determining the places an infected person has visited is important for epidemiologic reasons. However, rather than reveal those data to the public, the information could be used to disinfect the establishments and, that way, stigma and a decline in business could potentially be prevented. That is, rather than disclose precise locations of an infected individual to the general public, less granular data could be disclosed, with the same effect on tracking and quarantine. Concerns could be raised in the process regarding the lack of transparency from the government, and such concerns could be addressed by devising a suitable privacy-preserving methodology that ensures trustworthiness at the same time.6\nOther countries may try to develop systems similar to the one used in Korea. It is critical to balance the need for information to test, track, and quarantine with legitimate privacy concerns. The experience in Korea demonstrates the usefulness of an IT system in aggregating a wide range of both medical and nonmedical data in the process of containing the spread of a highly infectious disease. In doing so, the legal and technical infrastructure served as a crucial enabling factor. At the same time, certain adverse effects were observed from the measures used. Further refinements are needed to better protect the privacy of infected individuals while not sacrificing the effectiveness of the measures taken.\nBack to top\nArticle Information\nCorresponding Author: Haksoo Ko, JD, PhD, Seoul National University School of Law, Gwanak-ro 1 Gwanak-gu, Seoul 08826, Korea (hsk@snu.ac.kr).\nPublished Online: April 23, 2020. doi:10.1001/jama.2020.6602\nConflict of Interest Disclosures: Dr Ko reported receiving grants from the Research Fund of the Seoul National University Law Research Institute.

After longing for a baby for years, I finally found out I was carrying a life inside of me. As a second-year hematology-oncology fellow in a busy fellowship program, I knew that pregnancy would come with its own set of challenges, which I was prepared to face. Many of my predecessors had gone through this before, and I did not think the experience would be any different for me. What I was absolutely not prepared for was facing a pandemic while living and training in one of the most populous cities in the world during the time I was carrying my first child.\nIn late December, rumors started circulating about an unknown virus that originated in China. On December 31, a cluster of patients in China were identified who were associated with the seafood market in Wuhan1 and who had pneumonia associated with a novel coronavirus, also known as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).2 Data later indicated person-to-person transmission was occurring.3 At the time, no one seemed to have extensive concerns in the Western world. By late January 2020, the news regarding this novel coronavirus started spreading quickly in the media, and concern in the United States exponentially increased when reports emerged that the quickly and aggressively spreading virus had been reported in at least 21 countries.\nI remember the day when this new topic of conversation went from being a distant thought in my mind to a real concern. It was February 7, the day that the 33-year-old physician who weeks prior had raised concerns about a severe acute respiratory syndrome\u2013like virus at the Wuhan seafood market and was reprimanded for bringing up false news passed away from complications of the same virus. We later learned that on January 20, the first case of COVID-19 had been reported in the United States after a 35-year-old man who had returned from Wuhan, China, days prior presented to an urgent care clinic in Washington State with a 4-day history of cough and subjective fever. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention confirmed that results of his nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swab tests were positive for COVID-19.4 Meanwhile, more information became available regarding the virus itself, mode of transmission, vulnerable populations, and its complications, such as severe pneumonia, respiratory failure, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and cardiac injury, including fatal outcomes.5\nThe second week of February came, and with it my 3-month block of inpatient consult rotations and increasing fears of when the time would be that I would come face to face with the dangerous COVID-19. I kept repeating to myself that I am a healthy 31-year-old with no coexisting medical conditions and so I should be fine. But my medical knowledge intruded my thoughts and reminded me that pregnancy itself is considered an immunosuppressive state. Despite not wanting to, I started fearing not just for myself, but also for my unborn, still-developing baby who I had already grown so attached to.\nThen, on February 29, my biggest fear turned into a reality when New York State confirmed its first case. At that moment, I started preparing myself for potential consequences. In the following days I saw the numbers doubling and the amount of cases rising in a shocking manner. Paranoia crept inside of me when I first read how there were 89 people in quarantine being tested for the virus in Nassau County, where the hospital I work at is located. My thoughts kept fluctuating between a feeling of fear and my almost-reflexive sense of altruism, which is the very reason I chose this profession over others. I, like many others in my profession, have over the years developed a mindset that compels me to choose work over anything else.\nLike many others in my field, I often feel guilty even taking a sick day and have powered through my ailments in the past in an effort to help others. So I continued doing just that: pushing myself through overwhelming anxiety and continuing to go to work daily as the number of confirmed cases keep growing and the number of rule-outs were skyrocketing.\nMeanwhile, inside of my brain my maternal instincts continued to battle my physician instincts on a daily basis. A part of me would tell myself to ask one of my very supportive cofellows to cover during this period, and the other would say to persist and that I would be OK if I took the necessary precautions. However, the necessary precautions were not as simple as they sounded. Hospitals were running out of surgical masks and gowns. The supposedly disposable N95 masks were a rare commodity that people were claiming by writing their names on them and reusing several times over.\nWhile countries such as South Korea have been widely screening individuals even without symptoms, the United States is far behind in testing capabilities owing to major shortage of kits, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has recommended strict criteria for testing. Individual institutions are drafting their own algorithms and testing criteria to rule out other infections, such as influenza, prior to COVID-19 testing. However, there are now reports of patients getting coinfected with influenza and COVID-19. The Vienna International Centre recently reported a case of a female member of the cleaning staff who was initially diagnosed with influenza in early March and was later found to test positive for COVID-19 as well.6 Getting exposed to the virus is becoming more of a possibility as days go by. Becoming sick during pregnancy and the effect of the virus on my unborn baby are thoughts that I am actively trying to block out of my mind.\nSo far, there is very limited data on pregnancy and COVID-19 infection. One retrospective study7 discussed clinical characteristics of pregnant women infected with COVID-19 and possible transmission to the fetus. The study reported 9 pregnant patients with pneumonia who tested positive for COVID-19 infection. None of the patients developed severe COVID-19\u2013associated pneumonia or died. All 9 women gave birth to healthy newborns, and no cases of neonatal asphyxia was observed.\nA recently published study8 from Wuhan, China, evaluated 4 full-term infants born to pregnant mothers who tested positive for COVID-19. None of the 3 infants for whom consent was provided tested positive for the virus. None developed clinical symptoms at the time of discharge. However, in early February, an infected mother in China delivered a baby who tested positive for COVID-19 after birth.9 Recently, on March 14, there was a report10 of a second newborn baby who had reportedly tested positive for COVID-19 in London, England, minutes after delivery. The mother was diagnosed with pneumonia, and her positive test results were given after birth. To date, it is unclear if the virus was contracted in utero or after birth for both cases.\nFor a moment, I would like to believe that neither I nor my baby will get really sick from the virus based on these reports, but I cannot ignore the real chance that I or any of my colleagues working in health care might become a vector for the virus with minimal or no symptoms. As health care professionals, we all have to change our mindset and refrain from our reflexive attitude of pushing ourselves through illness because we could end up actually spreading disease to the very patients we are trying to help. What used to sound heroic before this pandemic has started to seem ironic to me now.\nIn conclusion, we are all in uncharted territories, some of us more than others. Living and working in this era of horrific pandemic while pregnant is definitely not easy, but faith in God and support from my family, friends, cofellows, and institutional leadership has gotten me this far, and I hope it will continue as I tread along. There is always a light at the end of the tunnel, and I have faith that this, like other pandemics in the past, shall pass and hopefully in the near future we will all look back optimistic and prideful about how we learned, united, overcame, and grew together from a situation like this.\nBack to top\nArticle Information\nCorresponding Author: Coral Olazagasti, MD, Zucker School of Medicine at Hofstra/Northwell Health, 450 Lakeville Road, New Hyde Park, NY 11042 (colazagasti@northwell.edu).\nPublished Online: April 24, 2020. doi:10.1001/jamaoncol.2020.1652\nConflict of Interest Disclosures: None reported.\nAdditional Contributions: This article reflects the first-person account of Dr Olazagasti.

In China, patients with COVID-19 were immediately isolated in designated existing hospitals, and new hospitals were rapidly built to manage the increasing numbers of cases in the most affected areas. Home quarantine for contacts was initiated and large gatherings were canceled. Additionally, community containment for approximately 40 million to 60 million residents was instituted. A significant positive association between the incidence of COVID-19 cases and mortality was apparent in the Chinese response.3 That is, the rapid escalation in the number of infections in China had resulted in insufficient health care resources, followed by an increase in mortality.\nThe association of mortality with health care resources should provide guidance for resource-limited regions on how and when to prepare for possible local outbreaks.3 In addition, lessons learned from the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) outbreak geared toward strengthening of public health systems will be helpful.\nCOVID-19 Preparedness in Africa\nLeaders have 2 important responsibilities in times of crisis: to solve the immediate problem and keep it from happening again.4 An African task force for coronavirus preparedness and response (AFTCOR) has been established, focusing on 6 work streams: laboratory diagnosis and subtyping; surveillance, including screening at points of entry and cross-border activities; infection prevention and control in health care facilities; clinical treatment of people with severe COVID-19; risk communication; and supply chain management and stockpiles.5 Should COVID-19 spread rapidly in Africa, most countries will not be able to afford large-scale diagnostics, although AFTCOR could increase this capacity to more than 40 African countries. Therefore, in the absence of testing, triage based on clinical case definition or presumptive diagnosis should be prioritized.\nCritical Care\nAt the height of the Chinese COVID-19 outbreak, the number of patients that required ventilatory support outnumbered the available intensive care unit (ICU) beds.6 General beds were rapidly converted to ICU beds and general hospitals were converted to critical care hospitals; additional physicians and nurses trained in critical care medicine were transferred to the most affected area. In Africa, ICU beds and personnel trained in critical care are limited to tertiary hospitals, as assessed in the Republic of The Gambia; therefore, mortality associated with COVID-19 is likely to exceed the reported case fatality rate of 2.3%.7 Furthermore, it is debatable whether low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) can fund the additional cost of critical care units from their limited health budgets.\nMinimum Requirements for Infection Prevention and Control\nBased on the World Health Organization (WHO) core components, the WHO infection prevention and control (IPC) minimum requirements are standards that should be in place at both national and health facility levels to provide minimum protection and safety to patients, health care workers, and visitors.8 The minimum requirements constitute the initial starting point for building additional critical elements of the IPC core components in a stepwise manner based on the local conditions. The COVID-19 outbreak has again demonstrated the importance of basic IPC measures and the importance of having these minimum requirements in place.\nThe disruption of supply chains and depletion of stock (such as medical supplies and equipment) in both high- and low-resource settings has catapulted IPC core component 8 (built environment, materials, and equipment for IPC) to daily front page headlines in the popular press and social media. Panic buying and irrational use of personal protective equipment (PPE) has led to inadequate supplies of N95 respirators, and these shortages will have potentially devastating consequences for multidrug-resistant/extreme drug\u2013resistant tuberculosis management in LMICs. To prevent shortages of essential PPE for the COVID-19 response, governments should give clear guidance on the use of PPE and act now to secure adequate supplies and stocks in case the outbreak spreads to these countries. Regional production of medical supplies should be considered for all continents to reduce the risks of shortages of PPE at crucial times.\nInfluence of Climate and Seasons\nMost cases of COVID-19 linked with local transmission have been identified in countries located in the northern hemisphere, which are in the winter \u201cflu\u201d season. Similarly, the SARS-CoV global outbreak in February 2003 did not affect Africa or South America on a large scale, suggesting that respiratory viruses spread more effectively in the winter and, therefore, the southern hemisphere will be affected later in the year, if at all. Climate-specific cultural differences (living more outdoors than indoors), the effect of UV light on the survival of the virus on surfaces, immunological differences of the population (innate immunity), preexposure with coronaviruses, or the higher temperatures could all have contributed. To date, all identified cases of COVID-19 in Africa originated from Europe and not from China.\nRefugees and Conflict Zones\nAccording to estimates from the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), the United Nations refugee agency, there are more than 41 million internally displaced people and 25 million displaced refugees globally, many of whom are living in LMICs. Large-scale refugee camps are situated in countries at risk for COVID-19, and these countries have limited resources to increase preparedness measures. Known comorbidities for COVID-19, such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, hypertension, and cancer, are often not properly controlled under these conditions. Health care systems in these camps are weak and access to health care facilities is limited9; thus, COVID-19 could have catastrophic consequences in these camps. Managing noncommunicable diseases and reducing the risk factors for COVID-19 in refugee camps is feasible, as was shown in a model of care for diabetes and hypertension by M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res in a Shatila refugee camp.10 Furthermore, triage and the implementation of minimum WHO IPC requirements should be initiated as part of COVID-19 preparedness in the existing health care facilities.\nMedia Partnerships\nThe West African (2014-2016) and Democratic Republic of the Congo (2019-2020) Ebola responses have demonstrated the negative effect of media resulting in suspicion of IPC measures and stigmatizing of patients. Both are crucial factors in public health responses. Social media can, and should, support public health responses both in preparedness and controlling the outbreak by teaming up with government in providing consistent, simple, and clear messages. It is evident how quickly both positive and negative messaging can influence the public. For example, images of spraying the environment with disinfectants should not be published to prevent misinformation. Correct, short, and motivational messages for communities are pivotal to support the acceptance and support of COVID-19\u2013specific IPC measures and quarantine legislation. In countries in which culturally appropriate messages, such as daily briefings, are delivered to the public, simple health messaging has greatly improved the confidence of the public in the government efforts to curtail the spread of this virus.\nConclusions\nChina has illustrated that the COVID-19 pandemic can be limited when public health outbreak response strategies and tactics are implemented early. In LMICs, IPC programs must be strengthened by ensuring that at least minimum requirements for IPC8 are in place as soon as possible, and media partnerships should be created to prevent societal fear.\nBack to top\nArticle Information\nCorresponding Author: Joost Hopman, MD, PhD, DTMH, Radboudumc Center for Infectious Diseases, Department of Medical Microbiology, Radboud University Medical Center, Geert Grooteplein 10, Postbus 9101, 6500 HB, Nijmegen, the Netherlands (joost.hopman@radboudumc.nl).\nPublished Online: March 16, 2020. doi:10.1001/jama.2020.4169\nConflict of Interest Disclosures: None reported.\nDisclaimer: The opinions expressed herein reflect the collective views of the coauthors and do not necessarily represent the official position of Radboud University Medical Center, M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res, Infection Control Africa Network, or the World Health Organization.

Among persons infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus that causes COVID-19, approximately 8% will require endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation.1\nAerosol-generating procedures have been described as \u201c\u2026procedures performed on patients [that] are more likely to generate higher concentrations of infectious respiratory aerosols than coughing, sneezing, talking, or breathing.\u201d2 Health Protection Scotland defines aerosol-generating procedures \u201cas medical and patient care procedures that result in the production of airborne particles (aerosols) that create the potential for airborne transmission of infections that may otherwise only be transmissible by the droplet route.\u201d3 Although there is no generally accepted and comprehensive list of aerosol-generating procedures performed during clinical care, examples include open suctioning of airways, sputum induction, manual ventilation, endotracheal intubation and extubation, noninvasive ventilation, bronchoscopy, and tracheotomy.4 There is great interest in understanding the hazards posed by the range of potentially hazardous aerosol-generating procedures for the transmission of COVID-19 and other infectious diseases.\nAmong the aerosol-generating procedures, performing endotracheal intubation is especially hazardous. The proceduralist performing endotracheal intubation is close to the patient\u2019s airway before, during, and after the procedure. The proceduralist is also likely to be present for the associated interventions that create respiratory aerosols, such as manual (bag) ventilation. A systematic literature review and meta-analysis that evaluated transmission of SARS coronavirus 1 (SARS-CoV-1) to health care personnel in association with exposure to aerosol-generating procedures found a significantly increased odds ratio of 6.6.5 This review also found an absolute risk increase of between 10% (cohort studies) and 15% (case-control studies) for transmission of SARS-CoV-1\u2013associated infection to health care personnel performing intubation.5 In addition, several other types of aerosol-generating procedures were also associated with increased risk for SARS-CoV-1, including tracheotomy, noninvasive ventilation, and manual ventilation prior to intubation.5 However, tracheal intubation was the procedure most consistently associated with transmission across the studies reviewed. Given that high viral loads of SARS-CoV-2 are found in sputum and upper respiratory secretions of patients with COVID-19, endotracheal intubation should also be viewed as a high-risk procedure for exposure to and transmission of SARS-CoV-2.6\nIn this issue of JAMA, Feldman et al7 reported the results of 2 simulations of endotracheal intubation using a fluorescent marker to visualize deposition of simulated exhaled respiratory secretions and material from the body surfaces of adult and pediatric manikins onto health care personnel performing or assisting in endotracheal intubation procedures. Personnel wore N95 respirators, eye protection, isolation gowns, and gloves. After the procedures, the investigators found fluorescent markers on the uncovered facial skin, hair, and shoes of the health care personnel performing the intubations. The authors concluded that the ensemble of personal protective equipment (PPE) used in the simulation may not fully prevent exposure of personnel performing endotracheal intubation in emergency department settings, although they acknowledged uncertainty about how generalizable the manikin studies are to intubations in actual patients.\nSeveral groups have developed guidance specific to protecting health care personnel involved in performing intubation procedures.6,8,9 In all cases, the guidance includes a comprehensive set of interventions, including elimination or substitution (eg, avoiding elective intubations of patients with COVID-19), engineering controls (eg, using intubation boxes as barriers to droplet spray, using antiviral filters between the face mask and the manual ventilation device, and performing procedures in airborne infection isolation rooms), administrative controls (eg, only essential personnel present during the procedures, and cleaning and disinfection of the room after the procedure), and use of PPE. Thus, the use of PPE is important, but it is only 1 part of the protective interventions that should be implemented to protect personnel who perform intubations. Published recommendations specifically focused on intubation include a UK consensus statement6 that notes the following about PPE: \u201cGeneral principles are that it should be simple to remove after use without contaminating the user and complex systems should be avoided. It should cover the whole upper body. It should be disposable whenever possible.\u2026Airborne precaution PPE is the minimal appropriate for all airway management of patients with known COVID-19 or those being managed as if they are infected.\u201d\nAn Australian consensus statement recommends that at a minimum PPE should include \u201cImpervious gown, theatre hat, N95 mask, face shield and eye protection, consider double gloves.\u201d8 The Chinese Society of Anesthesiology Task Force on Airway Management recommends \u201c\u2026fit-tested N95 masks, hair cover, protective coverall, gown, gloves, face shields and goggles, shoe covers. If available, medical protective head hood or powered air purifying respirator should be used. Goggles and glasses need to be prepared for anti-fog.\u201d9 Recommendations from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention10 and the World Health Organization11 cover a wide range of aerosol-generating procedures as opposed to being targeted specifically to endotracheal intubation. The PPE recommendations from the 2 organizations are similar, stating that those involved in aerosol-generating procedures wear an N95 or higher level respirator, eye protection, gloves, and a gown. This ensemble protects the surfaces where SARS-CoV-2 initiates infection (eyes, upper and lower respiratory tract) from the direct effects of droplet sprays and small particle aerosols.\nAs suggested in the study by Feldman et al,7 droplet sprays and aerosols can be deposited on uncovered sites such as skin on the face and neck; however, SARS-CoV-2 is not able to initiate infection at those sites. Infective material may be deposited into the susceptible tissues of the eyes, nose, or mouth via mechanisms such as hand transfer (ie, self-inoculation). This underscores the importance of maintaining consistent adherence to hand hygiene, including after removal of PPE. As part of standard precautions, any procedure that can be expected to generate splashes or sprays of infectious material should be performed using appropriate barriers to protect the operator (eg, a face shield that provides reliable protection from splashes from either side and below). Loose-fitting powered air-purifying respirators provide both high-level respiratory protection,12 as well as extensive facial and hair covering, and could be an effective and convenient alternative.\nIn addition, powered air-purifying respirators do not require fit testing and can be repeatedly disinfected and redonned.13 Any time skin or clothes become perceptibly contaminated with blood or body secretions during a procedure, the skin and hair should be cleaned with soap and water and clothes changed as soon as is feasible. Health care personnel should not wear soiled scrubs home from work.\nCOVID-19 has only been recognized as a disease for a few months, and much work is still needed to improve and refine protective efforts. Improved rapid identification of patients with COVID-1914 could help to ensure that protective precautions are used whenever needed and PPE is appropriately conserved during supply-chain shortages. Improved engineering controls providing barrier protection against droplet sprays and protection against small airborne particles generated during intubation procedures would be especially valuable. Identifying biomarkers of protective immunity to SARS-CoV-2 acquired in response to natural infection, or in the future, vaccination, might enable the administrative control of assigning individuals at lower risk for infection acquisition to selectively perform procedures associated with higher risks of exposure, such as intubation of patients with COVID-19.\nFundamental research is needed to better inform PPE recommendations. For example, it would be useful to know how long SARS-CoV-2 can remain infective on surfaces such as the skin, hair, and clothing, and the potential for contact transmission from those sites to guide recommendations for barrier protection. A better understanding of the duration of infectivity and level of risk posed by airborne SARS-CoV-2 would help to guide recommendations for respiratory protection. Much can be done to protect health care personnel performing endotracheal intubations from procedure-related transmission of COVID-19. Individuals who perform this life-saving procedure must be able to do it as safely as possible.\nBack to top\nArticle Information\nCorresponding Author: Lewis J.

Because there is currently no vaccine or treatment for the underlying infection, current health efforts are focused on providing prevention and screening, maintaining continuity of treatment for other chronic conditions, and ensuring access to appropriately intensive services for those with the most severe symptoms.1\nDisasters disproportionately affect poor and vulnerable populations, and patients with serious mental illness may be among the hardest hit. High rates of smoking in this population may raise the risk of infection and confer a worse prognosis among those who develop the illness.2 Residential instability and homelessness can raise the risk of infection and make it harder to identify, follow up, and treat those who are infected.3 Individuals with serious mental illnesses who are employed may have challenges taking time off from work and may lack sufficient insurance coverage to cover testing or treatment. Small social networks may limit opportunities to obtain support from friends and family members should individuals with serious mental illness become ill. Taken together, these factors may lead to elevated infection rates and worse prognoses in this population.\nWhat strategies are available to mitigate the outcome of this epidemic among patients with serious mental illness? Federal preparedness policies developed in the wake of complex disasters have increasingly embraced the notion of whole community preparedness, which supports building and supporting structures at multiple levels to prepare and respond, particularly for vulnerable populations.4 Within the public mental health care system, this includes engagement with mental health service users, clinicians, and federal and state policies.\nSupporting Patients With Serious Mental Illness\nPeople with serious mental illnesses should be provided with up-to-date, accurate information about strategies for mitigating risk and knowing when to seek medical treatment for COVID-19. Patient-facing materials developed for general populations will need to be tailored to address limited health literacy and challenges in implementing physical distancing recommendations because of poverty and unstable living situations. Messaging will need to provide assurances that those who seek care will not face penalties with regards to cost or immigration status. Patients will need support in maintaining healthy habits, including diet and physical activity, as well as self-management of chronic mental and physical health conditions.\nIt will also be important to address the psychological and social dimensions of this epidemic for patients. Worry could both exacerbate and be exacerbated by existing anxiety and depressive symptoms. Physical distancing strategies critical for mitigating the spread of disease may also increase the risk of loneliness and isolation in this population. Those who become ill may face dual stigma associated with their infections and their mental health conditions. For any given patient, psychological symptoms will emerge in a unique personal and social context that should be considered in developing a treatment plan.\nEmpowering Mental Health Clinicians\nMental health clinicians are often the primary point of contact with the broader health care system for their patients with serious mental illnesses, and as such will represent the first responders to the COVID-19 pandemic for many of these individuals. Mental health clinicians need training to recognize the signs and symptoms of this illness and develop knowledge about basic strategies to mitigate the spread of disease for both in their patients and themselves. Clinicians should have discussions with their patients about how best to implement the strategies.\nClinicians will need support in maintaining their own safety and well-being. Where possible, services should be delivered via telehealth rather than in person, and when in-person visits are necessary, in individual rather than group formats. Child and elder care should be made available for mental health clinicians working extra shifts. Support from colleagues will be essential for maintaining physical, mental, and social well-being, particularly if the pandemic is of an extended duration.\nStrengthening Mental Health Care Systems\nThe COVID-19 pandemic is likely to place a major strain on community mental health centers and state psychiatric hospitals. These facilities have limited capacity to screen for or treat medical conditions, and few have existing relationships with local or state public health agencies. It is critical for these organizations to develop continuity-of-operations plans to ensure that they can maintain vital functions in the face of staff illnesses or shortages of psychotropic medications. Clinics will need protocols for identifying and referring patients at risk for infection and self-quarantine strategies for clinicians who develop symptoms of the illness. Adequate environmental protections including well-ventilated spaces, easy access to handwashing, and personal protective equipment should be available. Institutional settings, including state psychiatric hospitals, nursing homes, and long-term care facilities, will be at particularly high risk for outbreaks and need to ensure that they have contingency plans to detect and contain them if they occur.\nExpanding Mental Health Policies\nThe coming weeks will see a wave of new federal legislation and regulations and state policies developed to mitigate the health and economic outcomes of the COVID-19 outbreak.5 These policies will have particular urgency for populations with serious mental illness because of their elevated risks. State mental health authorities will play a critical role in creating and administering policies regarding COVID-19 in their state hospitals and community mental health clinics. The role of social policies, such as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, housing support, and paid sick leave for hourly employees will be vital for ensuring the health and well-being of this population.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic will create unprecedented health and social challenges both in the US and internationally. People with serious mental illnesses will be at uniquely high risk during this period, as will be the public mental health care system central to delivering their care. Careful planning and execution at multiple levels will be essential for minimizing the adverse outcomes of this pandemic for this vulnerable population.\nBack to top\nArticle Information\nCorresponding Author: Benjamin G.

Although the portal for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is inhalational, and alveolar infiltrates are commonly found on chest x-ray or computed tomography (CT) scan, the respiratory distress appears to include an important vascular insult that potentially mandates a different treatment approach than customarily applied for ARDS. Indeed, the wide variation in mortality rates across different intensive care units raises the possibility that the approach to ventilatory management could be contributing to outcome.1-3\nCOVID-19 is a systemic disease that primarily injures the vascular endothelium. If not expertly and individually managed with consideration of the vasocentric features, a COVID-19 patient with ARDS (\u201cCARDS\u201d) may eventually develop multiorgan failure, even when not of advanced age or predisposed by preexisting comorbidity.\nStandard Approaches to Ventilating ARDS\nNormally, ARDS is characterized by noncardiogenic pulmonary edema, shunt-related hypoxemia, and reduced aerated lung size (\u201cbaby lung\u201d), which accounts for low respiratory compliance.4 In such settings, increasing lung size by recruiting previously collapsed lung units is often achieved through the use of high levels of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP), recruiting maneuvers, and prone positioning. Because high transpulmonary pressure induces stress across the lung that is poorly tolerated in ARDS, relatively low tidal volumes, together with tolerance for modest (permissive) hypercapnia, facilitate the goal of minimizing ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI). Indeed, in the early phases of ARDS, before a patient has fatigued or been sedated, the high transpulmonary pressures associated with spontaneous vigorous inspiratory effort may contribute to damage (so-called patient self-induced lung injury [P-SILI]).5\nClinical Features of CARDS\nSoon after onset of respiratory distress from COVID, patients initially retain relatively good compliance despite very poor oxygenation.1,2 Minute ventilation is characteristically high. Infiltrates are often limited in extent and, initially, are usually characterized by a ground-glass pattern on CT that signifies interstitial rather than alveolar edema. Many patients do not appear overtly dyspneic. These patients can be assigned, in a simplified model, to \u201ctype L,\u201d characterized by low lung elastance (high compliance), lower lung weight as estimated by CT scan, and low response to PEEP.6 For many patients, the disease may stabilize at this stage without deterioration while others, either because of disease severity and host response or suboptimal management, may transition to a clinical picture more characteristic of typical ARDS. These can be defined as \u201ctype H,\u201d with extensive CT consolidations, high elastance (low compliance), higher lung weight, and high PEEP response. Clearly, types L and H are the conceptual extremes of a spectrum that includes intermediate stages, in which their characteristics may overlap. Another feature consistently reported is a highly activated coagulation cascade, with widespread micro- and macro-thromboses in the lung and in other organs (eFigure 1 in the Supplement); very elevated serum D-dimer levels are a consistent finding associated with adverse outcomes.7\nThese observations indicate the fundamental roles played by disproportionate endothelial damage that disrupts pulmonary vasoregulation, promotes ventilation-perfusion mismatch (the primary cause of initial hypoxemia), and fosters thrombogenesis. In addition, remarkably increased respiratory drive may, if unchecked, intensify tidal strains and energy loads from a patient\u2019s respiratory effort applied to highly vulnerable tissue, adding P-SILI to the mix of the lung\u2019s inflammatory assault.5,8 When confronting such an unfamiliar and rapidly evolving environment, only certain aspects of well-accepted lung-protective approaches to ARDS remain rational at these different stages. More important, inattention to the vascular side (eg, avoidance of fluid overload, reduction of cardiac output demands) could inadvertently promote counterproductive responses (eg, edema) and iatrogenic damage.\nProtecting the CARDS Lung\nPatients with type L CARDS, having good lung compliance, accept larger tidal volumes (7-8 mL/kg ideal body weight) than those customarily prescribed for ARDS without worsening the risk of VILI. Actually, in a 70-kg man, with respiratory system compliance of 50 mL/cm H2O and PEEP of 10 cm H2O, a tidal volume of 8 mL/kg yields a plateau pressure of 21 cm H2O and driving pressure of 11 cm H2O, both well below the currently accepted thresholds for VILI protection (30 and 15 cm H2O, respectively). Higher VT could help avoid reabsorption atelectasis and hypercapnia due to hypoventilation with lower tidal volumes.\nThe key issue in this early stage is disrupted vasoregulation, where the pulmonary vasoconstriction that normally occurs in response to hypoxia fails to occur because of an endothelial assault that mismatches perfusion to ventilation and may result in profound hypoxemia. The clinician\u2019s first response, boosting Fio2, may indeed prove effective early on. If insufficient, noninvasive support (eg, high-flow nasal O2, CPAP, Bi-PAP) may stabilize the clinical course in mild cases, provided that the patient does not exert excessive inspiratory efforts. However, if respiratory drive is not reduced by oxygen administration and noninvasive support, persistently strong spontaneous inspiratory efforts simultaneously increase tissue stresses and raise pulmonary transvascular pressures, vascular flows, and fluid leakage (ie, P-SILI).8-10 Progressive deterioration of lung function (a VILI vortex) may then rapidly ensue. Early intubation, effective sedation, and/or paralysis may interrupt this cycle. Targeting lower PEEP (8-10 cm H2O) is appropriate. Raising mean transpulmonary pressures by higher PEEP or inspiratory-expiratory ratio inversion redirects blood flow away from overstretched open airspaces, accentuating stresses on highly permeable microvessels and compromising CO2 exchange without the benefit of widespread recruitment of functional lung units.\nIf lung edema increases in the type L patient, either because of the disease itself and/or P-SILI, the baby lung shrinks further, and the type H phenotype progressively develops. Concentrating the entire ventilation workload on an already overtaxed baby lung increases its power exposure and blood flow, thereby accentuating its potential for progressive injury.\nThere are 2 major contributors to this VILI vortex of shrinking the baby lung: airspace VILI8 and intensified stresses within the vessels that perfuse it9,10 (eFigure 2 in the Supplement). Over time, superimposed VILI and unchecked viral disease incite inflammation and edema, promoting local and generalized thrombogenesis, intense cytokine release, right ventricular overload, and systemic organ dysfunction. In this advanced state, it is advisable to apply a more conventional lung-protective strategy: higher PEEP (\u226415 cm H2O), lower tidal volume (6 mL/kg), and prone positioning while minimizing oxygen consumption. Whichever the disease type, weaning should be undertaken cautiously (Table).\nTable.

Worldwide, more than 100\u202f000 cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2) and more than 3500 deaths have been reported. COVID-19 is thought to have higher mortality than seasonal influenza, even as wide variation is reported. While the World Health Organization (WHO) estimates global mortality at 3.4%, South Korea has noted mortality of about 0.6%.1-3\nVaccine development and research into medical treatment for COVID-19 are under way, but are many months away. Meanwhile, the pressure on the global health care workforce continues to intensify. This pressure takes 2 forms. The first is the potentially overwhelming burden of illnesses that stresses health system capacity and the second is the adverse effects on health care workers, including the risk of infection.\nIn China, an estimated 3000 health care workers have been infected and at least 22 have died. Transmission to family members is widely reported. Despite recognition that transmission occurs mostly via symptomatic individuals, there are reports of asymptomatic individuals who transmitted the disease to multiple family members.4 These reports underscore the need for prevention of cross-infection. Evidence related to transmissibility and mortality inform the clinical community of the importance of vigilance, preparation, active management, and protection.\nAdherence to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s (CDC) recommended guidelines advances safety.5 SARS-CoV-2 is spread by droplet and contact. It is not principally an airborne virus. Therefore, ensuring routine droplet barrier precautions, environmental hygiene, and overall sound infection prevention practice is indicated. To ensure minimal risk of infection when treating patients with COVID-19, the CDC recommends the use of personal protective equipment including a gown, gloves, and either an N95 respirator plus a face shield/goggles or a powered, air-purifying respirator (PAPR). However, airborne precautions are not used in daily, routine care of patients with general respiratory illness.\nThe widespread use of recommended barrier precautions (such as masks, gloves, gowns, and eye wear) in the care of all patients with respiratory symptoms must be of highest priority. In emergency departments, outpatient offices, homes, and other settings, there will be undiagnosed but infected patients, many with clinically mild cases or atypical presentations. There is limited availability of N95 masks, respiratory isolation rooms, and PAPR, particularly in outpatient offices, to feasibly evaluate every patient with respiratory illness and such measures are not routinely necessary.\nProtection is achievable even without N95 masks or PAPR. In a study of outpatient health care personnel in diverse ambulatory practices, medical masks applied to both patient and caregiver provided effectively similar protection as N95 masks in the incidence of laboratory-confirmed influenza among caregivers who were routinely exposed to patients with respiratory viruses.6 Adherence to CDC evidence-based guidelines for masks, hand hygiene, and environmental hygiene enhances the safety for health care workers.\nMany additional questions and concerns remain, especially in high-risk sites and clinical settings. One problem is in the emergency department, where crowding is identified as a major concern. Rigor in the use of recommended precautions for all patients with respiratory illness is especially important. Placing a facemask on the patient at arrival, supplying tissues, promoting cough etiquette, and providing for hand hygiene and surface decontamination are all important steps. Those patients with symptoms of suspected COVID-19 should be rapidly triaged and separated from the general population ideally in a well-ventilated space with a distance of at least 6 feet from others until they can be placed in an isolation room. Caregivers who encounter any patient with respiratory illness should wear a mask and gloves, with goggles as recommended. Even when COVID-19 is not suspected, it may be present so routine use of these precautions and increased environmental and personal hygiene is advised. Strict adherence to guidelines is of elevated importance for the protection of health care workers. A focus on worker protection through specific training and encouragement of adherence to barrier precautions and hygiene recommendations may help provide a priority focus. Telling caregivers to focus on their safety and being clear and specific about how to do so can promote calm during an epidemic.\nIn addition to recommended masks for patients and other barrier precautions, enhanced hand hygiene and surface decontamination are key to safety. The coronavirus is known to live on surfaces for hours or days,7 but it is also effectively killed by available disinfectants when properly used. Masks, goggles, gloves, and other barrier precautions will fail to protect caregivers who later encounter contaminated surfaces and fail to wash their hands. Health care personnel must focus on meticulous hand hygiene, avoiding contaminating workspaces. Clinical staff should clean workspaces and personal items such as stethoscopes, mobile phones, keyboards, dictation devices, landlines, nametags, and other items with hospital-provided disinfectants or alcohol-based disinfectants.5 It is sensible for environmental services workers to increase the frequency of cleaning of commonly touched surfaces such as light switches, countertops, chair arms, escalator railings, elevator buttons, doorknobs, and handles. Active decontamination is not merely a technical issue, it also is reassuring to stressed and concerned caregivers, patients, and visitors.\nThe consequences of delayed recognition of a patient with COVID-19 are significant. Contact tracing for exposure to a case of COVID-19 is no longer routinely recommended, so health care workers must consider themselves at elevated risk of exposure. Health care workers must self-monitor, report signs of illness, and not engage in patient care while exhibiting infectious symptoms.\nRecognizing that symptoms of COVID-19 may be mild, the development of pragmatic policies for health care workers who have respiratory illness should be considered. When health care workers exhibit respiratory symptoms, they should not provide direct patient care. When testing, vaccination, and treatments become available, the health care workforce should be considered a priority for evaluation and treatment. Because workforce safety is a high priority, active training in the proper use of barrier precautions and hygiene practices is important.\nMany health care workers have conditions that elevate risk for severe infection or death if they become infected with COVID-19, so organizations will need to decide whether such workers, including physicians, should be redeployed away from the highest risk sites. It is not possible to entirely eliminate risk, but prudent adjustments may be warranted. New sites may need physician and nurse expertise, including telemedicine services, patient advice lines, and augmented telephone triage systems.\nRecognizing the risk of health care worker shortages, organizations are banning travel to medical meetings, canceling conferences, limiting nonessential travel, and recommending that personal travel be curtailed. The travel restrictions are not just to affected regions but to domestic and international sites to keep caregivers close and available. Avoiding travel and crowds may also decrease risk of infection.\nWhile health care workers often accept increased risk of infection, as part of their chosen profession, they often exhibit concern about family transmission, especially involving family members who are elderly, immunocompromised, or have chronic medical conditions. While the CDC and Occupational Safety and Health Administration provide clear recommendations, it is evident that more is required to optimize safety in the current environment. Health care workers may ask whether their family members can receive priority for testing, vaccination, and treatment when the testing becomes available. Ensuring care of health care workers\u2019 family members would enhance workforce confidence and availability, but the feasibility and advisability of family priority is yet to be determined. For front-line caregivers, the concerns about transmitting the virus to family members will need to be addressed.\nConversations with front-line caregivers may help reduce anxiety. Topics for discussion might include protective planning for the home such as separation of living spaces and bathrooms and when such separation should be implemented. Protocols for routine arrival home after duty will be a point of discussion, including the benefits of taking off shoes, removing and washing clothing, and immediately showering. These protocols are optional because evidence is unclear, but they may be sensible. Some discussion might be given to changing from personal clothing to hospital-supplied scrubs on arrival to work and changing back to personal clothes to return home. Facility experts may provide guidance about home surface decontamination, including effective products and techniques. There is a need to strike a balance, however, because these ideas might increase anxiety among overworked caregivers. Long work hours make any additional home preparations and extra home cleaning a significant challenge. On the other hand, it can be sensible and reassuring. The focus should be on supportive conversations, clear guidance when recommendations exist, attempts to minimize misinformation, and efforts to reduce anxiety.\nHospital personnel, including caregivers, support staff, administration, and preparedness teams, all will be stressed by the challenges of a prolonged response to COVID-19, and leadership must emphasize the importance of self-care as the center of the response. Transparent and thoughtful communication could contribute to trust and a sense of control. Ensuring that workers feel they get adequate rest, are able to tend to critical personal needs (such as care of an older family member), and are supported both as health care professionals and as individuals will help maintain individual and team performance over the long run. Liberating clinicians and administrative team members from other tasks and commitments allows them to focus on the immediate needs. Provision of food, rest breaks, decompression time, and adequate time off may be as important as provision of protocols and protective equipment as days turn into weeks, then months. Frequent information and feedback sessions with local managers and the broader facility community, complemented by clear, concise, and measured communication, will help teams stay focused on care and secure in their roles.\nBack to top\nArticle Information\nCorresponding Author: James G.

The problem has become increasingly urgent as a growing number of incarcerated individuals and prison workers test positive for coronavirus infection.\nThe United States incarcerates nearly 2.2 million people in jails or prisons\u2014more than any other nation\u2014and reports of detainees and jail and prison workers who have contracted COVID-19 are becoming increasingly frequent. In Chicago, for example, the Cook County Sheriff\u2019s office noted that as of April 5, 234 detainees had tested positive, 14 of whom were hospitalized, and 78 employees had also tested positive. Last week, the New York Times reported that in New York City\u2019s jails, including the Rikers Island complex, 167 inmates, 23 health workers, and 114 corrections staff (2 of whom have died) had tested positive.\nVulnerability of Incarcerated Populations\nJail and prison populations are exceptionally vulnerable to COVID-19 for a variety of reasons, including older age and health status, as well as conditions such as overcrowding and limited access to or poor quality of health care while incarcerated. More than 10% of inmates of US state and federal prisons are 55 years or older, and many have chronic or life-limiting illnesses. Approximately 15% of inmates of state prisons reported ever having asthma and 10% reported ever having a heart disorder\u2014conditions that put individuals at high risk for severe illness with COVID-19.\nIn addition to physical vulnerability, overcrowding and sanitation issues in many jail and prison settings heighten the risk of disease spread and are in stark contrast to the recommendations of public health officials for social distancing, frequent handwashing, and other practices for COVID-19 prevention.\nAccording to a 2019 report on global prison trends, there are more than 10 million men, women, and children in jails and prison, and such facilities are overcrowded in at least 121 countries. Space for social distancing is inadequate or nonexistent. Limited access to soap and water may make frequent handwashing impossible, and hand sanitizer may be off limits because of its high alcohol content. Inmates in some facilities must pay for their own soap and personal hygiene items and may be charged copays for medical visits that they may not be able to afford.\nAddressing the situation is crucial because of the risks COVID-19 poses not only to incarcerated people but also to the general population. Jails, which by their nature are transient facilities, have the potential to accelerate spread because of their enormous turnover, as people are locked up and then released again into the community. In an analysis of a database of county- and jurisdiction-level jail populations, the Marshall Project (a nonprofit news organization covering the US criminal justice system) and the New York Times found that, based on 2017 data, approximately 200\u202f000 people typically flow into and out of jails every week.\nQuarantines and Releases\nIn response to the growing number of quarantine and isolation cases in federal facilities, the US Bureau of Prisons announced that to mitigate COVID-19 exposure and spread, all 146\u202f000 persons incarcerated in federal facilities would be under quarantine (that is, confined to their cells), effective April 1, for 14 days. The Bureau said that to \u201cthe extent practicable,\u201d inmates would still have access to programs and services that are normally offered, such as mental health and educational services, and that they would be able to access communal areas (such as for showers and telephone and computer access).\nHowever, Rep Jerrold Nadler (D, New York) and others urged more aggressive measures to address the problem, including releasing older and medically vulnerable or pregnant prisoners. Last Friday, US Attorney General William P. Barr directed the Bureau of Prisons to expand the group of inmates at federal prisons eligible for early release, particularly at correctional institutions in Louisiana, Connecticut, and Ohio, where the largest numbers of inmates and staff members have tested positive for COVID-19.\nFacilities in California, New York, Ohio, Texas, and elsewhere have also granted early release to thousands of inmates, such as lower-level, nonviolent offenders and elderly or medically fragile individuals, from state and local facilities. In many cases, the released inmates are homeless, and authorities are scrambling for alternatives. California and New York City are leasing hotel rooms so homeless people released from jail don\u2019t accelerate the pandemic.\nAlthough the United States is unique with respect to the size of its incarcerated population, the threat COVID-19 poses to prison populations and staff is universal, and other countries are similarly working to mitigate risk. For example, jails and prisons in Australia, Canada, England, France, Ireland, Germany, Northern Ireland, Scotland, and Wales have released prisoners early or are considering doing so.\nGuidelines released last month by the World Health Organization outline measures that prisons and other detention facilities (such as immigration detention settings) should take. These guidelines include considering noncustodial measures at all stages of the criminal justice process as well as screening all individuals upon admission for fever and lower respiratory tract symptoms\u2014and possibly medically isolating them pending further evaluation.\n\u201cEfforts to control COVID-19 in the community are likely to fail if strong infection prevention and control (IPC) measures, adequate testing, treatment and care are not carried out in prisons and other places of detention as well,\u201d the guidelines note.", "jamahealthforum.2020.0499": "As state governments continue to focus on mitigating further spread of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus through stay-in-place orders, building a national COVID-19 surveillance system is crucial for containing transmission of the virus now and preparing for future waves of the infection, according to a new report issued by the Duke-Margolis Center for Health Policy.\n\u201cAt the same time that we confront the current crisis, we must plan for the future by putting in place tools to enhance our ability to conduct effective surveillance, containment, and case management,\u201d noted the reports\u2019 authors, a team of 5 experts in the health care arena, including 2 former US Food and Drug Administration commissioners, Mark McClellan, MD, PhD, and Scott Gottlieb, MD; and Farzad Mostashari, MD, MSc, former national coordinator for health information technology at the Department of Health and Human Services. \u201cThere is no time to lose.\u201d\nCase-based interventions\u2014case detection, contact tracing, and isolation\u2014will become an option as incidence of COVID-19 declines, and building capabilities to use such interventions will help the country move beyond the stay-at-home rules and intensive physical distancing measures that became necessary as COVID-19 swept across the United States, they said.\nAccording to the report, A National COVID-19 Surveillance System: Achieving Containment, implementing such a surveillance system will require ongoing coordination by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and collaboration between the CDC and local and state public health authorities. On state and local levels, every region of the country should aim for key outbreak surveillance and response capabilities: a test-and-trace infrastructure, real-time syndromic surveillance, serologic testing for markers of infection, and rapid response in the form of isolation, contact tracing, and quarantine.\nTest-and-Trace Infrastructure\nCOVID-19 case detection, contact tracing, and isolation are the foundation for minimizing the risk of new outbreaks while easing community restrictions, the report said. This would entail having the capacity to conduct rapid, widespread diagnostic testing for every individual with COVID-19 symptoms as well as for health care workers and others at high risk of contracting or transmitting the virus.\nTo enable early identification of small outbreaks, an important component of the test-and-trace infrastructure would be a robust regional sentinel surveillance system that would routinely monitor sample populations, particularly vulnerable populations or those in congregate settings. In addition, states and localities must be able to share data electronically, to enable prompt intervention when new cases are detected.\nCurrently, however, none of the 50 states has sufficient surveillance capabilities to allow case-based interventions at the necessary scale. \u201cWith Federal support, surveillance mechanisms can be increased or implemented and better integrated with testing by providers,\u201d the report said.\nThe authors suggest that a \u201creasonable first approach\u201d is to support a pilot program in regions that are already working to improve surveillance capabilities. Massachusetts, for example, has a new initiative to hire and train 1000 individuals to improve contact tracing efforts. What can be learned from successful early models and best practices would inform guidance from the CDC to scale up these capabilities throughout the United States.\nReal-Time Surveillance\nAnother essential component of containing COVID-19 is an enhanced national syndromic surveillance system that integrates COVID-19 test-and-trace data. Syndromic surveillance provides a system for timely detection and monitoring of infectious disease outbreaks and other health events. Tracking symptoms of patients visiting emergency departments, for example, can reveal unusual levels of illness that may provide an early warning for public health concerns, such as influenza outbreaks.\nA syndromic surveillance system\u2014including timely access to a range of health-related data across the country, such as electronic feeds of data on hospital admissions, discharges, and transfers\u2014would allow public health officials to monitor spikes and falls in potential COVID-19\u2013related symptoms.\nSystems established over the past decade allow for real-time monitoring of a sample of emergency department visits for influenza-like illness and other syndromes of interest. The report noted that in California, New York, and Washington, early experiences with COVID-19 suggest that building on such systems can provide indicators of COVID-19 trends.\nThis infrastructure for data collection and analysis \u201cshould be enhanced to provide additional support for COVID-19 decision making,\u201d the report noted, including prioritizing measures that can provide early signals of community outbreaks.\nSerologic Testing\nAlso needed is the capacity to conduct widespread serologic testing to identify reliable markers of exposure and immunity. \u201cAt the population level, a rigorous large-scale community serosurvey is urgently required to understand the true extent of COVID-19 infections, with important implications for calibrating epidemic models,\u201d the authors said. This would allow an accurate assessment of the fatality rate and the extent to which children are susceptible to infection.\nHowever, they note that questions about the completeness and durability of immunity remain unsettled and will need to be answered before serostatus can be a useful guide for such issues as which individuals may be able to safely return to work.\nRapid Response\nCurrently, the capacity of local public health authorities to respond to the data generated by the surveillance activities is \u201cvery limited,\u201d the report said. That means that health systems and public health officials need to scale up capacity to rapidly isolate newly identified COVID-19 cases, conduct contact tracing, and quarantine contacts. \u201cImproved capacity will be most effective if coordinated with health care providers, health systems, and health plans and supported by timely electronic data sharing,\u201d they noted.\nTo avoid burdening health care facilities and presenting any potential contagion risks, the authors also recommend increasing the capacity to treat new COVID-19 cases effectively at home or in local isolation facilities whenever possible. \u201cThe CDC-led collaboration, working with [the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services], private payers, and providers, should support the identification of approaches, best practices, and supporting tools to expand effective COVID-19 case management models,\u201d the report noted.", "jama.2020.3413": "I\nn late December 2019, a cluster of unexplained cases of viral pneumonia occurred in Wuhan, China.1 This initial cluster of patients with what soon became known as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) heralded the arrival of a new pandemic caused by a novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). To date, close to 90\u202f000 cases have occurred in more than 60 countries with approximately 3000 deaths. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared these events a Public Health Emergency of International Concern.\nIt is expected that a COVID-19 vaccine will take 12 to 18 months to develop and manufacture, and even then it may not be effective. Therapeutics might be developed much more quickly, with clinical trials already under way, but it is too soon to know when such therapies might be available. There are still many uncertainties regarding COVID-19, including the number of asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic cases in China and other countries, the overall attack rate in the population, and the ultimate case-fatality rate in different countries around the world.\nDespite these uncertainties, it is clear that COVID-19 is a dangerous new epidemic. Given this, important actions need to be taken to prepare the US health care sector for COVID-19 and to aim to slow the spread of disease through public health interventions.\nReview and Update Preparedness Plans Developed for Earlier Epidemics\nIn the spring of 2009, the appearance of novel influenza A(H1N1) was linked to reports of severe disease. No specific vaccine was available\u2014vaccine was only available after the peak of infection had passed\u2014and there were many questions about the trajectory of the outbreak. Governments, hospitals, and businesses had been preparing for a pandemic for several years following the SARS epidemic in 2003 and the avian influenza A(H5N1) epidemic in 2005.\nIn 2009, pandemic influenza plans were activated, hospitals experienced a large surge of patients in emergency departments and intensive care units (ICUs), and improved diagnostic tests were deployed. In many ways, the current coronavirus epidemic is reminiscent of the beginning of the 2009 influenza pandemic. Many health care institutions did substantial work on those plans at that time, and to the extent they still exist, institutions should use those plans as the foundation for needed planning efforts now. Broadly speaking, those plans addressed the protection of health care workers, how to deal with staffing shortages, surges in patient numbers, triage issues, and management of scarce resources. Institutions that were not involved in those plans should seek examples from other institutions and recommendations on how to deal with these complex problems.\nPrepare Hospitals and Clinics to Respond\nHospitals and clinics will have critical roles in the response. This includes establishing protocols for triaging and isolating patients suspected of having infection in emergency departments and urgent care centers so patients with SARS-CoV-2 do not infect others. Similar procedures need to be established in outpatient clinics, dialysis centers, and other medical facilities\u2014especially nursing homes, assisted living centers, and long-term care facilities with particularly vulnerable populations\u2014so that COVID-19 does not disrupt normal medical care and compound the direct morbidity and mortality of the disease.\nA serious challenge in responding to COVID-19 is protecting health care workers and preventing nosocomial infection, which have been major problems in China.2 This will take a combination of hospital administrative approaches, engineering controls, special training of hospital staff, and use of personal protective equipment (PPE). Health care leaders will need to work closely with PPE suppliers and government agencies to maximize manufacture and access to PPE.\nBecause some proportion of patients will be severely ill and require critical care interventions, specific preparation is needed in ICUs. This planning includes evaluation of ICU bed capacity, the ability to augment ICU-level bed space with alternative care sites such as step-down units and postanesthesia care units, mechanical ventilator stock and supply chains, and the logistics of isolating and cohorting patients. Many hospitals operate at or near capacity already, and even an above-average flu season can cause operational disruption.\nIn the 2009 influenza pandemic, advanced modalities such as extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) were used for many patients with severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Criteria to use ECMO for COVID-19\u2014resources permitting\u2014should be developed at centers adept at managing ARDS.3 Additionally, hospital plans regarding crisis standards of care and allocation of scarce resources should be developed if resources are insufficient to treat all those who need them.\nClinicians will need to stay closely attuned to specific clinical guidance that will evolve as more is learned about COVID-19. However, adherence to existing guidance for pneumonia, sepsis, and ARDS will help ensure that the most evidence-based care is provided. This may include the use of investigational antiviral or monoclonal antibody therapy.\nDiagnostic Testing Needs to Be Rapidly Expanded\nUntil recently, all diagnostic testing was performed by the CDC and was based on the presence of both travel history to China plus clinical symptoms. This week, state and public health laboratories as well as other laboratories were granted the authority to develop and use their own SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic tests. This will allow broader testing and has already resulted in various places in the US with the recognition of additional cases without travel links to China.4 Plans to start sentinel surveillance for COVID-19 in 5 major cities was announced.\nTo better understand the burden of COVID-19, medical and public health experts need to expand testing to all patients who have unexplained ARDS or severe pneumonia, and ultimately to patients who have mild symptoms consistent with COVID-19. The CDC and public health laboratories are not designed to process testing on the scale needed for clinics and hospitals to make diagnoses in an epidemic. To reach a high-level testing capacity will require the major clinical diagnostic companies to develop and manufacture testing kits at large scale. Diagnostic companies may simply be able to add SARS-CoV-2 to existing nucleic acid\u2013based respiratory viral panels or create stand-alone tests. Ideally, such diagnostic tests would be rapid, CLIA-waived, and available at the point of care. Serological assays are also needed especially for surveillance purposes and to help determine accurate case-fatality rate.\nClinicians and public health experts will need to be given clear information regarding the operating characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic tests. They need to know the false-positive, false-negative, and predictive values of these tests to make the best clinical and public health decisions. The ability to accurately test individuals for SARS-CoV-2 is critical in all aspects of preparedness.\nPublic Health Actions to Slow the Spread of the Epidemic\nFrom the outset, SARS-CoV-2 posed a near impossible challenge for containment. The outbreak was first recognized in late December and large-scale containment efforts started in mid-January. The virus spread through the respiratory route, caused a spectrum of illness including very mild cases, was efficiently transmitted between humans with an epidemic doubling time of about a week, and was surreptitiously spreading for at least 6 weeks. As more and more countries report cases, including those with no link to the disease epicenter, it is clear that there are many more unrecognized cases in the world and that community transmission is happening in many countries.\nIn China the spread of COVID-19 was fast and intense, particularly in Wuhan. It is not clear yet whether that pattern will occur in other cities around the world. One important goal of public health response efforts now should be diminishing the speed of spread and the peak of the epidemic curve. In seasonal influenza and pandemic influenza, cities have experienced peaks at different times in the epidemic. Working to slow the spread of disease in a city could help diminish the peak burden of disease. The most important public health interventions to slow the spread will be rapid diagnosis and isolation of cases.5 At this early stage of the epidemic, when numbers of cases are low, public health workers should track contacts of cases to the extent resources allow and have them stay home for the virus\u2019 incubation period of 2 weeks. However, beyond a certain threshold, it will no longer be feasible to track all contacts.\nPublic health personnel will also need to consider additional measures to slow the spread of the disease in a community, actions categorized as \u201csocial distancing.\u201d These measures could include cancellation of large gatherings, telecommuting to work when feasible, and school closures. Although there is limited evidence for these measures historically, there is some common sense behind them given that they would reduce social interaction and the chance for the virus to spread in a community. However, political and public health leaders will need to consider the potential benefit of these measures along with their negative societal costs. For example, school closures mean that many children who depend on school meals will not receive them, and many single parents will be out of the workforce.\nPublic health leaders will also need to clearly communicate to the public about the way that they can lower the risk of infection and spread, eg, when and how to wash hands correctly, covering coughs and sneezes, staying home if unwell. It will also be important to communicate to the public and to the health care system that persons who test positive for this virus but who do not need hospital care should stay at home while they are ill and not go to hospitals. Hospitals may have serious challenges in handling the number of people who do need acute care, so it will be important for those who are infected but otherwise well to not contribute to hospital demands.\nThe High Value in Preparations\nWhile it is clear now that SARS-CoV-2 will spread widely in the world, including in the US, the effect of this disease among those who become ill and broader society will be substantially influenced by the preparedness and response work of the health care and public health communities. Preparation will take time, so health care and public health systems need to move quickly forward in their efforts to be ready to confront this disease around the country.\nBack to top\nArticle Information\nCorresponding Author: Thomas V.

Over the following weeks, multiple cases of COVID-19 were identified in the surrounding community and treated at Evergreen Hospital. Most were attributed to US transmission, and the majority were linked to exposures at a skilled nursing facility.\nIn this case series, we describe the clinical presentation, characteristics, and outcomes of incident cases of COVID-19 admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) at Evergreen Hospital to inform other clinicians treating critically ill patients with COVID-19.\nMethods\nPatients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection (positive result by polymerase chain reaction testing of a nasopharyngeal sample) admitted to the ICU at Evergreen Hospital between February 20, 2020, and March 5, 2020, were included. Evergreen Hospital is a 318-bed public hospital with a 20-bed ICU serving approximately 850\u202f000 residents of King and Snohomish counties in Washington State.\nPrior to data collection, a waiver was obtained from the Evergreen Healthcare institutional review board. Deidentified patient data were collected and analyzed using Stata version 15.1 (StataCorp). Laboratory testing was reviewed at ICU admission and on day 5. Chest radiographs were reviewed by an intensivist and a radiologist. Patient outcome data were evaluated after 5 or more days of ICU care or at the time of death. No analysis for statistical significance was performed given the descriptive nature of the study.\nResults\nA total of 21 cases were included (mean age, 70 years [range, 43-92 years]; 52% male). Comorbidities were identified in 18 cases (86%), with chronic kidney disease and congestive heart failure being the most common. Initial symptoms included shortness of breath (76%), fever (52%), and cough (48%) (Table 1). The mean onset of symptoms prior to presenting to the hospital was 3.5 days, and 17 patients (81%) were admitted to the ICU less than 24 hours after hospital admission.\nAn abnormal chest radiograph was observed in 20 patients (95%) at admission. The most common findings on initial radiograph were bilateral reticular nodular opacities (11 patients [52%]) and ground-glass opacities (10 [48%]). By 72 hours, 18 patients (86%) had bilateral reticular nodular opacities and 14 (67%) had evidence of ground-glass opacities. The mean white blood cell count was 9365 \u03bcL at admission and 14 patients (67%) had a white blood cell count in the normal range. Fourteen patients (67%) had an absolute lymphocyte count of less than 1000 cells/\u03bcL. Liver function tests were abnormal in 8 patients (38%) at admission (Table 1).\nMechanical ventilation was initiated in 15 patients (71%) (Table 2). Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) was observed in 15 of 15 patients (100%) requiring mechanical ventilation and 8 of 15 (53%) developed severe ARDS by 72 hours. Although most patients did not present with evidence of shock, vasopressors were used for 14 patients (67%) during the illness. Cardiomyopathy developed in 7 patients (33%). As of March 17, 2020, mortality was 67% and 24% of patients have remained critically ill and 9.5% have been discharged from the ICU.\nDiscussion\nThis study represents the first description of critically ill patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 in the US. These patients had a high rate of ARDS and a high risk of death, similar to published data from China.2 However, this case series adds insight into the presentation and early outcomes in this population and demonstrates poor short-term outcomes among patients requiring mechanical ventilation.\nIt is unclear whether the high rate of cardiomyopathy in this case series reflects a direct cardiac complication of SARS-CoV-2 infection or resulted from overwhelming critical illness. Others have described cardiomyopathy in COVID-19, and further research may better characterize this risk.4,5\nThe limitations of this study include the small number of patients from a single center, that the study population included older residents of skilled nursing facilities, and it is likely not to be broadly applicable to other patients with critical illness. However, this study provides some initial experiences regarding the characteristics of COVID-19 in patients with critical illness in the US and emphasizes the need to limit exposure of nursing home residents to SARS-CoV-2.\nSection Editor: Jody W.

Did his high fevers, worsening shortness of breath, and painful cough indicate coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection? Given his history of asthma and hypertension, was he at high risk? What should they do? Urged to seek medical attention, he resisted. The nearby affordable and accessible urgent care clinics were staffed by physicians who, based on his previous experiences, \u201cjust didn\u2019t get it,\u201d and he anticipated that his concerns would be dismissed. When he relented and requested a coronavirus test, he was asked about international travel, but not about their small apartment or his use of public transportation. He was told \u201cno test,\u201d once again confirming his impressions of an uncaring system. He decided to stay at home and tough it out.\nBut he got worse. The fevers were unrelenting, and it was hard to breathe. He was finally cajoled to try a different clinic. There, the African American receptionist conveyed their concerns and the staff agreed to provide a COVID-19 test. The patient was handed a flyer with home care instructions, but no one asked about financial consequences of staying home and no follow-up plans were provided.\nAnd then good news\u2014the clinic called and reported that the test was negative. Yet, a week later, the high fevers continued. They reached out to the clinic again and were reassured that \u201cthere [was] nothing to be done for coronavirus.\u201d When they asked why the nurse was labeling him a \u201cCOVID patient\u201d when his test was negative for coronavirus, the response was an unapologetic \u201cOops, you got the wrong result.\u201d Now a month later, he is still recovering from COVID-19 and from another painful health care encounter.\nWhy are we\u2014a black senior educator, a white medical foundation president, and a Hispanic public health leader\u2014coming together to share this story? This case is a personal illustration of how the long-standing systemic inequalities in the US health care system result in the tragically unequal effect of COVID-19. Many of the contributing factors\u2014from higher rates of underlying disease risk factors, to long-standing lack of access to health care, to lack of cultural competency, to adverse social determinants of health\u2014predict a higher incidence and worse outcomes for minorities. We are deeply disappointed, but not surprised.\nAs of April 7, disturbing national trends are suggested, despite incomplete data capture. In New York, Hispanic and black people accounted for 34% and 28%, respectively, of deaths from COVID-19, even though they represent only 29% and 22% of the population; while white people accounted for 27% of deaths, even though they represent 32% of the population. In Chicago, black people comprise 32% of the population but thus far have accounted for 52% of nearly 5000 reported cases and approximately 70% of COVID-19 deaths. The infection rate among black people is twice their percentage of the population across Illinois. Across the state of Michigan, black individuals account for 33% of positive COVID-19 tests and 41% of deaths yet represent only 14% of the population. In Louisiana, black people comprise 32% of the population but account for 70% of the COVID-19 deaths. Black individuals comprise 35% of the residents of Charlotte, North Carolina, but more than 40% of COVID-19 cases. In Milwaukee, 26% of the residents are black but account for almost half of the COVID-19 infections and 81% of deaths. North Carolina and South Carolina report a ratio of black to white residents who have tested positive that exceeds predictions from the general population. Data are more limited for Hispanics, but similar troubling statistics are emerging.\nWe propose that the overarching cause of these tragic statistics is decades of the effects of adverse social determinants of health. Even biological risk factors for COVID-19 like diabetes, obesity, asthma, and hypertension can reflect environmental and sociological precipitating and contributing factors, as much as racial differences in biology. A noninclusive list of confounders from the ecosystem of social determinants of health relevant to COVID-19 include struggling in poverty with limited job and social mobility; working frontline jobs with lack of adequate personal protective equipment (eg, public transportation, pharmacy, grocery, and warehouse distribution workers); living in crowded apartments where social distancing is impossible; shopping in food deserts or swamps without access to healthful foods; being underinsured and using self-rationing of health care as a strategy; relying on public transportation on crowded buses and subways; and having a public kindergarten through 12th-grade education that too often leads to functional health illiteracy.\nOther contributors may have reinforcing effects, including health beliefs and behavioral choices that manifest differently across cultures. Workforce diversity within health care makes a difference, especially in decision-making by minority patients. The persistent racial, ethnic, and cultural incongruity between physicians and patients, especially for African American men, reached a nadir last year after 35 years of decline. Subconscious racial bias in health care exists, as documented by differences in cardiovascular procedures and solid organ transplants. Patient choice and responsibility could be factors as well. Late self-referral because of distrust, health beliefs, and even disease fatalism may be present in some minority communities. Dangerous behavioral choices, such as attending events with large crowds or partying on spring-break beaches, increase the risk to the individual and to others. People must make good choices, but they must have good choices to make. An adequate pandemic response requires understanding of the cultural differences that drive these choices.\nThe data, while still limited, are compelling and make a strong case for including health disparities and the effect of the social determinants of health on COVID-19 in pandemic response planning. Only with such data can pandemic response planners and policy makers design interventions targeted to and accepted by different subgroups of our population. An emerging infection like coronavirus falls under \u201call threats and hazards\u201d preparedness in the National Response Framework (NRF), which is a guide to how the US responds to all types of disasters and emergencies. Based on principles of scalability, flexibility, and adaptability identified within the National Incident Management System, sections of the NRF address vulnerable populations like older adults and those with chronic diseases and selected racial and ethnic populations like American Indians and people on tribal lands.\nBut this key document does not address the vulnerability of other minority populations and thus does not provide a data-driven context for designing and implementing programs for those who likely require more outcome monitoring and differential assistance in national health crises. Identifying these populations in advance or in this case as the pandemic evolves can raise sentinel observations on the local levels, increase the timeliness and community acceptance of interventions, and encourage science-based refutation of incorrect claims of biological differences. The current pandemic brings to the surface the need for consideration of the specific risks for African Americans and Hispanics under an \u201call threats and hazards\u201d approach, based on data and social determinants of health. Moreover, we are further concerned that the COVID-19 pandemic may identify other demographic groups for consideration like poor whites in rural areas and the Deep South. The best stress test, in this case data, is often the one that identifies risk as it is occurring and prompts a preemptive response at the federal, state, and local level.\nWe favor 2 immediate interventions for the COVID-19 pandemic. First, mandate that the collection and reporting of COVID-19 cases and outcomes be stratified by race/ethnicity, sex, socioeconomic status, and community health status in all states. This will allow targeting of resources and development of culturally relevant interventions that are accepted by the highest-risk groups. To do so, more testing must be done, and the results used to design responses. For instance, as of April 9, only 14 states (\u2009\u2248\u200910% of the US population) have publicly shared COVID outcomes by race/ethnicity with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).\nSecond, begin multilingual targeted public service announcements (PSAs) for minority communities that emphasize the unequal risk and the importance of empowered solutions like social distancing and how to access testing and health care services. A powerful example of a PSA is the video by actor Idris Elba,1 who told of his COVID-19 infection and urged all people \u201cto take this seriously.\u201d Messages of early self-referral, reassurances of compassionate and culturally sensitive care that is not dependent on insurance and wealth, and a pithy reminder to \u201cBe Kool, Stay Home\u201d could be delivered by well-recognized and influential people, including the minority bedrock faith community.\nCOVID-19 is not the \u201cgreat equalizer\u201d but the great tester of differences. To some, the disproportionate effects of COVID-19 may represent a Hurricane Katrina redux.\nThe next stress test of the health system could have a different outcome if we learn from the tragic racial and ethnic disparities of the current pandemic and make changes in the US clinical care delivery and public health policy. Ensuring access to culturally competent health care and creating policies and programs that address the social determinants of health are key to moving toward health equity. Public health policies must be tailored to the needs of all communities and reflect that health equity can only be achieved if interventions are made with an understanding of the differing and unequal life realities of minority populations. Addressing the contribution of historical and social racism must be pillars for the future and in place before the next pandemic occurs.\nSection Editor: Preeti Malani, MD, MSJ, Associate Editor.\nBack to top\nArticle Information\nCorresponding Author: William F.

The number of cases and deaths cannot be explained simply because of the epidemic starting in Italy earlier compared with other countries besides China. It is important to understand why death rates were so high in Italy to learn how to best prepare and how to plan for optimal actions in other countries. Some contributing factors may be immutable (eg, age structure of the population), but even these need to be laid out carefully in preparedness assessments. Some other contributing factors are potentially modifiable.\nSome factors pertain to demographics and background disease in the population. Italy has the most elderly population in Europe and the second most elderly population in the world after Japan. COVID-19 has a strong age dependence for the severity of the infection and the risk of death. The median age of people infected with SARS-CoV-2 who are dying in Italy has been 80 years, and the average age of patients requiring critical care support has been 67 years. Moreover, COVID-19 morbidity and mortality is strongly dependent on the presence of concomitant serious diseases, and Italy has a high proportion of patients with history of smoking and high rates of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and ischemic heart disease.2 The corollary is that preparedness for needs of intensive care unit (ICU) beds and estimates of expected deaths should consider the age structure and chronic diseases of the population served by each health care system. Taking this adjustment into account, burden of disease may be expected to be much less in most areas in the United States, with variability across states and hospital catchment areas. For example, the proportion of the population older than 65 years is 9.5% in Alaska as compared with 19.1% in Florida and 23.1% in Italy.\nA second set of factors in Italy is the increased burden of cases that presented themselves to the health care system. The proportion of people infected must have been very high in specific areas that were highly affected. In the town of V\u00f2, all 3300 residents were tested the day the first case was detected in the third week of February, and 3% were found to be infected.3 Following aggressive testing, the epidemic was extinguished. However, elsewhere in Italy, it is likely that the prevalence of infection was several times higher in the absence of effective public health intervention. For example, it is likely that the health care system was overwhelmed in Bergamo owing to massive viral transmission during the Champions League match on February 19, 2020 (Atalanta vs Valencia), where a third of the population of Bergamo attended and continued celebrations overnight. Italian life is famous for its socialization and frequent congregations and clustering. It is possible also that in early stages, there was not much adoption of standard hygienic measures, and instructions to stay at home proved difficult to accept, with many complaints registered with the police.4 Accordingly, a higher level of preparedness should be considered for areas where mass gatherings have occurred or where there is extensive social intermingling.\nA third set of factors pertains to the standard capacity of the health care system and decisions made during hospital management of the presenting cases. Italy has a highly competent state-run health care system, but it has only a modest number of ICU beds and very few subintensive care beds. Overall, 5090 ICU beds (8.4 per 100\u202f000 population) are available in Italy, and 2601 beds in coronary care units (4.3 per 100\u202f000 population),5 as opposed to much higher numbers (36 ICU beds per 100\u202f000 population) in the United States.\nGiven the little experience in dealing with the new virus, it is unavoidable that some strategic mistakes were made about which patients should be hospitalized. In the winter, hospitals tend to run close to full capacity, with 87% average occupancy in Italy during the flu season. Apparently, many patients with relatively modest symptoms were admitted; by the time more patients with severe cases started to arrive, there were limited reserves.\nHospital overcrowding may also explain the high infection rate of medical personnel. As of March 30, 2020, 8920 medical personnel had been found to be infected in Italy,6 leading to further loss of capacity for hospitals to respond. Moreover, early infection of medical personnel led to the spread of the infection to other patients within hospitals. In Lombardy, SARS-CoV-2 became largely a nosocomial infection. Nine percent of infections in Italy occurred among health care personnel.6 Characteristically, the first patient with COVID-19 visited the emergency department twice, thus exposing all of the personnel and patients in that area before the infection was recognized.\nItaly is a decentralized country; thus, preparedness and containment may have been hampered. There was a delay from the first case detection (February 21, 2020) to the first containment decree from the government that closed the relevant villages 3 days later. The lessons relevant to other countries are the need to (1) avoid bringing patients with suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection to the hospital, except when they clearly require hospital care; (2) maintain strict hygienic procedures in the hospital environment; and (3) act swiftly in case of exposures of medical personnel to avoid loss of personnel capacity.\nStochastic factors should also be considered. Not all of Italy, but a few cities among hundreds of cities and towns have carried most of the burden of the epidemic and have seen their hospitals crash. The Lombardy, Emilia-Romagna, and Veneto regions carry the highest numbers of infected individuals and account for 46%, 13%, and 9% of all Italian cases, respectively. The most affected provinces are Bergamo, Brescia, Milan, and Cremona, which together account for 33% of all Italian cases.6 There is heavy seasonality of deaths (even more so in countries with high proportions of the elderly and people who smoke, like Italy), with 25% more deaths in winter as compared with summer.7 Many of the excessive deaths are related to respiratory infections and are an annual occurrence. Although the infections are typically related to influenza, in 2020, SARS-CoV-2 is also a key contributor. In fact, in the 3 months prior to the outbreak, there were fewer deaths than is typical for the winter months in North Italian cities, thus leaving a larger pool of susceptible, elderly individuals.8 The seasonal peak of deaths varies across hospitals, and it may be difficult to predict which hospital will have the maximal burden. The corollary is that some reserves of resources, such as ventilators, should be in a stand-by allocation with the ability to assign them rapidly to hospitals that saturate their capacity.\nIn the absence of prevalence and incidence data, including the results of serology testing, it is difficult to predict the effects of specific major public health decisions, such as lockdowns, on the course of the COVID-19 pandemic. For example, it is not known whether implementing a lockdown at a time when many people can infect others could lead people to spend more time in close quarters with the elderly and those who are susceptible. Similarly, it is not known whether a new epidemic wave may emerge when lockdown measures are removed. There are also unanswered questions about whether the stress and panic of a public crisis leading to major disruption and lockdown may have increased the susceptibility of elderly and frail individuals to a respiratory virus. Countries with aggressive early contact tracing and extensive laboratory testing (eg, Taiwan9 and South Korea) seem to offer examples of successful containment. By comparison, in Italy both contact tracing and laboratory testing were more limited, and lockdown had to be used as a last, blind measure of desperation. It is important to study the effects of the policies that are adopted first on the expected wave of patients with severe illness who will need hospitalization.\nFinally, a major question that should be answered is the causal contribution of SARS-CoV-2 infection to related deaths. It is difficult to differentiate between deaths with SARS-CoV-2 infection and deaths caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection because the vast majority of patients who have died had 1 or more other major pathologies (98.8% with at least 1 comorbidity, and 48.6% having 3 or more diseases) that contributed to their death.10 Also, the lost quality-adjusted life-years of patients who died and any long-term consequences for patients who survive should be formally studied.

Previous strains of coronavirus have been demonstrated to invade the central nervous system through the olfactory neuroepithelium and propagate from within the olfactory bulb.2 Furthermore, nasal epithelial cells display the highest expression of the SARS-CoV-2 receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, in the respiratory tree.3\nDespite anecdotal reports of anosmia, only 1 study to our knowledge has evaluated the prevalence of smell and taste disturbance in hospitalized patients with COVID-19, reporting an overall prevalence of 34% but without data on timing of onset in relation to other symptoms.4\nThis study evaluated prevalence, intensity, and timing of an altered sense of smell or taste in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infections.\nMethods\nThe study was approved by the ethics committee of Treviso and Belluno provinces, and informed consent was obtained verbally for telephone interviews. Adults (\u226518 years) consecutively assessed at Treviso Regional Hospital between March 19 and March 22, 2020, were included if they tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA by polymerase chain reaction on nasopharyngeal and throat swabs that were performed according to the World Health Organization recommendation5 and if they were suitable for home management as mildly symptomatic.\nPatients were contacted 5 to 6 days after the swab was performed, the demographic information was reported, and the Acute Respiratory Tract Infection Questionnaire (ARTIQ; with symptoms scored as none, 0; a little, 1; a lot, 2) was administered. During the telephone interview, they were asked whether they had experienced a sudden onset of an altered sense of smell or taste in the 2 weeks before the swab through completion of the Sino-nasal Outcome Test 22 (SNOT-22). The SNOT-22 grades symptom severity as none (0), very mild (1), mild or slight (2), moderate (3), severe (4), or as bad as it can be (5).6 Symptom prevalence was expressed as the percentage of total patients; 95% confidence intervals were calculated using Clopper-Pearson method. Prevalence was compared using the Fisher exact test. P values <.05 (2 sided) were considered statistically significant. Statistical analyses were performed using R version 3.6.\nResults\nOf 374 eligible patients, contact information was available for 283; 202 (71.4%) completed the telephone survey.\nDemographic data and clinical features are summarized in Table 1. The median age was 56 years (range, 20-89 years); 52.0% were women. Any altered sense of smell or taste was reported by 130 patients (64.4%, 95% CI, 57.3%-71.0%), with a median SNOT-22 score of 4 (interquartile range, 3-5); 23.8% reported a score of 5 (Table 2). Of 130 patients reporting an altered sense of smell or taste, 45 (34.6%) also reported blocked nose. Other frequent symptoms were fatigue (68.3%), dry or productive cough (60.4%), and fever (55.5%). Among all patients, the timing of an altered sense of smell or taste onset in relation to other symptoms occurred before other symptoms in 24 (11.9%); at same time as in 46 (22.8%); and after other symptoms in 54 (26.7%; Table 2). An altered sense of smell or taste was reported as the only symptom by 6 patients (3.0%). An altered sense of smell or taste was more frequent among 105 women (72.4%, 95% CI: 62.8%-80.7%) than among 97 men (55.7%, 95% CI: 45.2%-65.8%; P\u2009=\u2009.02).\nDiscussion\nAlterations in smell or taste were frequently reported by mildly symptomatic patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection and often were the first apparent symptom. The results must be interpreted with caution due to study limitations: data were self-reported and based on a cross-sectional survey, the sample was relatively small and geographically limited, more severe patients were not included, and data regarding the subsequent course of the disease was not available. Although the SNOT-22 questionnaire has been shown to correlate with objective testing of olfactory function, patients may have difficulty in quantifying olfactory function; objective tests should be included in future studies.\nIf these results are confirmed, consideration should be given to testing and self-isolation of patients with new onset of altered taste or smell during the COVID-19 pandemic.\nSection Editor: Jody W.

In addition, 171 patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection were evacuated on February 5 to a US Air Force base in California following exposure on a cruise ship. These patients, who were asymptomatic or only mildly symptomatic, were transferred to local hospitals using a containment strategy.3 When a small number of infected patients are in concentrated locales, containment strategies (ie, quarantine) can halt the spread of infection by isolating infected or exposed individuals from the general population.4 However, disease containment requires the use of airborne isolation rooms, personal protective and other disposable equipment, and significant numbers of health care personnel. As COVID-19 spreads both in the US and around the world, it may not be possible to care for all patients in this manner.\nThe advent of multiple new COVID-19\u2013positive cases in the US who lack identifiable travel history or exposure signals that community transmission of SARS-CoV-2 has started and is occurring outside the containment zones of hospitals.1 Because these patients were not preemptively identified as persons under investigation, multiple community members and health care workers were exposed to SARS-CoV-2. As a result, hospital personnel have been furloughed under quarantine while they are evaluated for symptom onset and evidence of infection. These events not only affect the hospitals providing patient care to suspected and confirmed COVID-19 cases but also limit the personnel for adjacent emergency departments (EDs), intensive care units, and inpatient wards. It is critically important that the strategy for slowing the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic change from containment to mitigation. Mitigation approaches seek to: (1) slow the further spread of the virus, (2) reduce the anticipated surge in health care use, (3) provide patients with the right level of care to maximize the likelihood that the majority of patients will only require time-limited home isolation, (4) expand testing capability to increase available hospital capacity, and (5) tailor isolation to minimize transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Without rapid uptake of these approaches across hospitals, COVID-19 will pose a critical risk to an already strained health care system.\nEmerging data indicate that SARS-CoV-2 is primarily spread by droplets, is likely to be more easily transmitted than seasonal influenza based on an R0 of 2.0 to 2.5, and can spread through asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic individuals who would not normally seek medical care or evaluation.1,5 Eighty percent of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 have minimal or mild symptoms.2 Combining these characteristics and the emergence of community transmission, it is likely that silent spread has already occurred in multiple US locales. As a result, COVID-19 containment is no longer realistic and further emphasis on containment strategies may have the unintended consequence of hampering effective health care delivery for patients infected with COVID-19 and others who require general hospital care. At Kaiser Permanente, emergency management and preparedness teams are focused on developing a COVID-19 mitigation program (Table) based on good clinical practice, available evidence, and past experience. Whether this program will effectively achieve mitigation remains unknown.\nTable.  Key Elements of a Proposed Plan for Coronavirus Disease 2019 Community Spread Mitigation in Kaiser Permanente Northern California\nView LargeDownload\nWithin acute care settings, the focus will be on minimizing disease transmission. Because SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted primarily by droplets, the proposed plan will focus on ensuring that reliable droplet precautions are used. Personal protective equipment will include the use of a surgical mask, disposable gowns, gloves, and protective eyewear. This approach is intended to simplify the workflow and preserve the use of enhanced airborne transmission precaution equipment like N95 masks and controlled or powered air-purifying respirators for patients with diseases like tuberculosis. Full airborne isolation precautions will continue to be in place for high-risk procedures including endotracheal intubation and bronchoscopy. All single rooms in the hospital would be available to accommodate droplet isolation, preserving the limited number of negative-pressure rooms for patients requiring true airborne isolation. Patient transport, including via emergency medical services, should similarly use droplet precautions. COVID-19 mitigation also requires that patients who are asymptomatic or who only have mild symptoms of viral respiratory infection will be asked to stay in isolation at home until they are well (ie, resolution of fever, improvements in cough). Household family members will be advised to avoid close contact while the patient is symptomatic. Patients isolated in the home may still receive specific SARS-CoV-2 testing based on clinical or epidemiological considerations. Similar to the approach used for an influenzalike illness, patients would be advised not to attend work or school until symptoms are resolved.\nIf patients\u2019 symptoms progress, the proposed plan suggests that remote care could be delivered through telephone or video conferencing and treatment protocols to ensure social distancing when appropriate. For patients with progressive or more severe symptoms, designating specific sites for outpatient evaluation, such as clearly identified ambulatory clinic sites, free-standing structures (eg, tents), or mobile testing units could minimize exposure to health care workers and other individuals. Patients would be able to initiate self-transport or emergency medical service\u2013based transport to EDs as needed. SARS-CoV-2 testing must be made available for inpatients and outpatients, similar to current rapid testing protocols for influenza, to establish the extent of community spread and ensure the optimal use of single room isolation for EDs and hospital units. According to the proposed plan, hospitalized patients with infectious symptoms would be cared for within single rooms following existing protocols for droplet precautions. In the case of a surge in the number of affected inpatients, placing multiple patients within a single room could occur if all are known to be positive for SARS-CoV-2. Through ongoing monitoring of hospital capacity, dynamic assessments will determine if additional sites such as mobile hospital units will be necessary. Restrictions to patient visitation would be similar to those that were in place for the H1N1 influenza pandemic, in which symptomatic and nonfamily members were asked to avoid hospital visitation. Patients who experience a resolution of their symptoms at home could return to work or school as is the practice for seasonal influenza. Hospital-based isolation would continue until discharge or based on testing recommendations issued by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).\nEven though health care worker furlough policies are effective during a containment phase, they are ineffective in the presence of ongoing community spread during which staff may be as likely to be exposed to infection outside the health care setting as within it. The proposed plan will follow similar protocols to those in place for influenza exposure. Personnel with workplace exposures to patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 should self-monitor for fever, cough, and other symptoms. If they become ill and are confirmed not to have COVID-19, personnel would remain off work until the resolution of fever and until their other symptoms begin to improve. Health care personnel with confirmed COVID-19 should be off work as per CDC guidelines.\nHealth product vendors are notifying hospitals that medical supplies may become limited for both COVID-19\u2013specific and other general supplies. Personal protective equipment may become severely limited, underscoring the importance of following isolation protocols consistent with the mechanism of spread of the virus to maintain availability. Communication and coordination between the private hospital system and federal, state, and local authorities will be of the utmost importance. COVID-19 is undergoing community transmission in California and elsewhere in the US and has critical implications for the health care system. Shifting from a containment strategy to a mitigation approach, as suggested in the proposed plan, could allow optimization of health care delivery under the expectation of personnel and supply shortfalls in an already strained health care system. Clear guidelines shared across hospitals and states could help improve the ability to maintain a capable and sustainable approach for all patients. Pandemics bring much uncertainty. But what is certain is that the ingenuity of the public health authorities in partnership with hospital systems will be critically important to shift the strategy to meet the requirements of this evolving epidemic.\nBack to top\nArticle Information\nCorresponding Author: Stephen M.

The WHO interim guidelines made general recommendations for treatment of ARDS in this setting, including that consideration be given to referring patients with refractory hypoxemia to expert centers capable of providing extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO).2\nECMO is a form of modified cardiopulmonary bypass in which venous blood is removed from the body and pumped through an artificial membrane lung in patients who have refractory respiratory or cardiac failure.5 Oxygen is added, carbon dioxide is removed, and blood is returned to the patient, either via another vein to provide respiratory support or a major artery to provide circulatory support. ECMO is a resource-intensive, highly specialized, and expensive form of life support with the potential for significant complications, in particular hemorrhage and nosocomial infection. Recent evidence suggests that use of ECMO in the most severe cases of ARDS is associated with reduced mortality.6 There is some evidence that outcomes from ECMO are better in higher-volume centers.7\nThe role of ECMO in the management of COVID-19 is unclear at this point. It has been used in some patients with COVID-19 in China but detailed information is unavailable.3 ECMO may have a role in the management of some patients with COVID-19 who have refractory hypoxemic respiratory failure.6 However, much about the virus is unknown, including the natural history, incidence of late complications, viral persistence, or the prognoses in different subsets of patients. This uncertainty might be compared to the emergence of influenza A(H1N1) in 2009, when it was initially unclear what the role of ECMO should be.8 However, the degree of uncertainty surrounding COVID-19 is much greater. To address this, prompt mobilization of existing registries and clinical research groups should help facilitate the systematic collection of data. For example, the Extracorporeal Life Support Organization (ELSO) Registry is being adapted to acquire new information about COVID-19 and prospective observational studies are under way.\nECMO does not provide direct support for organs other than the lungs or heart beyond increasing systemic oxygen delivery and mitigating ventilator-induced lung injury. A substantial proportion of critically ill patients with COVID-19 appear to have developed cardiac arrhythmias or shock,3 but it is unknown how many have or will develop refractory multiorgan failure, for which ECMO may be of more limited use. To postulate about the potential benefit of ECMO in this infection, more data on the mechanism of death and disease are required. The virus may cause death through progressive hypoxic respiratory failure, septic shock, refractory multiorgan failure, or by precipitating exacerbation of comorbid diseases such as ischemic heart disease or cardiac failure, but the relative proportions of these diseases in large cohorts of patients with COVID-19 infection are unknown.\nThe global spread of COVID-19, although the number of cases outside of China remains small, will likely occur via many dispersed epicenters where local transmission has become established. If these epicenters occur in sophisticated health care systems with preexisting ECMO programs, this will provide vital information about the utility of ECMO and help anticipate global demand. Should the initial experience be encouraging, it is likely that non-ECMO centers will refer early to ECMO centers in anticipation of impending clinical deterioration. This will disproportionately affect hospitals with ECMO programs, even when ECMO is not required.\nFurthermore, with the apparent contagiousness of this virus and the relatively high numbers of patients who require intensive care, this may prove very resource-consumptive. Countries will need to pay specific attention to the considerable investment needed to provide ECMO during this outbreak. Judgment will be needed to decide when ECMO may be worthwhile and when it may not, understanding that the risk-to-benefit ratio of performing ECMO in these circumstances is dynamic and dependent on many factors. If the mechanism of death in COVID-19 ultimately includes a substantial number of patients with septic shock or refractory multiorgan failure, then the shift away from ECMO is likely to occur earlier because the most severely ill patients in this cohort would be less likely to benefit. The higher the all-cause mortality, the less relevant ECMO becomes.\nRegardless, ECMO is clearly a finite resource. In a large outbreak, additional limitations to providing ECMO may include a lack of ECMO consoles or disposable equipment, suitably trained staff, or isolation rooms with the requisite infrastructure. Many materials necessary to make ECMO circuitry are manufactured in China and it is conceivable that the outbreak may disrupt supply chains.\nA number of different models of ECMO service provision exist worldwide, ranging from a relative lack of regulation and centralization\u2014with many hospitals having ECMO capability but often with very low case volumes (eg, in the US or Japan)\u2014through to regional or national coordination of ECMO referral centers with dedicated interhospital retrieval teams (eg, New Zealand, Australia, Singapore, Qatar, the United Kingdom, or Sweden). In response to influenza A(H1N1) in 2009, some countries such as Italy adopted the latter model and it is possible that COVID-19 could be addressed similarly. The advantages of such an approach include standardization of indications, management, data collection, and containment.5,7 The disadvantage is the potential for hospitals that provide ECMO to be overwhelmed with critically ill patients unless interhospital transfers are centrally coordinated.\nWith the WHO recommendation for ECMO in place and the tropism of the COVID-19 virus for severe respiratory illness, the number of cases in which ECMO is used may increase over the course of this outbreak. However, there may come a tipping point. Should the case volume in any given region increase beyond the ability to provide routine care, any earlier increase in ECMO use may give way, with utilization later decreasing in proportion to the overwhelming demands on the system as a whole.\nSupport with ECMO is for the most critically ill patients in regions with the extensive resources required to provide this therapy. ECMO is not a therapy to be rushed to the frontline when all resources are stretched in a pandemic. In less well-resourced countries, many more lives will be saved by ensuring oxygen and pulse oximetry are widely available. Mitigation efforts to slow the outbreak are critical so that health care systems are not overwhelmed and all patients receive the correct management, whether simply confirmation of the diagnosis and appropriate quarantine, oxygen therapy alone, mechanical ventilation or, for those most likely to benefit, ECMO.\nBack to top\nArticle Information\nCorresponding Author: Graeme MacLaren, MSc, Cardiothoracic Intensive Care Unit, National University Health System, 5 Lower Kent Ridge Rd, Singapore 119074 (gmaclaren@iinet.net.au).\nPublished Online: February 19, 2020. doi:10.1001/jama.2020.2342\nConflict of Interest Disclosures: Dr Brodie reported receiving grants from Alung Technologies, serving on the medical advisory board for Alung Technologies, Xenios, Breethe, Baxter, and Hemovent.

Four patients without coexisting diseases received convalescent plasma around hospital day 20, and a patient with hypertension and mitral valve insufficiency received the plasma transfusion at day 10. The donor plasma had demonstrable IgG and IgM anti\u2013SARS-CoV-19 antibodies and neutralized the virus in in vitro cultures. Although these patients continued to receive antiviral treatment primarily with lopinavir/ritonavir and interferon, the use of convalescent plasma may have contributed to their recovery because the clinical status of all patients had improvement approximately 1 week after transfusion, as evidenced by normalization of body temperature as well as improvements in Sequential Organ Failure Assessment scores and Pao2/Fio2 ratio. In addition, the patients\u2019 neutralizing antibody titers increased and respiratory samples tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 between 1 and 12 days after transfusion.\nEven though the cases in the report by Shen et al are compelling and well-studied, this investigation has important limitations that are characteristic of other \u201canecdotal\u201d case series. The intervention, administration of convalescent plasma, was not evaluated in a randomized clinical trial, and the outcomes in the treatment group were not compared with outcomes in a control group of patients who did not receive the intervention. Therefore, it is not possible to determine the true clinical effect of this intervention or whether patients might have recovered without this therapy. In addition, patients received numerous other therapies (including antiviral agents and steroids), making it impossible to disentangle the specific contribution of convalescent plasma to the clinical course or outcomes. Moreover, convalescent plasma was administered up to 3 weeks after hospital admission, and it is unclear whether this timing is optimal or if earlier administration might have been associated with different clinical outcomes. Despite these limitations, the study does provide some evidence to support the possibility of evaluating this well-known therapy in more rigorous investigations involving patients with COVID-19 and severe illness.\nThe use of convalescent plasma is not new; it was used for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), pandemic 2009 influenza A (H1N1), avian influenza A (H5N1), several hemorrhagic fevers such as Ebola, and other viral infections. For instance, in 2005, Cheng et al reported outcomes of patients who received convalescent plasma in Hong Kong during the 2003 SARS outbreak.2 Although this investigation was not a randomized trial, of 1775 patients, the 80 who received convalescent plasma had a lower mortality rate (12.5%) compared with the overall SARS-related mortality for admitted patients (n\u2009=\u2009299 [17%]). The antibody titers and plasma transfusion volumes varied and did not appear to correlate with clinical response; however, patients receiving transfusion within 14 days of symptom onset (n\u2009=\u200933) had better outcomes. No adverse events were reported among patients receiving convalescent plasma.\nDespite the potential utility of passive antibody treatments, there have been few concerted efforts to use them as initial therapies against emerging and pandemic infectious threats. The absence of large trials certainly contributes to the hesitancy to employ this treatment. Also, the most effective formulations (convalescent plasma or hyperimmune globulin, H-Ig) are unknown. Convalescent plasma has the advantage that while its antibodies limit viral replication, other plasma components can also exert beneficial effects such as replenishing coagulation factors when given to patients with hemorrhagic fevers such as Ebola.3-5 On the other hand, individual convalescent plasma units demonstrate donor-dependent variability in antibody specificities and titers. H-Ig preparations, in contrast, contain standardized antibody doses, although fractionation removes IgM, which may be necessary against some viruses. Nonetheless, the construction of a strategic stockpile of frozen, pathogen-reduced plasma, collected from Ebola-convalescent patients with well-characterized viral neutralization activities, is one example of how to proceed despite existing unknowns.6\nDeploying passive antibody therapies against the rapidly increasing number of COVID-19 cases provides an unprecedented opportunity to perform clinical studies of the efficacy of this treatment against a viral agent. If the results of rigorously conducted investigations, such as a large-scale randomized clinical trial, demonstrate efficacy, use of this therapy also could help change the course of this pandemic.4 Shen et al used apheresis products produced in the hospital.1\nHow could this be scaled to meet increased demands? One approach would be to combine the use of convalescent plasma and H-Ig in a complementary way to treat infected patients in the current COVID-19 pandemic, and subsequent infectious waves, perhaps with the following steps and considerations. First, blood centers could start collecting plasma from convalescent donors, preferably at the leading edge of the infectious wave; health care workers could encourage COVID-19\u2013infected patients to donate after hospital discharge. Plasma would be tested, frozen, and distributed to hospitals; paired samples would be retained for concurrent investigations.\nSecond, within days of collection, clinicians could transfuse convalescent plasma to infected patients. This approach would be expected to be most effective in patients before they develop a humoral response to COVID-19; serology tests that detect COVID-19 neutralizing antibodies would be beneficial in identifying the best treatment candidates. Monitoring patient responses by clinical, laboratory, and imaging results could be compared against antibody titers, specificities, and neutralizing activities in paired plasma samples to develop better algorithms for identifying patient and donor factors that predict clinical efficacy.\nThird, funding to expand plasma collection capabilities, as well as for academic, industry, and government research initiatives, could mobilize these efforts. However, despite potentially rapid availability, the deployment of convalescent plasma will have limited reach because transfusions are typically performed in hospital settings and may require large infusion volumes. In addition, plasma transfusions are also associated with adverse events ranging from mild fever and allergic reactions to life-threatening bronchospasm, transfusion-related acute lung injury, and circulatory overload in patients with cardiorespiratory disorders, which must be carefully tracked.3 There is also a small, but nonzero, risk of infectious disease transmission.\nFourth, dynamic modeling of COVID-19 infections and factors that are associated with clinical efficacy could be used to inform the distribution of convalescent plasma (and donors) between blood centers and the source plasma industry so the latter can manufacture concentrated COVID-19 H-Ig. Fifth, within several months, it could be possible for clinicians to begin using small volume H-Ig preparations in ambulatory settings and drive-through clinics, as well as in hospitals. Concentrated H-Ig preparations are an injectable, time-tested treatment for viral (eg, hepatitis A and B) and bacterial (eg, tetanus, diphtheria) diseases. In principle, each dose delivers antibody preparations with accurately determined specificities, affinities, and titers against COVID-19 and is logistically simpler than plasma to distribute worldwide. As with convalescent plasma, it will be critical to identify factors that predict responses to COVID-19 H-Ig, and also to track adverse events.\nWhile H-Ig (like plasma) can be stored for years,7 a similar pathway may need to be reactivated next season, especially as passive antibody efficacy wanes due to accumulated viral mutations. During each iteration, the investigations performed in parallel to clinical use will drive improvements, for example by guiding the relative amounts of convalescent plasma vs H-Ig that are prepared, or by identifying patients most likely to benefit from these treatments.\nBoth academic4 and industry groups are beginning to investigate the efficacy of passive antibody therapies for COVID-19 infection. If substantial, robust evidence from rigorously conducted clinical trials clearly establishes effectiveness, and if tests could identify patients who could benefit from passive immunity, the US and other countries could consider a national campaign to provide such treatment. Although a logistical challenge, this may be one approach to protect high-risk populations and could synergize with parallel efforts to develop vaccines and antiviral drugs. However, just as executive direction was critical for rapid implementation of COVID-19 tests, so it will be important to accelerate this effort. Specifically, guidance would be needed to direct blood centers and plasma fractionators to begin prioritizing collections from COVID-19-convalescent donors; expedite the availability of these products for therapeutic use; create a data collection, analysis, and regulatory infrastructure to identify factors that predict therapeutic efficacy and to inform the relative levels of convalescent plasma vs H-Ig production; and remove regulatory barriers that, for example, currently limit the use of pathogen reduction technology for convalescent plasma collections or that require several-month inventory holds on H-Ig pharmaceuticals.\nBack to top\nArticle Information\nCorresponding Author: Jeannette Guarner, MD, Emory Medical Laboratories, Emory University Hospital-Midtown Core Laboratory, Emory University School of Medicine, 1364 Clifton Rd, Atlanta, GA 30322 (jguarne@emory.edu).\nPublished Online: March 27, 2020. doi:10.1001/jama.2020.4940\nConflict of Interest Disclosures: Dr Roback reports being a member of the American Red Cross Biomedical Services Medical Advisory Council; a consultant to CSL Plasma; a consultant to Secure Transfusion Services; and a cofounder, stockholder, and consultant to Cambium Medical Technologies.

The unparalleled need for intensive care during this period challenges clinicians to bring their best efforts to the bedside, while advising health care leaders on the optimal management of resources to deliver that care in each jurisdiction. A renewed sense of community is avowed among critical care clinicians who share their early observations through traditional and social media, such that learnings from one group of patients can inform the care of the next.\nThe multicenter report by Grasselli and colleagues in JAMA provides sobering evidence about the burden of critical illness associated with COVID-19 in Lombardy, Italy.1 Of the 1591 predominantly older, male patients with comorbid conditions admitted to the intensive care units (ICUs) of 72 hospitals from February 20 to March 18, 2020, the majority had moderate to severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Overall, of the 88% of patients who underwent endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation, the median level of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) was 14 cm H2O. In this cohort, 11% received noninvasive ventilation, exposure to which may have been even more extensive outside the ICU, in original or repurposed high-dependency units for patients with COVID-19, and 27% received early prone ventilation, reflecting the growing reports of using this strategy. By the end of the follow-up period, 26% of patients had died while 58% remained in the ICU. As reported in other series, older patients appeared to have the worst outcomes.1\nThe demographic characteristics of the Italian population in this study differ in some respects from earlier experiences in China. Both countries reported male sex, older age, and hypertension as risk factors for severe COVID-19 disease. However, more patients in this series received invasive ventilation, which may reflect inherent differences in clinical presentation, ICU admission criteria, or approaches to management. The massive and acute strain on normally limited ICU resources is striking. Over a period of 28 days, close to 1600 patients, most of whom required ventilatory support, were admitted to 72 Italian ICUs, an average of 22 patients per ICU. Moreover, the median ICU length of stay was 9 days. This demand far exceeds the capacity of even the best-resourced health care system and points to the potential morbidity and mortality awaiting in less-resourced areas.\nTransparency in reporting the experience of patients and physicians in some parts of the world helps to telegraph what could lie ahead in other parts. Thus, pandemic-focused studies that document the presentation, clinical characteristics, and prognosis of patients with COVID-19, such as this one from northern Italy,1 helps inform patient care elsewhere. Efforts by this consortium to gather data by telephone augmented the real-time data collection and retrospective review of hospital records that formed the basis of this report. Observations from Lombardy also inform investigators planning much-needed interventional trials by considering rates of life support utilization, fatality, and the frequency and severity of morbidity outcomes for patients with COVID-19\u2013related critical illness. Context matters in this regard, because illness trajectories are dependent on each setting and circumstance.\nWorldwide, an imperative to quickly design and conduct pandemic-focused treatment studies is understood. That clinical research is a societal good is particularly germane in these times. However, there are many barriers to research implementation in the ICU during a pandemic.2,3 These include treatment under uncertainty and surge conditions, the understandable urge to use untested interventions, employee and equipment shortages, risk of health care worker infection, and research staff deployment to provide clinical care. The influenza A (H1N1) pandemic was an unwelcome reminder of the need to reduce regulatory redundancy and develop protocols, including \u201csleeper trials\u201d in advance of when they would be required, to accelerate the acquisition of answers once a pandemic arrives.4 Even in settings with preparedness planning, the pace of the COVID-19 pandemic may preclude some newly coordinated trials from culminating in robust results. Early efforts have already been published, such as the randomized trial by Cao and colleagues that tested the combined protease inhibitors lopinavir and ritonavir.5 Many other trials are forthcoming.\nRising to the challenge of rapidly launched and interpreted treatment trials, adaptive trial designs can accelerate the evaluation of COVID-19 therapies.3 Adaptive trials hold the promise of minimizing harm to participants by exposing fewer patients to the treatment burdens and risks, while maximizing treatment benefits for the greatest number of participants.6 Protocol modifications are expected rather than discouraged while adaptive trials are underway, such as enriching, refining, or repressing enrollment of patients with particular genetic, biological, physiological, or clinical profiles. Anticipated modification to the interventions being evaluated in adaptive trials are additions (newly identified auspicious therapies); adjustments (changes to or deletion of unfavorable drugs or devices); and abandonment (for reasons of benefit, harm, futility, or supply shortages).\nThe Randomized Embedded Multifactorial Adaptive Platform trial for Community-Acquired Pneumonia (REMAP-CAP), for example, was conceived in the wake of the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic for the express purpose of having a randomized trial actively recruiting patients at the onset of the next pandemic.7 REMAP-CAP has now shifted its focus to COVID-19 and is actively recruiting patients in the European Union, UK, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and Saudi Arabia. New domains relevant to the emerging understanding of COVID-19 disease are being developed and integrated. With hope and a leap of faith in this pandemic, participants will consent to eventualities that neither they, nor the investigators, may fully envision. Trials not yet launched will benefit from early decisions made in adaptive trials already launched. Data and safety monitoring boards will shoulder difficult decisions. In this light, open data sharing will take on a renewed sense of purpose.\nMany other national and international research efforts are underway. Leaders of international investigator-led clinical research consortia8 and critical care clinicians9 have joined to promote a scientifically rigorous, geopolitically inclusive, and academically collegial response to this pandemic challenge. Rather than driven by individual investigators or a small number of consortia, the blueprint for another adaptive randomized global platform trial is now established and a growing number of countries have committed to contribute to this alliance by merging with this World Health Organization\u2013led trial, aptly named SOLIDARITY.10 Effectiveness will be examined through frequent interim analyses so that the most promising therapies will continue to be evaluated while the least effective are discarded. This \u201ccontinually learning trial\u201d may prove to be one of the largest international platform trials conducted in a pandemic period and represents an aspirational approach of universally coordinated efforts to help treat those affected by COVID-19.\nAs described by Grasselli et al,1 the number of critically ill patients presenting to Italian hospitals\u2014as in China, Iran, Europe, and now many cities in the US\u2014highlights the fragility of health care systems to care for the most severely ill patients in even the wealthiest countries. It has been estimated that, just over a century ago, approximately 3% of the world\u2019s population died as a result of the 1918 pandemic influenza.11 In modern times, many of these patients would survive if they could be treated in an ICU. Much of the world still lacks that resource12 and patients fare worse in pandemic periods in such settings.13 However, without space in hospitals, and with insufficient ventilators and other life support measures, personnel, and protective equipment, the ability to support patients with COVID-19 is threatened everywhere. The moral distress of rationing health care resources is inevitable in many corners of the world during this pandemic.14\nPandemics do not affect all locations with the same intensity at the same time. By calling forth shared humanity in the face of COVID-19\u2013related morbidity and mortality, supporting close and distant neighbors reciprocally, and encouraging practical, creative solutions,15 the pandemic burden may be attenuated. Taking this road less traveled demands a different kind of solidarity: care without borders to help those in need when they need it most.\nMonths ago, there was no clear indication that COVID-19 was coming. Today there is no clear indication of how or when it will end. An extraordinary ferment of courage, compassion, and collaboration will be essential to fuel an effective multifaceted response to this devastating pandemic.\nBack to top\nArticle Information\nCorresponding Author: Deborah J.

But this relationship is not particularly stable. Like all living substances, viruses mutate, sometimes in ways that cause explosive, severe disease. Viral outbreaks have killed off virtually entire populations, as happened when measles was first introduced into the previously naive population of the Faroe Islands, or when Europeans brought smallpox to North America. Humankind, as a whole, has survived evolving viral threats by evolving with them; prior exposure to related viruses produces varying degrees of resistance (immunity) to new strains. Humans with less resistance die, often despite modern medical intervention, while others remain entirely asymptomatic. Medical interventions (principally vaccines) and stringent public health measures have often altered the outcome, but not necessarily in predictable ways.\nThe last \u201cgreat\u201d pandemic was the 1918 influenza pandemic that killed an estimated 20 to 50 million people worldwide. Its spread was enhanced by troop movements during World War I. The young, perhaps because of their more vigorous immune response, were disproportionately affected, dying from exuberant pulmonary exudation.1\nAs I compose this article, in mid-March 2020, the World Health Organization has just proclaimed the latest outbreak, termed novel coronavirus 19 (COVID-19), a global pandemic, the president of the United Sates has declared a national emergency, and all of Italy is locked down to contain its spread. Its future course and duration remain unknown. Estimates of case fatality range from 1% to 5% (10-50 times the mortality rate of seasonal influenza, although the real rate will only be known once we conduct serosurveys to determine the frequency of asymptomatic infections) and the elderly are at the greatest risk of severe disease and death. Modern air travel facilitated global dissemination within a very few months of its origins in Hubei province, China. This issue of JAMA Ophthalmology brings us necessarily preliminary but valuable insights from the front line.2 Wu et al2 examined the conjunctiva of 38 patients hospitalized in Hubei province, China, with presumed COVID-19. Conjunctivitis was present in 12 (32%) and it was most evident and severe in the sickest patients. The virus was detectable on swabs of the conjunctiva of 2 of 11 patients tested (18%). These 2 also yielded positive nasopharyngeal swab results (100%), whereas only 28 of the 38 patients (74%) did. No other ocular parameters were investigated.\nThe primary importance of this finding is epidemiologic: it confirms other reports that the virus can invade the conjunctiva, which might, in turn, serve as a source of its spread. Containing viral spread is the primary means by which we protect people and populations from newly emerging infections. Seasonal influenza is minimized (although rarely contained) by a global system that tracks emerging new strains and uses these to develop better-matched vaccines (of variable efficacy).3 The 2010 SARS outbreak, caused by another coronavirus, was a bullet we dodged. Highly lethal, far more so than COVID-19, it was not nearly as communicable. This explains why those at highest risk of infection were hospital workers, who were in close contact with infected patients, and why vigorous containment procedures were able to mitigate what might otherwise have become a disastrous pandemic.\nChina, where the virus first transferred from its natural animal reservoir (generally thought to be bats4) to humans, experienced an explosive epidemic that strict quarantine measures largely contained (with more than 80 000 clinical cases and 3180 deaths5). But the rest of the world did little to anticipate and contain its introduction and local spread until it became a pandemic. Effective containment requires an understanding of a virus\u2019s mode of transmission and rapid and vigorous use of appropriate interventions designed to stop it. Unfortunately, this is a lesson we keep forgetting.\nBiomedical science has provided us increasingly effective antimicrobial defenses from antibiotics to vaccines. But microbes continuously evolve; our defenses must evolve with them. The power of vaccines and antimicrobials repeatedly elicit a false sense of security: in 1967, then-US Surgeon General William H. Stewart allegedly assured Congress, \u201cIt\u2019s time to close the book on infectious disease.\u201d6 We keep making the same mistake: underestimating the threat of new infectious agents and failing to implement public health interventions as rapidly and vigorously as required.\nIronically, the earliest cries of alarm about COVID-19 were made by Dr Li Wenliang, a Chinese ophthalmologist caring for patients in Wuhan. He earned the ire of the Chinese government for alerting the public and calling for action. He died at age 34 years from the disease.7 We do not know whether he became infected from contact with patients\u2019 eyes.\nBack to top\nArticle Information\nCorresponding Author: Alfred Sommer, MD, MHS, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, 615 N.

Coronavirus: whistle-blower Dr Li Wenliang confirmed dead of the disease at 34, after hours of chaotic messaging from hospital. Accessed March 14, 2020. https://www.scmp.com/news/china/society/article/3049411/coronavirus-li-wenliang-doctor-who-alerted-authorities-outbreak", "jama.2020.5910": "F\nor decades, leading scientists and influential professional societies have warned of the dangers of emerging infections and the specter of a global pandemic.1,2 The emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and its subsequent spread has lived up to and surpassed many of the warnings and has caused an evolving global public health and economic crisis. Significantly, no pharmaceutical agents are known to be safe and effective at preventing or treating coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the resulting illness.3 This leaves the medical and public health community with only nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) to rely on for reducing the burden of COVID-19. These measures aim to reduce disease transmission both locally and globally and include bans on public gatherings, compulsory stay-at-home policies, mandating closures of schools and nonessential businesses, face mask ordinances, quarantine and cordon sanitaire (ie, a defined quarantine area from which those inside are not allowed to leave), among others. The effectiveness of NPIs has been studied theoretically,4 especially within the context of pandemic influenza, and also through analysis of historical observational data.5-7 A common finding of these studies is that implementing NPIs, especially when done rapidly after initial detection of a new contagious pathogen, can reduce transmission.\nIn a study published in JAMA, Pan et al8 examined the epidemiologic outcomes following implementation of NPIs during the COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan, China, shortly after the disease was identified. From a cohort of 32\u202f583 patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection in Wuhan, the authors computed standardized number of infections per day per million people, effective reproduction numbers, and the proportion of severe disease in cases spanning the period December 2019 through early March 2020. Importantly, this time span was separated into 5 distinct periods, each characterized by different combinations and applications of public health measures: before January 10 (no intervention), January 10 to 22 (movement of large numbers of people for the Chinese New Year holiday), January 23 to February 1 (city lockdown with traffic restriction, home quarantine, cordons sanitaire), February 2 to 16 (intensified social distancing measures, centralized quarantine and treatment), and February 17 to March 8 (door-to-door and individual-to-individual community screening for symptoms in all residents).\nBased on their sophisticated evaluation, Pan et al suggest that this series of multifaceted NPIs was associated with improved control of the COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan. The daily confirmed case rate per million people increased from 2.0 before January 10, to 45.9 between January 10 and 22, and to 162.6 between January 23 and February 1. The rate then decreased to 77.9 between February 2 and 16 and to 17.2 after February 16. In addition, the proportion of severe or critical cases decreased gradually over time: 53.1%, 35.1%, 23.5%, 15.9%, and 10.3%, respectively, for the 5 periods.\nThe study is remarkable in several ways. Pan et al applied surveillance data to quantify the time evolution of COVID-19 transmission intensity through the different periods in their study. In doing so, they recognize the implicit goal of any contagious disease intervention: interrupt the chain of transmission by reducing the average number of cases caused by each infected individual over their infectious period, the effective reproduction number, Rt, to less than 1.0. The authors\u2019 estimation of Rt throughout the study illustrates a striking association between NPIs employed in Wuhan, especially during the third period of their study when the city was under cordons sanitaire, automobile traffic was suspended, and quarantine of confirmed and presumptive cases and their close contacts were enforced. Given the delays the authors observed between symptom onset and laboratory confirmation and an incubation period of roughly 5 days,9 it is difficult to assert that additional interventions in periods 4 and 5 were necessary in driving Rt below 1.0, although transmission did continue to decline further as additional measures were implemented. Thus, it appears that strict travel restrictions and home quarantine were the dominant factors associated with reducing Rt to less than 1.0 in the early days of the Wuhan outbreak.\nPan et al8 also present new epidemiological data on COVID-19, stratified by age group and sex, and illustrate substantially elevated risk among health care workers who cared for patients with COVID-19 during the early days of the outbreak. Increased testing throughout their study period revealed higher rates of infection among younger persons in Wuhan than has been previously reported. Perhaps most concerning was the high infection rate among those younger than 1 year (13.4 per million), which was found to fall between those observed for persons aged 20 through 39 years (12.7 per million) and 40 to 59 years (19.4 per million). This may have important implications for ongoing and potential future nonpharmaceutical bundles in the US and other nations with respect to daycare for children in this age group. Pan et al also observed that males were at higher risk than females for severe disease, with females in this study having a 10% lower risk of severe or critical infection, a finding consistent with other recent observations.10\nAn important question unresolved in the absence of population immunological surveys concerns the role that immunity may have had in the observed decreased rates of infection and Rt. Until the extent and persistence of SARS-CoV-2 immunity is understood, however, there is an acute need to better understand the roles that quarantine, cordons sanitaire, and the suspension of within- and between-city travel restrictions have in the control of COVID-19. The work of Pan et al suggests that cordons sanitaire, suspension of automobile traffic, and quarantine of all confirmed and potential cases and exposed persons was sufficient to reduce Rt to less than 1.0. Thus, it will be important to determine which of these components is necessary to break the chain of transmission because implementation of some of these measures may encounter legal and ethical challenges if applied elsewhere.11 Analysis of current public health responses to intense transmission of SARS-CoV-2 across the globe will soon reveal if variably applied \u201cshelter-at-home\u201d policies can effectively replace mass quarantine of cities. Beyond the current phase of the pandemic, it may be necessary to mass quarantine geographic \u201chot spots\u201d to limit spreading to other regions in potential future waves of COVID-19.12 Such decisions will depend on many factors, including the availability of rapid testing and serological surveys to accurately measure population immunity.\nTaken as a whole, the study by Pan et al8 hints at a tantalizing possibility: the accessibility of data to support the real-time formative evaluation of public health interventions in an ongoing pandemic. Monitoring infection rates and effective reproduction numbers continuously may effectively allow for quality improvement methods to be used to evaluate public health policies, provided data can be drawn continuously from different sources. Regardless, for the time being, NPIs are the only tool in the armamentarium for controlling COVID-19, and this report in JAMA serves to quantify important metrics suggesting their potential effectiveness. As it appears that the US and other nations will be living with NPIs to varying degrees during the immediate future,13,14 the suggestion that their application can quickly reduce COVID-19 transmission if applied effectively is reassuring.\nBack to top\nArticle Information\nCorresponding Author: Eli N.

The once-boisterous streets of New York City are quiet, while the hospital wards reverberate with the swooshes and beeps usually heard in intensive care units (ICUs). COVID-19 echoes that duality. There are so many outside the hospital who have been silently infected, while so many are fighting for their lives in the hospital, struggling just to breathe.\nThe public hospitals of New York City have seen scourges for centuries: from yellow fever in the 18th century, cholera in the 19th, HIV/AIDS in the 20th, and Ebola just a few years ago. Although surviving past epidemics provides confidence that society will survive this one as well, each epidemic has challenged individuals in different ways. Prior experiences provide little guidance on the how to get through this one. Nonetheless, each day more is learned more about COVID-19, and by sharing early reflections from the epicenter of the US epidemic\u2014New York City\u2014other parts of the country and the world may be helped that are confronting the same suffering.\nPublic Health and Health Care Delivery Are Intertwined\nNew York City is fortunate to have a world-class public health department. The link between public health and health care delivery has always been important for policy and environmental approaches to complement clinical care. But COVID-19 has brought this into sharp relief. The effectiveness of social distancing translates directly into the number of sick patients in the emergency departments and intensive care units.\nIn an open letter to fellow New Yorkers, thousands of emergency department clinicians urged people to \u201cstay home as much as possible and only go out for essential supplies like groceries. This type of isolation is difficult, but we assure you it will save others. Don\u2019t cut corners.\u201d\nCollaboration between public health and health care is also vital for ensuring that policy on COVID-19 restrictions adequately consider health care workers\u2019 unique position in the crisis. For example, in closing New York City public schools, the city opened enrichment centers where the children of first responders could go during the day, so their parents would still be able to do their jobs.\nThe Primacy of Clinician Morale\nFlattening the curve, raising the line, and other shorthand for COVID-19 strategies sometimes overlook how fundamentally important morale is. If clinicians lose trust or motivation, the health care system buckles, no matter how many beds are available. Just as leaders are responsible for sourcing sufficient ventilators and N95 respirators, they also must have a pulse on morale, particularly because health care workers are risking themselves and their families.\nAdrenaline got people through the first few days, but COVID-19 is different from 9/11 and Superstorm Sandy in that it requires much greater endurance of clinicians. In the face of overwhelming tragedy, celebrating victories, like playing music throughout the hospital marking each extubation, or tracking the number of people on a board who have recovered from COVID-19, bolsters spirits. The strongest possible motivation for health care workers to toil under difficult, sometimes perilous, conditions is knowing that they are saving lives.\nHealth Equity Is not a Sideshow During COVID-19, It Is the Main Event\nMultiple signals emerging in COVID-19 outcomes confirm what has been seen before: in times of crisis, those already living on the margins are most likely to be harmed. Why did one New York City borough, Queens, bear the brunt of the first wave of COVID-19? The full story will take time to understand, but the residents of Queens include many low-income and immigrant families, who live in multigenerational and often crowded housing, experience a greater burden of underlying comorbidities like diabetes, and have available to them fewer hospital beds per capita. Risk factors converge in particular for immigrants, who often work in jobs now deemed to be essential, like stocking the bodegas that all rely on.\nThe story has begun to unravel of why certain ethnicities, particularly Latinos, are more likely to have catastrophic outcomes from COVID-19, and it has been hypothesized that poverty, tobacco use, nutrition, and chronic stress are part of the equation\u2014perhaps made worse by federal anti-immigrant policies. The worry is that the same communities will suffer effects from the predicted second pandemic related to foregone chronic care\u2014as well as unintended consequences from necessary social distancing, such as lost wages for restaurant workers and subpar education for children with limited internet access.\nMoving Beyond Analytics to Intelligence\nThe COVID-19 military metaphor \u201cfrom the frontlines\u201d often felt overwrought for people more used to being healers than warriors. But the idea that beyond data or analytics, the need intelligence for sound decision-making feels true.\nFor instance, at NYC Health + Hospitals, the total numbers of patients with COVID-19 are tracked in the emergency departments, inpatient wards, and ICUs. However, half of the patients with COVID-19 were admitted in one of the emergency departments at one point, but another hospital had turned an endoscopy suite into an ICU. Keeping track of the numbers of patients requires triangulating with rapid changes on the ground, both with physical walkthroughs as well as real-time communication (good old-fashioned telephone calls). Accurately tracking bed capacity and availability becomes a matter of life and death when one hospital encounters a surge and needs to draw upon others for help with the influx.\nRobust intelligence also helps to take on important unanswered questions, such as what is happening with patients without COVID-19, many of whom seem to be missing or at least delaying seeking care. In the same vein, the most important consideration in working with projection models for COVID-19 surge planning has been feeding back actual data to recalibrate models. Understanding why some models predicted a need for 4 times as many ventilators as what are currently being used helps to forecast better\u2014a matter of trust.\nA final lesson from these efforts has been interrogating reactions to potentially promising results, from discerning how much to glean from an uncontrolled case series of COVID-19 treatments to finding positive trends in otherwise bereft data. One person\u2019s confirmation bias is another person\u2019s glimmer of hope.\nDespite the physical isolation associated with COVID-19, it has crystallized how society is \u201ccaught in an inescapable network of mutuality,\u201d to invoke Martin Luther King Jr. This has been felt in New York City and a virtual platform was launched for physicians to share clinical observations and best practices across hospitals, using the Project ECHO model.\nBut the network must be global. In the same way clinicians in New York City have learned from experiences in China, Italy, and Seattle, everyone has to continue paying it forward. This requires not only the rigor needed for all of sound science, but also more widespread collaboration, and accelerating the translation of research into benefits for patients.\nArticle Information\nCorresponding Author: Dave A.

Such older adults are at high risk of dying from COVID-19.1 Yet they also have high rates of morbidity and mortality from other acute and chronic conditions\u2014and may adapt poorly to aggressive physical distancing and the changing health system structures that accompany it. In this Viewpoint, we highlight the health challenges for community-dwelling older adults and offer targeted suggestions for actions clinicians can take to mitigate these threats.\nAlthough loneliness and depression may result from or coexist with social isolation, they only represent the tip of the iceberg of potential harm. For many older adults, health is influenced more by their daily lives than by medical interventions. Changes in the types of foods eaten due to changes in food availability during shelter-in-place orders may precipitate the exacerbation of heart failure, for example. Lack of exercise due to isolating at home may lead to deconditioning with subsequent weakness and falls. Reduction in the cognitive stimulation that comes with socializing and engaging with the wider world may worsen cognitive and behavioral symptoms of dementia.2 Older adults with medical, cognitive, or social frailty have less reserve to compensate when their homeostasis is threatened. When facing the challenges of social isolation, they are particularly vulnerable to rapid declines.\nWithdrawal of the formal and informal functional supports on which many vulnerable older adults rely may compound these problems. These supports can make all the difference between staying in their home or ending up in a hospital, residential care, or long-term care facility. Although policies and practices for those who provide professional services for older adults continue to evolve, many have substantially cut back on in-home supportive services, adult day health care, and other programs. Family and friends who have served as caregivers may be afraid or unable to visit. While it has been heartening to see voluntary networks spring up to help older adults buy groceries and the like, other basic needs such as assistance with bathing, basic home cleaning, and dementia supports may be unmet.\nFinally, when declines in health occur, fear of going to medical facilities may prevent people from receiving the care they need\u2014a likely contributor to anecdotal reports of marked declines in hospitalization for non-COVID serious illness that have been observed in some hospitals. Moreover, the telephone and video substitutes for in-person evaluation pose special challenges for some older adults. Hearing loss, cognitive impairment, and unfamiliarity with new technology may compromise their ability to effectively use these modalities. These technology platforms have not been rigorously evaluated in older adults and may not be configured for easy use.3 Yet for many older adults they have become the sole source of connection with the health care system.\nAll is not doom and gloom, however. Although social and health system realignments in response to COVID-19 are unavoidable, clinicians can help reduce their potentially negative effects on the health of older adults by identifying and addressing the risks and helping patients compensate.\nFirst, telephone or video visits may be improved with simple, common sense interventions. Ensure that vulnerable patients are wearing their hearing aids (or using telephonic adaptive devices, if they have them). Enlist the help of a family member, friend, paid caregiver, or staff member in advance of the visit to familiarize older adults with video-call technology. By practicing ahead of time, the UCSF Care at Home program has rapidly increased utilization of such technologies. It may also be useful to engage caregivers in a visit through a 3-way call, which can be done using apps such as Facetime or Skype, which can be used during the COVID-19 national health emergency as part of the expanded Medicare telemedicine services.4\nTelemedicine only goes so far, however. There is a risk that reflexive thinking and fear among both clinicians and patients may override clinical common sense about which in-person visits are in fact essential. Clinicians should be mindful of this potential cognitive trap and advise their patients to avoid it as well. When a trip to the clinic or lab may be particularly risky or challenging, creative solutions such as home health nursing evaluation, phlebotomy, or a house call (while maintaining stringent infection control safeguards) should be considered.\nSecond, when meeting with older patients face-to-face or virtually, clinicians should inquire about unmet social or functional needs. Have informal or formal services and supports been withdrawn, and, if so, how is the person managing? How is the person getting food and staying active? If answers are concerning, additional or novel supports such as home meal delivery or emergency on-call home care services should be considered, with health system social workers and Area Agencies on Aging often having the best knowledge of options.5 Early identification of these issues may help prevent hospitalizations. Where appropriate, patients should also be encouraged to accept available home care services, which may be essential to preserve their health, but which they may have previously declined because of concerns about exposure to COVID-19. Health systems and local agencies that assist older adults should coordinate their efforts to identify and proactively reach out to help those at the highest risk of poor health outcomes.\nThird, a focus on COVID-19 should not short-circuit diagnostic reasoning. Some people with fever and cough will have bacterial pneumonia. And, although there are concerns about COVID-19\u2013related myocarditis masquerading as non\u2013ST elevation myocardial infarction, many people with troponin elevations and characteristic electrocardiographic findings will have coronary disease. When seeing a patient in whom COVID-19 is being considered, a \u201cCOVID time-out\u201d should be taken, to consider alternative diagnoses. Conversely, because older adults can present with atypical symptoms of infection such as delirium and fail to show classic symptoms such as fever, it is important to keep infections, including COVID-19, on the differential diagnosis until a clear cause of symptoms emerges.6 As the prevalence of COVID-19 increases, some patients may also present with both COVID-19 and another problem, for example heart failure or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbated by COVID-19 infection.\nFourth, as health systems prioritize the care of patients with COVID-19 by delaying elective procedures, administrators and the leaders of these systems should recognize that a procedure considered elective in a young person may be urgent or an emergency for an older adult. An example is a patient who has dementia and a percutaneous biliary drain and who is waiting for definitive endoscopic treatment for choledocholithiasis. If such a patient were to repeatedly pull on and dislodge the drain, despite the efforts of the family and visiting nurse in the face of physical distancing, definitive treatment with a procedure that in other circumstances is elective would be preferable to multiple visits to the emergency department. Moreover, caregiving and transportation difficulties, complex decision-making about goals of care and the appropriateness of interventions, and related challenges can put older adults at a disadvantage when \u201cgetting in line\u201d as capacity for medical procedures becomes available.7 There are no easy answers, and difficult decisions need to be made about the use of scarce medical resources and the challenges for postprocedural care. Greater attention to issues of aging can be facilitated by including in the decision-making geriatricians and other clinicians who have assumed greater responsibility for the care of older adults. Improved decision-making should reduce the risks of unfairly disadvantaging or misaligning care for older adults.\nAlthough older adults living in the community are highly susceptible to death from COVID-19, their non\u2013COVID-19 care should not be forgotten. Physical distancing and social isolation may take a heavy toll not only on their mental health, but also on their physical health and functioning. In responding to the pandemic, it is essential to be mindful of the challenges that physical distancing is creating for vulnerable older adults and to address these challenges head on.\nBack to top\nArticle Information\nCorresponding Author: Michael A.

By providing insight into false-positives, test specificity also poses implications for how policy makers understand the true scope of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). No test is ironclad, and thoughtful approaches require considering the limitations of whatever testing capacity is created.\nThe salience of these points has been highlighted in several analyses evaluating the diagnostic yield of SARS-CoV-2 tests.2,3 A study published in JAMA from a research group in China2 reported yield from reverse transcription\u2013polymerase chain reaction testing\u2014the most widely used test to date\u2014collected from different sources among 205 hospitalized patients with COVID-19. The proportion of positive tests varied by source, ranging from 93.3% (14 of 15) for bronchoalveolar lavage to 69.2% (72 of 104) for sputum, 62.5% (5 of 8) for nasal, and 31.7% (126 of 398) for pharyngeal samples. Although the study possessed several limitations and could not determine reverse transcription\u2013polymerase chain reaction testing sensitivity because of the lack of a criterion-standard comparison, it nonetheless raised questions about test performance and highlighted several overarching priorities in the US approach to SARS-CoV-2 testing.\nTest Characteristics and Yield\nTo date, media reports and announcements describing new tests have not been accompanied by easily accessible information regarding their characteristics or diagnostic yield. This information is also difficult to find independently via web searches. While we are in the early stages of a fight against an unfamiliar foe, the focus on test characteristics and diagnostic yield should not be lost in the shuffle of ramping up testing capacity. Instead, these data should be prioritized in research and made widely available by all groups performing and interpreting tests as quickly as possible. For instance, policy makers should ensure that steps taken to speed the expansion of test capacity (eg, emergency use authorizations for new tests) incorporate processes that require both calculation and timely release of test characteristic information.\nPotentially Poor Yield or Test Performance\nResults based on tests with poor yield or performance characteristics could inadvertently provide inappropriate reassurance to policy makers, public health officials, clinicians, and patients. The caveats of existing analyses notwithstanding, they bring into question the utility of nasopharyngeal swabs as a widely used and promulgated testing option.\nIn health care settings, false-negatives could lead to premature abandonment of precautions\u2014a particularly problematic issue given current and projected nationwide shortages in personal protective equipment. Appropriate precautions and protective equipment are needed to prevent both viral transmission to the health care workforce and to other otherwise unexposed patients via this frontline group. These are top priority efforts that would be aided by more information regarding diagnostic test characteristics and yield.\nIn community settings, the issues of poor sensitivity and/or test yield may become more relevant with the increased availability of home testing kits, as understandably inexperienced individuals may drive false-negatives by failing to adequately self-swab. Given the consequences of community viral transmission, the implications of using such tests to rule out individuals who in fact have disease could be staggering if negative test results prompt them to inappropriately relax social distancing practices.\nA solution being promulgated by policy makers and institutions is serial testing (eg, discontinuing precautions based on sequentially negative tests). This approach could be beneficial for tests with low or unknown sensitivity or specificity and would align with influenza testing guidelines. Using multiple tests from different sampling sites would be another alternative. Data on the benefit of these approaches, which are currently lacking, are needed.\nBalancing Patient Care and Clinician Safety\nTesting strategies for SARS-CoV-2 can and should evolve as we continue to learn more about the virus and associated disease. As this occurs, it should be a top policy priority to balance the benefits of diagnosing cases with maintaining clinician safety. For example, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention currently recommends diagnosis via lower respiratory tract specimens, such as lower respiratory tract aspirate or bronchoalveolar lavage. While it would be straightforward to obtain samples from intubated patients and yield may be higher for these sample types than others,2 both would be aerosolizing procedures that potentially increase the risk of transmission to health care professionals.\nThe balance between diagnostic benefits and workforce safety is likely to vary by clinical scenario. For instance, even acknowledging their risks, lower respiratory aspirates may be needed in populations such as hospitalized patients who have more severe disease and high suspicion of disease despite negative tests based on nasopharyngeal swabs. In contrast, less invasive nasopharyngeal tests could be more appropriate for individuals with lower risk.\nUltimately, testing policies should be informed by data about test characteristics and yield given the clinical salience of test results. For instance, test results in the outpatient setting can affect counseling with respect to home isolation, while results in the hospital setting can guide specific laboratory testing (eg, interleukin 6), experimental therapy (eg, tocilizumab), and decisions related to intubation, droplet isolation precautions, and clearance of infection.\nConclusion\nWe are in uncharted territory trying to mitigate the consequences of an unfamiliar foe affecting populations the world over. However, policy makers and leaders have the opportunity to implement thoughtful testing policies as they increase testing capacity. Information about test characteristics and yield from different sample sites is needed to balance diagnostic benefit and clinician safety and to form the basis for testing policies that can help us most effectively respond to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nArticle Information\nCorresponding Author: Leah M.

But what is the appropriate response for people with positive antibody tests?\nSome European countries are considering serological tests to issue immunity certifications (passports) that give holders certain time-limited work and social freedoms, joining larger gatherings or returning to nonessential jobs,3 and the US government is considering similar proposals.4 Certifications commonly form part of infection control strategies in other settings; eg, states prescribe vaccine requirements for childcare and health care workers. Public health screening programs require schoolteachers prove they do not have tuberculosis. Many countries require visitors to show a yellow fever vaccination certificate.\nHowever, an immunity certificate program for COVID-19 would be unparalleled in several ways. First, because COVID-19 is not (yet) vaccine-preventable, inoculation must come entirely from prior infection. Second, the program likely would apply more broadly than to only a handful of selected professions or activities. Third, the conditioned \u201cprivileges\u201d could include a greater range of fundamental civil liberties and opportunities, like freedom of association, worship, work, education, and travel. In addition, scientific understanding of SARS-CoV-2 immunity is still fairly rudimentary. How much immunity infection confers, and for how long, is unknown, as is the level and type of antibodies that indicate immunity.5\nIdeally, clearer scientific understanding and careful deliberation would precede any public or private policy that selectively relaxes restrictions based on positive tests for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies.6 However, the ideal of a measured, evidence-based approach to policy making appears likely to be overrun by hopes and demands for antibody testing. Antibody tests are proliferating.3 Following the slow and inefficient roll-out of viral testing, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) initially announced that antibody tests could be marketed without prior approval so long as users receive appropriate disclaimers.3 The agency recently amended its stance to permit preapproval distribution by commercial manufacturers only while seeking FDA approval. Under this permissive approach, dozens of unproven antibody tests, many manufactured in other countries, are now available and being marketed aggressively.\nThe coming surge in availability of antibody tests will meet huge demand. People who have had COVID-19 disease want to learn if they now are protected, and many others will want to learn if they acquired immunity asymptomatically or following mild illness. Thus, inevitably, society will need to react before scientific and public policy consensus forms. Positive antibody test results will induce behavior modification and reduce compliance with restrictions. Even without authorized immunity certification, people will begin to self-certify, with much less accuracy and credibility than if certification were official. The rapidly unfolding situation raises a host of important legal, ethical, and policy concerns that will not wait for greater scientific certainty.\nInequitable Access to Testing\nBestowing immunity certification for work, school, worship, romance, or other highly valued human interactions demands fair access to testing. In the ramp-up phase when supplies are limited, reliable antibody testing should be prioritized as virus testing has been, primarily for front-line health care workers and first responders. Other essential workers should be next in line as testing capacity expands.\nOnce reliable tests are more widely available, affordability should not skew access. Fortunately, various legal mandates, including the recent Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security (CARES) Act, require private and public insurers to pay for all professional SARS-CoV-2 testing, including antibody tests, and reimburse hospitals for testing uninsured patients. Remarkably, the US is close to universal, first-dollar coverage for novel coronavirus testing.\nInvidious Discrimination\nDespite palpable ethical concerns, there appear to be few or no legal obstacles to government or private adoption of immunity certification policies, provided they are implemented thoughtfully. Health certification is an established tool in disease control and has not provoked legal controversy when used in accordance with expert guidance to counteract substantial infection risks. Government programs that confer selective advantage may well encounter constitutional challenge for denying equal protection, but in crisis situations courts are highly deferential.1 Although certification discriminates by design, discrimination is not legally or ethically problematic unless it lacks good rationale. Indeed, when substantially different circumstances exist, it can be wrong not to differentiate. Only when differentiation is invidious (ie, unjustified, and thus imposing undeserved hardship) is it wrongly discriminatory.\nDisability discrimination law has more direct relevance than constitutional law. Governing principles are not fully settled,6 but recent federal guidance on COVID-19 allows employers to require workers \u201cto provide a doctor\u2019s note certifying fitness to return to work.\u201d7 Also, allowing workers to establish immunity voluntarily could be viewed as a \u201creasonable accommodation\u201d or job safety protection that employers must adopt for workplaces that otherwise might pose excessive risk.\nSocial Class Disparities\nEven when differentiating is legal, it can still be unfair. Certifying those who are fit may stigmatize those who are not. There is ample historical evidence that tying advantage to fitness can amplify existing socioeconomic disparities. At the extreme, critics warn that excessive immunity advantages could create an Orwellian or dystopian social apartheid.8 Those are serious concerns, but the picture is more nuanced.\nUnlike most other social disparities, immunity advantages are unlikely to create a permanent underclass. They are transitional to an effective vaccine or treatment or to herd immunity. Yet, advantages conferred by immunity are likely to have the unusual characteristic of partially remediating disparities wrought by the pandemic. For instance, black individuals appear to have been infected at a higher rate than white individuals in many cities.9 Spread of COVID-19 likely tracked a familiar socioeconomic gradient, with a disproportionate burden of illness affecting lower-income individuals, owing to denser living conditions, front-line \u201cessential\u201d jobs that required attendance and repeated exposure, and higher rates of preexisting chronic health conditions (partly due to structural inequities). It should follow that antibodies are more prevalent in these same populations. By conferring temporary advantages, accurate immunity certification could have a progressive valence that, conceivably, operates more as a leveler than class divider.\nImmunity certification can confer not only privilege but also the opportunity to take on greater responsibility in the ongoing efforts to counteract COVID-19. Even without immunity testing, some patients who have had COVID-19 are eager to donate plasma, help with research studies, and take on riskier treatment roles. Immunity certification is likely to substantially increase this prosocial altruism.\nNevertheless, some of those who conscientiously followed social distancing rules may perceive that they are unfairly disadvantaged. Every selective advantage in life entails a contrasting disadvantage, some more unfair than others. An immunity advantage that permits return to normalcy may be short-lived for 2 reasons. First, SARs-CoV-2 immunity may not be long-term. Second, a vaccine will likely be available within 2 years, at which point those not previously infected certainly should have priority.\nFraud and Intentional Infection\nThoughtful implementation of immunity certification would need to guard against fraud and incentives for intentional infection. A standard set of security tools developed for other important documents could limit forgery. Intelligent design (eg, digital signatures linked to public records)4 and physician verification could help to mitigate fraud, especially if accompanied by random confirmation testing and stiff penalties for certification cheats.\nIncentives for deliberate self-infection are a more difficult problem. The behavior is reminiscent of the \u201cpox parties\u201d that some vaccine-opposed parents hold for their children. However, a lethal and unpredictable virus like COVID-19 is very different from childhood chickenpox, so it is questionable how widespread self-infection would become. In addition, social approbation can effectively deter, along with active monitoring of anti\u2013social media, as Twitter did in blocking a disreputable post promoting this practice.10 Ultimately, the US may need to tolerate some level of perverse behavior to realize the benefits of immunity, much as society tolerates but attempts to minimize destructive incentives that arise from other beneficial programs (eg, life insurance).\nStandardless Certification\nIf oversight of immunity testing and use of test results does not improve, certification programs will be vulnerable to much more serious legal and ethical objection. Regulators in the public and private sectors must step up to prevent test \u201cshopping\u201d and a \u201crace to the bottom\u201d in test quality. To be fair and effective, programs will need consensus standards for acceptable sensitivity and specificity of the tests, and systems for gathering test results to aid research and surveillance. Appropriately regulated, a certification program could actually reduce testing abuse that might otherwise occur.\nFor now, these testing issues,with unproven scientific assumptions of immunity, cast serious doubt on the merits of immunity certification. But if these issues are resolved and policies are administered fairly, the ethical and legal concerns raised may be overstated. A population-wide program of selective advantage based on disease status sounds potentially odious. But may be the policy most individuals would choose in a state of genuine uncertainty about whether or not they had acquired immunity. Immunity certification programs may have the added advantage of spurring more people to seek reliable testing, results of which will inform research and surveillance. If so, immunity privileges, although selective, could foster broader liberties and economic improvement for all.\nBack to top\nArticle Information\nCorresponding Author: Mark A.

For aerosol-generating procedures, N95 respirators, eye protection, isolation gowns, and gloves were recommended. Coveralls, boots with a cover, and hair coverings were not part of the recommended protective clothing.2,3\nWe assessed the protection of emergency physicians and nurses wearing the recommended personal protective equipment while caring for a simulated patient with respiratory distress.\nMethods\nA simulation study was conducted in the emergency department of Rambam Health Care Campus in Haifa, Israel, on March 21, 2020, examining the presence of a surrogate measure of contamination on exposed skin of participants wearing personal protective equipment to protect against SARS-CoV-2 exposure.4 Two scenarios of patients with respiratory distress requiring airway management similar to those commonly encountered in the emergency department were conducted using adult and child high-fidelity manikins (SimMan and SimJunior, Laerdal). An atomizing device (MAD Nasal, Teleflex) was used to simulate droplets exhaled during coughing episodes.5\nThe adult scenario consisted of a 74-year-old man experiencing fever and shortness of breath with a decline in oxygen saturation level prompting endotracheal intubation and peripheral intravenous cannulation. The simulation lasted 20 minutes. The simulated patient had 2 coughing episodes during which droplets were expelled from the manikin\u2019s nostrils.5 Participating health care workers were instructed to provide airway management and ventilatory support meeting the standard of care for patients with the novel coronavirus disease 2019.6\nThe intubation was performed by the most skilled physician present using a rapid-sequence intubation technique and was assisted by a second physician. Because bag-mask ventilation prior to intubation could generate aerosols, participants were allowed to use it only when preoxygenation was ineffective. One nurse was responsible for intravenous access and medication administration and a second nurse recorded and assisted with all procedures.\nThe pediatric scenario was similar. Before the simulation, a nonvisible fluorescent compound (Glo Germ) as a marker of contamination was applied on predetermined surface areas (around the nose and mouth, palms, and upper chest) of the manikin and was added to the simulated secretion areas. After completion of the simulation and before doffing, the fluorescent markers on the participants were visualized and photographed under UV light. The simulations were videotaped to capture all physical contacts between each participant and the manikin to assess possible infection risk.\nThe ethics committee of Rambam Health Care Campus waived the need for approval and consent because the study was considered a quality control project.\nResults\nFor each simulation (adult and child manikins), 2 physicians and 2 nurses participated (8 total participants). All participants were experienced in emergency department care and had participated in resuscitations.\nIn the adult scenario, intubation was successful during the second videolaryngoscopic attempt. In the pediatric scenario, intubation was successful using direct laryngoscopy after 1 failed videolaryngoscopic attempt. Seven of 8 participants had fluorescent markers on their exposed skin, 6 on the neck, and 1 on an ear (Figure).\nAll team members had fluorescent markers on their hair and 4 had markers on their shoes. During the adult and pediatric scenarios, there were 102 and 88, respectively, participant-manikin contacts.\nDiscussion\nDespite personal protective equipment, fluorescent markers were found on the uncovered skin, hair, and shoes of participants after simulations of emergency department management of patients experiencing respiratory distress. The findings suggest that the current recommendations for personal protective equipment may not fully prevent exposures in emergency department settings. Clothing that covers all skin may further diminish exposure risk.\nInhalation of aerosols and exposure risks associated with doffing were not evaluated in this study. The small number of participants, the simulated health care setting, and the surrogate measures of exposure are the primary limitations. Because this was a simulation study using manikins, it is uncertain how the results might apply to actual patient care.\nSection Editor: Jody W.

This differential ability to manage the disease will likely have a substantial influence on patient outcomes.\nFactors Associated With Requiring Intensive Care\nAppreciating typical clinical features and disease course are crucial both to prepare for increasing numbers of patients and to determine how to best treat infected persons. Patients who have required critical care have tended to be older (median age \u224860 years), and 40% have had comorbid conditions, commonly diabetes and cardiac disease.2 Children generally have been observed to experience a milder illness, although perinatal exposure may be associated with substantial risk. The small numbers of pregnant women infected thus far have had a mild course,3 but limited cases make predictions about disease course uncertain; however, severe illness in pregnant women was a major concern with influenza A(H1N1)pdm2009. The median duration between onset of symptoms and ICU admission has been 9 to 10 days, suggesting a gradual deterioration in the majority of cases.4 The most documented reason for requiring intensive care has been respiratory support, of which two-thirds of patients have met criteria for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).2\nDifferentiating From Other Diseases\nGiven the presence of a number of circulating respiratory viruses, differentiating COVID-19 from other pathogens, particularly influenza, is important and chiefly done using upper (nasopharyngeal) or lower (induced sputum, endotracheal aspirates, bronchoalveolar lavage) respiratory tract samples for reverse transcriptase\u2013polymerase chain reaction and bacterial cultures. There are suggestive but nonspecific radiographic changes, such as ground-glass opacities on computed tomography.2 Rapid access to diagnostic testing results is a public health and clinical priority, allowing for efficient patient triage and implementation of infection control practices.\nClinical Management and Outcomes\nManagement of severe COVID-19 is not different from management of most viral pneumonia causing respiratory failure (Figure). The principal feature of patients with severe disease is the development of ARDS: a syndrome characterized by acute onset of hypoxemic respiratory failure with bilateral infiltrates. Evidence-based treatment guidelines for ARDS should be followed, including conservative fluid strategies for patients without shock following initial resuscitation, empirical early antibiotics for suspected bacterial co-infection until a specific diagnosis is made, lung-protective ventilation, prone positioning, and consideration of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation for refractory hypoxemia.5\nFigure.  Summary of Caring for Critically Ill Patients With COVID-19\nView LargeDownload\nIn settings with limited access to invasive ventilation or prior to patients developing severe hypoxemic respiratory failure, there may be a role for high-flow nasal oxygen or noninvasive ventilation.6 However, the high gas flow of these 2 techniques is less contained than in the closed circuitry typical of invasive ventilators, which poses the risk of dispersion of aerosolized virus in the health care environment, such as in the setting of a poorly fitting face mask. Determining the magnitude of this risk, and mitigation strategies, is a crucial knowledge gap.\nSeptic shock and specific organ dysfunction such as acute kidney injury appear to occur in a significant proportion of patients with COVID-19\u2013related critical illness and are associated with increasing mortality, with management recommendations following available evidence-based guidelines.7\nWhile no antiviral or immunomodulatory therapies for COVID-19 have yet proven effective, a majority of severely ill patients described to date have received numerous potentially targeted therapies\u2014most commonly neuraminidase inhibitors and corticosteroids\u2014and a minority of patients have been enrolled in clinical trials.\nWhile mortality among all infected patients may be in the range of 0.5% to 4%,1 among patients who require hospitalization, mortality may be approximately 5% to 15%, and for those who become critically ill, there is currently a wide mortality range, from 22% to 62% in the early Hubei Province case series.2,4 The exact cause of death is unclear at this point, with progressive hypoxia and multiorgan dysfunction being the presumed causes. Case-fatality proportions, both among all COVID-19 patients and among severely ill patients, will likely become more precise and generalizable with increased surveillance to better clarify the number of individuals infected and as greater numbers of infections occur around the globe.\nProtecting Patients and Health Care Workers\nReducing the risk of nosocomial outbreak amplification through transmission of virus to other patients and health care workers is of critical importance. Maintaining appropriate distancing of at least 2 m between patients with suspected or confirmed to have COVID-19, consideration of use of medical masks for symptomatic patients, and, ideally, admission of patients with suspected disease to private rooms are important considerations. Ensuring hospital staff are well trained in standard, contact, and droplet infection prevention and control precautions, including the use of relevant personal protective equipment, is an imperative. Clinicians involved with aerosol-generating procedures such as endotracheal intubation and diagnostic testing using bronchoscopy should additionally use airborne precautions, including N95 respirators or equivalent face masks and face shields or goggles for eye protection.\nSurge Preparation\nIf increasing numbers of patients with COVID-19 develop severe illness, plans should be made at local and regional levels for how to best manage the potential surge in the need for critical care resources. Furthermore, if access to lifesaving interventions such as hospital beds, ventilators, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, or renal replacement therapy is likely to be strained, clear resource allocation policies should be determined by clinicians, policy makers, the general public, and ethicists. These active preparation measures can be organized well before large numbers of infected patients require hospital preparation.\nMajor Knowledge Gaps\nCOVID-19 is a novel disease with an incompletely described clinical course, especially for children and vulnerable populations. Risk factors for severe illness remain uncertain (although older age and comorbidity have emerged as likely important factors), the safety of supportive care strategies such as oxygen by high-flow nasal cannula and noninvasive ventilation are unclear, and the risk of mortality, even among critically ill patients, is uncertain. There are no proven effective specific treatment strategies, and the risk-benefit ratio for commonly used treatments such as corticosteroids is unclear.\nIt is essential to learn as much as possible through observational studies and clinical trials across a breadth of patient populations and care settings. These should incorporate clear measurements of severity of critical illness so that outcomes can be risk adjusted, and use sufficiently common outcome measures to combine data and validly compare observations across regions.8 Ideally, clinical trials should be structured to promote maximum learning from around the world, such as through the use of master protocols or adaptive platform designs.9,10\nConclusions\nIn a very short period, health care systems and society have been severely challenged by yet another emerging virus. Preventing transmission and slowing the rate of new infections are the primary goals; however, the concern of COVID-19 causing critical illness and death is at the core of public anxiety. The critical care community has enormous experience in treating severe acute respiratory infections every year, often from uncertain causes. The foundation for care of severely ill patients with COVID-19 must be grounded in this evidence base and, in parallel, ensure that learning from each patient is maximized to help those who will follow.\nBack to top\nArticle Information\nCorresponding Author: Srinivas Murthy, MD, CM, MHSc, University of British Columbia, 4500 Oak St, Vancouver, BC V6H 3V4, Canada (srinivas.murthy@cw.bc.ca).\nPublished Online: March 11, 2020. doi:10.1001/jama.2020.3633\nConflict of Interest Disclosures: Dr Gomersall reported that his department has received funding to develop educational material from Getinge, Draeger Medical, Hamilton Medical, and Fisher & Paykel.

The resulting condition, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has had a societal effect comparable only to the Spanish flu epidemic of 1918. As the flow of clinical science has better informed the contemporary narratives, more is being learned about which individuals and groups experience the most dire complications. Researchers have emphasized older age, male sex, hypertension, diabetes, obesity, concomitant cardiovascular diseases (including coronary artery disease and heart failure), and myocardial injury as important risk factors associated with worse outcomes; specifically, case-fatality rates vary over 100%.1-3 These data sourced from China and Europe have not been replicated in the US, but the US experience may nevertheless represent similarly distressing outcomes in these highest-risk phenotypes.\nThe concerns about these observations are appropriate and the published data are indeed actionable; those who fit the highest-risk phenotypes can be advised to assiduously adhere to safe practices including hand hygiene, use of masks in public spaces, and social distancing/physical isolation.4 These measures not only are flattening the curve but are no doubt saving lives. However, a new concern has arisen: evidence of potentially egregious health care disparities is now apparent. Persons who are African American or black are contracting SARS-CoV-2 at higher rates and are more likely to die.5 Why is this uniquely important to me? I am an academic cardiologist; I study health care disparities; and I am a black man.\nWhat is currently known about these differences in disease risk and fatality rates? In Chicago, more than 50% of COVID-19 cases and nearly 70% of COVID-19 deaths involve black individuals, although blacks make up only 30% of the population. Moreover, these deaths are concentrated mostly in just 5 neighborhoods on the city\u2019s South Side.6 In Louisiana, 70.5% of deaths have occurred among black persons, who represent 32.2% of the state\u2019s population.7 In Michigan, 33% of COVID-19 cases and 40% of deaths have occurred among black individuals, who represent 14% of the population.5 If New York City has become the epicenter, this disproportionate burden is validated again in underrepresented minorities, especially blacks and now Hispanics, who have accounted for 28% and 34% of deaths, respectively (population representation: 22% and 29%, respectively).8\nThe Johns Hopkins University and American Community Survey indicate that to date, of 131 predominantly black counties in the US, the infection rate is 137.5/100\u202f000 and the death rate is 6.3/100\u202f000.5 This infection rate is more than 3-fold higher than that in predominantly white counties. Moreover, this death rate for predominantly black counties is 6-fold higher than in predominantly white counties. Even though these data are preliminary and further study is warranted, the pattern is irrefutable: underrepresented minorities are developing COVID-19 infection more frequently and dying disproportionately. Do these observations qualify as evident health care disparities?\nYes. The definition of a health care disparity is not simply a difference in health outcomes by race or ethnicity, but a disproportionate difference attributable to variables other than access to care.9 Given the known risk factors for COVID-19 complications, the confluence of hypertension, diabetes, obesity, and the higher prevalence of cardiovascular disease among black persons may be driving these early signals. Data fully adjusted for comorbidities have not been reported but it is likely that some, if not most, of these differences in disease rates and outcomes will be explained by concomitant comorbidities.\nBut concerns go beyond these comorbidities. Where and how black individuals live matters. If race per se enters this discussion, it is because in so many communities, race determines home. Once adverse outcomes attributable to known risks for COVID-19 complications are disaggregated from total morbidity and mortality burden due to COVID-19, the pernicious influence of adverse social determinants of health is likely to become apparent.10 The communities where many black people reside are in poor areas characterized by high housing density, high crime rates, and poor access to healthy foods. Low socioeconomic status alone is a risk factor for total mortality independent of any other risk factors. These social determinants of health must be considered in a complex equation, including known cardiovascular risk factors, which puts underrepresented minorities who live in at-risk communities at greater risk for disease, not just for cardiovascular diseases but now for COVID-19 mortality.\nThe most effective strategy known to reduce COVID-19 infection is social distancing, but herein lies a vexing challenge. Being able to maintain social distancing while working from home, telecommuting, and accepting a furlough from work but indulging in the plethora of virtual social events are issues of privilege. In certain communities these privileges are simply not accessible. Thus, consider the aggregate of a higher burden of at-risk comorbidities, the pernicious effects of adverse social determinants of health, and the absence of privilege that does not allow a reprieve from work without dire consequences for a person\u2019s sustenance, does not allow safe practices, and does not even allow for 6-foot distancing. The consequent infection and death rates due to COVID-19 complications are no longer surprising; they should have been expected. These observations are rooted in the recalcitrant reality of the deeply entrenched history of health care disparities and may settle as the most painful example yet of the regressive tax of poor health. COVID-19 has become the herald event that now fully exposes the deep and chronic social wounds in US communities.\nWhat makes this particularly egregious is that unlike the known risk factors for which physicians and others can stridently offer clear advice regarding prevention, these concerns\u2014the burden of ill health, limited access to healthy food, housing density, the need to work or else, the inability to practice social distancing\u2014cannot be well-articulated as clear, pithy, and easily actionable items.\nWhat is the action plan? It is less an action plan and more of a commitment. A 6-fold increase in the rate of death for African Americans due to a now ubiquitous virus should be deemed unconscionable. This is a moment of ethical reckoning. The scourge of COVID-19 will end, but health care disparities will persist. Does the US chronicle these poor outcomes due to COVID-19 complications with the higher burden of cardiovascular disease, poorer outcomes for breast cancer, higher amputation rates for peripheral vascular disease, lower kidney transplant rates, and worse rates for maternal mortality, then safely park everything in the health care disparity domain and go back to \u201cnormal\u201d? Or will the nation finally hear this familiar refrain, think differently, and as has been done in response to other major diseases, declare that a civil society will no longer accept disproportionate suffering?\nPublic health is complicated and social reengineering is complex, but change of this magnitude does not happen without a new resolve. The US has needed a trigger to fully address health care disparities; COVID-19 may be that bellwether event. Certainly, within the broad and powerful economic and legislative engines of the US, there is room to definitively address a scourge even worse than COVID-19: health care disparities. It only takes will. It is time to end the refrain.\nBack to top\nArticle Information\nCorresponding Author: Clyde W.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention endorsed testing for other respiratory pathogens, suggesting that evidence of another infection could aid the evaluation of patients with potential COVID-19 in the absence of widely available rapid testing for SARS-CoV-2.3 Here we report on co-infection rates between SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory pathogens in Northern California.\nMethods\nFrom March 3 through 25, 2020, we performed real-time reverse transcriptase\u2013polymerase chain reaction tests for SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory pathogens on nasopharyngeal swabs of symptomatic patients (eg, cough, fever, dyspnea). Our laboratory (Stanford Health Care) tested specimens from multiple sites in northern California. At some sites, specimens were simultaneously tested for a panel of non\u2013SARS-CoV-2 respiratory pathogens (influenza A/B, respiratory syncytial virus, non\u2013SARS-CoV-2 Coronaviridae, adenovirus, parainfluenza 1-4, human metapneumovirus, rhinovirus/enterovirus, Chlamydia pneumoniae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae). We included only specimens from sites that tested for this panel in addition to SARS-CoV-2.\nWe calculated the proportions of specimens positive for SARS-CoV-2 and for each non\u2013SARS-CoV-2 pathogen, stratified by SARS-CoV-2 infection status. We evaluated differences in proportions with \u03c72 tests with continuity correction (significance threshold, P\u2009<\u2009.05). We calculated mean ages of patients for all subgroups and compared means with 2-sided t tests. Analyses were conducted in R version 3.6.0 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing).\nThe analysis was performed as a quality assessment of a new diagnostic test, and the study was deemed exempt from human participants protection by the Stanford University institutional review board.\nResults\nWe studied 1217 specimens tested for SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory pathogens, from 1206 unique patients; 116 of the 1217 specimens (9.5%) were positive for SARS-CoV-2 and 318 (26.1%) were positive for 1 or more non\u2013SARS-CoV-2 pathogens. Table 1 reports patient demographics and location of testing, stratified by presence of SARS-CoV-2 and non\u2013SARS-CoV-2 pathogens.\nOf the 116 specimens positive for SARS-CoV-2, 24 (20.7%) were positive for 1 or more additional pathogens, compared with 294 of the 1101 specimens (26.7%) negative for SARS-CoV-2 (Table 1) (difference, 6.0% [95% CI, \u20132.3% to 14.3%]). The most common co-infections were rhinovirus/enterovirus (6.9%), respiratory syncytial virus (5.2%), and non\u2013SARS-CoV-2 Coronaviridae (4.3%) (Table 2). None of the differences in rates of non\u2013SARS-CoV-2 pathogens between specimens positive and negative for SARS-CoV-2 were statistically significant at P\u2009<\u2009.05.\nOf 318 specimens positive for 1 or more non\u2013SARS-CoV-2 pathogens, 24 (7.5%) were also positive for SARS-CoV-2. Among 899 specimens negative for other pathogens, 92 (10.2%) were positive for SARS-CoV-2 (difference, 2.7% [95% CI, \u20131.0% to 6.4%]).\nResults were not substantially changed by restricting the analysis to 1 specimen per patient (defaulting to the second specimen when results conflicted): of 115 patients positive for SARS-CoV-2, 23 (20.0%) were positive for other pathogens, compared with 292 of 1091 patients (26.8%) negative for SARS-CoV-2 (difference, 6.8% [95% CI, \u20131.5% to 15.0%]). Of 315 patients positive for other pathogens, 23 (7.3%) were positive for SARS-CoV-2, compared with 92 of 891 patients (10.3%) negative for other pathogens (difference, 3.0% [95% CI, \u20130.7% to 6.7%]).\nPatients with co-infections did not differ significantly in age (mean, 46.9 years) from those infected with SARS-CoV-2 only (mean, 51.1 years) (difference, 4.2 [95% CI, \u20134.8 to 13.2] years).\nDiscussion\nThese results suggest higher rates of co-infection between SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory pathogens than previously reported, with no significant difference in rates of SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients with and without other pathogens. The presence of a non\u2013SARS-CoV-2 pathogen may not provide reassurance that a patient does not also have SARS-CoV-2.\nThe study is limited to a single region. Given limited sample size, restriction to multiply tested specimens, and spatiotemporal variation in viral epidemiology, the analysis is limited in the detection of specific co-infection patterns potentially predictive of SARS-CoV-2. Nonetheless, these results suggest that routine testing for non\u2013SARS-CoV-2 respiratory pathogens during the COVID-19 pandemic is unlikely to provide clinical benefit unless a positive result would change disease management (eg, neuraminidase inhibitors for influenza in appropriate patients).\nSection Editor: Jody W.

The crisis has dismantled how care is delivered and forced clinicians to make difficult triage decisions about what types and components of care have limited immediate value and which are essential for optimal outcomes. Because some malignancies could pose an immediate threat to survival, cancer provides a lens into the major shifts currently underway in clinical care. Cancer and cancer-related treatments frequently cause immunosuppression, and patients with cancer have excess mortality risk from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The magnitude of this risk is not yet known but early reports suggest a substantial increased risk of death associated with COVID-19 infection among patients with cancer, perhaps highest among those older than 60 years and those with pulmonary compromise.1,2\nThe prevailing clinical approach in medicine, the in-person visit between patient and physician, has been upended. To flatten the growth curve of the COVID-19 pandemic, physicians have postponed or canceled nonacute procedures and transitioned millions of visits to telehealth. The technology used to effect this transformation is not new, but COVID-19 has forced widespread adoption of remote encounters by video applications, patient portals, or phone calls. Patients and oncologists have rapidly adapted to this new way of communicating and many have found this approach satisfactory and sometimes preferred. Barriers to remote care previously precluded by entrenched culture or billing hurdles have quickly been surmounted.\nIn this unprecedented context, what frameworks should be used to inform decisions about how to modify cancer treatment based on patient and cancer-specific factors? Oncology care generally falls into 4 categories: First is care that is not time sensitive, can be delivered remotely, or both. This includes survivorship and surveillance visits for patients who have completed cancer treatment and have no acute symptoms to suggest recurrence. Low-risk patients receiving hormonal or oral chemotherapy also can usually be evaluated remotely, and, in most cases, blood work and imaging studies could be deferred until health system capacity has recovered.\nSecond is care that cannot be delivered remotely but for which treatment omission or delay has a marginal effect on quality or quantity of life. A sizeable proportion of oncology care involves systemic chemotherapy for patients with advanced cancer. When clinical trial data demonstrate that the incremental survival benefit of this therapy is limited, then omission or delay is appropriate given the balance of potential benefit of treatment vs the risk if the patient becomes infected with SARS-CoV-2. For example, for most metastatic solid tumors, chemotherapy beyond the third regimen does not improve survival for more than a few weeks; therefore, oncologists are advising supportive care instead. For patients receiving adjuvant therapy for curable cancers, delaying initiation or abbreviating the number of cycles is appropriate. Oncologists are postponing initiation of adjuvant chemotherapy for some estrogen receptor\u2013negative stage II breast cancers by 8 weeks and administering 6 rather than 12 cycles of adjuvant chemotherapy for stage III colorectal cancers. Because screening for breast, colorectal, lung, and prostate cancer has been halted, the proportion of screen-detected early-stage cancer is expected to decline over the next several months. Although some patients are willing to undergo treatments for small benefits, the pendulum of risk related to immunosuppression and exposure at a health care facility tip the risk-benefit ratio away from treatment. Low-grade tumors include many prostate cancers, carcinoid and neuroendocrine tumors, some thyroid cancers, some central nervous system tumors, and some lymphomas, for which treatment usually can be safely postponed by 8 to 12 weeks or longer. The COVID-19 crisis is forcing elimination of low-value treatments that were identified by the Choosing Wisely campaign, even though uptake of recommendations to eliminate these treatments has previously been adopted slowly.3\nDuring the pandemic, triage decisions require even more interspecialist coordination and communication than usual. Postponing surgery and administering neoadjuvant therapy as a bridge can decrease risk to the patient and preserve health care resources. Similarly, radiation oncologists may omit, delay, or use shorter courses to reduce the number of visits.\nThird, and most challenging, are situations for which delay has a moderate clinically important adverse influence on quality of life or survival. For example, randomized trial evidence demonstrates that 3 years of maintenance rituximab after autologous transplant for mantle cell lymphoma improves overall survival by 9%.4 Although treatment omission increases the chance of relapse, some oncologists are omitting or delaying this treatment. The incremental benefits of treatments with higher risk of infection become deprioritized, and for many cancer types, oncologists are reasonably prescribing marginally less effective regimens that have lower risk of precipitating hospitalization. Oncologists are also using white cell growth factor, more stringent neutrophil counts for proceeding with a next cycle of therapy, and omitting use of steroids to manage nausea. When possible, oncologists are substituting oral for intravenous agents and myriad other modifications to minimize visits and hospitalizations.\nFourth, and more clear, is cancer treatment that has the potential to cure and cannot safely be delayed. This includes most patients with new diagnoses of acute leukemia, high-grade lymphoma, and those with chemotherapy-responsive tumors such as testicular, ovarian, and small cell lung cancer. Despite the risks, oncologists are not modifying such treatments because these cancers are likely more lethal than COVID-19. For example, most allogeneic transplants cannot be safely postponed. Both donors and recipients are undergoing SARS-CoV-2 testing before induction starts.\nOnce a patient\u2019s cancer and perceived risk of contracting SARS-CoV-2 infection are determined, the next step is to consider the capacity of the local health care system to meet existing and projected needs. This requires knowledge about whether the system is in the preparatory, acute, or crisis phase of the pandemic. In the preparatory phase, the health care workforce is intact and hospital beds and equipment including ventilators are available. In the acute phase, the workforce has limited capacity but is functional and through strategic reorganization, there is some ability to deliver routine cancer care. In the crisis phase, the health care system is overwhelmed with COVID-19 cases and has no surplus capacity with respect to hospital beds, equipment, or staff.\nIn the first weeks of April 2020, oncologists in epicenters like New York City and Detroit are often opting for regimens with lower efficacy but lower risk of hospitalization, whereas oncologists in Denver and Raleigh have confidence\u2014at least for the moment\u2014that beds will be available and therefore have not yet had to make as many modifications. Although accrual to therapeutic trials has slowed dramatically and acquisition of biospecimens for correlative studies has largely stopped, oncologists remain focused on ensuring that clinical trial participants can continue to receive their protocol-directed therapy and evaluations where it is safe to do so. The twin goals are to minimize harms to research participants and to ensure that disruptions from the COVID-19 pandemic do not prevent the ability to test study hypotheses. Ensuring that the pandemic does not exacerbate existing disparities for cancer patients based on race, ethnicity, and class and access to specialty care is also a priority.\nOncologists report unprecedented levels of cooperation and collegiality across borders. Clinicians in Milan and Barcelona are sharing their experiences with those in Boston and San Francisco. The oncology community has united to share strategies, formulate guidance, collect data, and design and execute treatment protocols. Clinicians report deriving comfort and professional solidarity from these interactions. Consortia to identify which patients are most at risk of infection, determine how antineoplastic therapies influence the course of COVID-19 illness, and understand when it may be safe to resume treatment have proliferated with remarkable speed and receptivity.\nMany patients with cancer are concerned that their needs will be overlooked or marginalized during the COVID-19 crisis. Attending to these legitimate concerns has become, and should be, a focus. Balancing the value of cancer treatments with competing risks during a time of declining resources will increasingly present ethical and logistical challenges to clinical standards and humanism. Because most hospitals and outpatient infusion centers now prohibit visitors from accompanying patients, there is intense attention on clarifying advance directives, health care proxies, and end-of-life care preferences. Oncologists and patients must prioritize these conversations.5 However, the essential empathy of oncology practice will continue to transcend the new physical barriers presented by masks and telehealth.\nIn the space of a month, approaches and accepted norms of cancer care delivery have been transformed of necessity. Most of these changes would not have occurred without the pandemic. Although the immediate priority is to save lives, in the aftermath and recovery phase, evaluating the effects of COVID-19 on cancer mortality will be a priority. Planning for resuming cancer treatment and screening to mitigate harms is already underway. It is also likely that some changes provoked by the crisis will permanently transform how to treat cancer, in some cases perhaps for the benefit of both patients and their physicians.\nBack to top\nArticle Information\nCorresponding Author: Deborah Schrag, MD, MPH, Dana Farber Cancer Institute, 450 Brookline Ave, Boston, MA 02115 (deb_schrag@dfci.harvard.edu).\nPublished Online: April 13, 2020. doi:10.1001/jama.2020.6236\nConflict of Interest Disclosures: Dr Schrag reported receiving grants from the National Cancer Institute, the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute, and the American Association for Cancer Research; receiving personal fees from Pfizer; and receiving nonfinancial support from Grail.

This has brought unprecedented efforts to institute the practice of physical distancing (called in most cases \u201csocial distancing\u201d) in countries all over the world, resulting in changes in national behavioral patterns and shutdowns of usual day-to-day functioning.\nWhile these steps may be critical to mitigate the spread of this disease, they will undoubtedly have consequences for mental health and well-being in both the short and long term. These consequences are of sufficient importance that immediate efforts focused on prevention and direct intervention are needed to address the impact of the outbreak on individual and population level mental health.\nThe sparse literature on the mental health consequences of epidemics relates more to the sequelae of the disease itself (eg, mothers of children with congenital Zika syndrome) than to social distancing. However, large-scale disasters, whether traumatic (eg, the World Trade Center attacks or mass shootings), natural (eg, hurricanes), or environmental (eg, Deepwater Horizon oil spill), are almost always accompanied by increases in depression, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), substance use disorder, a broad range of other mental and behavioral disorders, domestic violence, and child abuse.1 For example, 5% of the population affected by Hurricane Ike in 2008 met the criteria for major depressive disorder in the month after the hurricane; 1 out of 10 adults in New York City showed signs of the disorder in the month following the 9/11 attacks.2,3 And almost 25% of New Yorkers reported increased alcohol use after the attacks.4 Communities affected by the Deepwater Horizon oil spill showed signs of clinically significant depression and anxiety.5 The SARS epidemic was also associated with increases in PTSD, stress, and psychological distress in patients and clinicians.6 For such events, the impact on mental health can occur in the immediate aftermath and then persist over long time periods.\nIn the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, it appears likely that there will be substantial increases in anxiety and depression, substance use, loneliness, and domestic violence; and with schools closed, there is a very real possibility of an epidemic of child abuse. This concern is so significant that the UK has issued psychological first aid guidance from Mental Health UK.7 While the literature is not clear about the science of population level prevention, it leads us to conclude that 3 steps, taken now, can help us proactively prepare for the inevitable increase in mental health conditions and associated sequelae that are the consequences of this pandemic.\nFirst, it is necessary to plan for the inevitability of loneliness and its sequelae as populations physically and socially isolate and to develop ways to intervene. The use of digital technologies can bridge social distance, even while physical distancing measures are in place.8 Normal structures where people congregate, whether places of worship, or gyms, and yoga studios, can conduct online activities on a schedule similar to what was in place prior to social distancing. Some workplaces are creating virtual workspace where people can work and connect over video connections, so they are not virtually alone. Employers should ensure that each employee receives daily outreach during the work week, through a supervisor or buddy system, just to maintain social contact.\nMany observers note that outreach that involves voice and/or video is superior to email and text messaging. Extra efforts should be made to ensure connections with people who are typically marginalized and isolated, including the elderly, undocumented immigrants, homeless persons and those with mental illness. Social media can also be used to encourage groups to connect and direct individuals to trusted resources for mental health support. These platforms can also enhance check-in functions to provide regular contact with individuals as well as to allow people to share with others information about their well-being and resource needs. Even with all of these measures, there will still be segments of the population that are lonely and isolated. This suggests the need for remote approaches for outreach and screening for loneliness and associated mental health conditions so that social support can be provided.\nParticularly relevant here is the developing and implementing routines, particularly for children who are out of school, ensuring that they have access to regular programmed work. Online substitutes for daily routines, as mentioned above, can be extremely helpful, but not all children have access to technologies that enable remote connectivity. Needed are approaches for ensuring structure, continuity of learning, and socialization to mitigate the effect of short- and long-term sheltering in place.\nSecond, it is critical that we have in place mechanisms for surveillance, reporting, and intervention, particularly, when it comes to domestic violence and child abuse. Individuals at risk for abuse may have limited opportunities to report or seek help when shelter-in-place requirements demand prolonged cohabitation at home and limit travel outside of the home. Systems will need to balance the need for social distancing with the availability of safe places to be for people who are at risk, and social services systems will need to be creative in their approaches to following up on reports of problems.\nThird, it is time to bolster our mental health system in preparation for the inevitable challenges precipitated by the COVID-19 pandemic. Stepped care, the practice of delivering the most effective, least resource-heavy treatment to patients in need, and then stepping up to more resource-heavy treatment based on patients\u2019 needs, is a useful approach.9 This will require that systems are both well designed and well prepared to deliver this care to patients, from screening to the overflow of mental illness that will inevitably emerge from this pandemic. Scaling up treatment in the midst of crisis will take creative thinking. Communities and organizations could consider training nontraditional groups to provide psychological first aid, helping teach the lay public to check in with one another and provide support. Even small signs that someone cares could make a difference in the early stages of social isolation. Telemedicine mental health visits, group visits, and delivery of care via technology platforms will be important components of stepped care for both acute crisis management and more routine communication and support. Medicare has already expanded coverage of tele\u2013mental health services to include mental health counseling and virtual visits with psychologists and social workers.10 And health systems, both public and private sector, will need to develop mechanisms for refill and delivery of essential medicines, including psychiatric medicines.\nThis difficult moment in time nonetheless offers the opportunity to advance our understanding of how to provide prevention-focused, population-level, and indeed national-level psychological first aid and mental health care, and to emerge from this pandemic with new ways of doing so. The worldwide COVID-19 pandemic, and efforts to contain it, represent a unique threat, and we must recognize the pandemic that will quickly follow it\u2014that of mental and behavioral illness\u2014and implement the steps needed to mitigate it.\nBack to top\nArticle Information\nCorresponding Author: Sandro Galea, MD, Office of the Dean, Boston University School of Public Health, 715 Albany St, Talbot 301, Boston, MA 02118 (sgalea@bu.edu).\nPublished Online: April 10, 2020. doi:10.1001/jamainternmed.2020.1562\nConflict of Interest Disclosures: None reported.\nReferences\n1.\nNeria  Y\ufeff , Nandi  A\ufeff , Galea  S\ufeff .

As of February 27, 2020, more than 82\u202f000 cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) (the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2) and 2800 deaths have been reported, of which approximately 95% of cases and 97% of deaths are in China.1 Cases have now been reported in 49 other countries. A particularly large outbreak occurred among the passengers and crew of the Diamond Princess cruise ship, where more than 700 infections are reported.\nThe data surrounding the biology, epidemiology, and clinical characteristics of the SARS-CoV-2 virus have been growing daily, with more than 400 articles listed in PubMed. The virus genome was rapidly sequenced, which allowed the development of diagnostic tests and for research into vaccine and therapeutics to start. Meanwhile, the clinical spectrum of disease continues to be defined (including the potential for asymptomatic spread) and clinical trials evaluating treatments have begun. This Viewpoint updates previous guidance for clinicians2 and summarizes what is known, what is unknown, and what are the next steps based on available evidence to address and halt the outbreak.\nThe Virus\nNamed 2019-nCoV by the WHO and SARS-CoV-2 by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses, this virus is a new human-infecting Betacoronavirus that, based on its genetic proximity to 2 bat-derived SARS-like coronaviruses, likely originated in chrysanthemum bats. The virus uses a densely glycosylated spike (S) protein to enter host cells and binds with high affinity to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor in humans in a manner similar to SARS-CoV. However, monoclonal antibodies against the receptor-binding domain of SARS-CoV do not exhibit much binding to SARS-CoV-2, confirming that this is a new virus. The ACE2 enzyme is expressed in type II alveolar cells, and some unconfirmed data suggest that Asian males have a large number of ACE2-expressing cells in the lung, which may partially explain the male predominance of COVID-19. However, other factors such as a higher prevalence of smoking among men in China may explain the difference in the sex distribution of the disease.\nThere is likely an intermediate host between bats and humans, and preliminary data suggest it is the pangolin (a scaly anteater), an endangered and commonly trafficked mammal in which recombination of the bat and pangolin coronaviruses could have occurred. Many questions remain that have clinical and public health implications, such as how this virus emerged, why it is more easily transmissible than SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV, and what are the best targets for vaccines and therapeutics?\nEpidemiology\nCurrent estimates of the incubation period range from 1 to 14 days with a median of 5 to 6 days, although recent case reports suggest that the incubation period may be as long as 24 days,3 which is longer than the 14 days that WHO and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have been using to inform quarantine policies. A potentially longer incubation period has important implications for quarantine policies and prevention of spread. The virus appears to be transmitted primarily through large droplets, but it has also been found in stool and blood, raising questions about other potential modes of transmission.4 If confirmed that the virus can be spread by stool, then different types of precautions may be necessary. As with other coronaviruses, health care\u2013associated transmission appears to be a major mode of infection, with one study suggesting that 41% of 138 cases were presumed to have been health care acquired.5\nThe reproductive number (R0) (the expected number of secondary cases produced by a single infected person in a susceptible population) for SARS-CoV-2, although still preliminary, is estimated between 2 and 3, suggesting a higher pandemic potential than SARS. Transmission from an asymptomatic carrier appears to be possible,3,4 which, if confirmed in larger studies, will have important implications for screening and isolation. A report of 9 pregnant patients suggests that perinatal transmission is unlikely but larger studies are needed to confirm this finding.6 An unanswered question is how many infections have occurred in and outside of China that have not been counted. Using air travel data, one estimate suggests that approximately two-thirds of COVID-19 cases exported from mainland China have remained undetected.7\nClinical Characteristics\nPublished studies of hospitalized patients, mostly in Wuhan, China, have suggested that the median age is in the 50s, with a slight predominance of men; approximately 25% of patients have a severe course requiring intensive care, and approximately 10% required mechanical ventilation.1,5 However, other studies suggest a more benign course in younger adults and children, especially outside Wuhan.8 In general, the clinical presentation has involved fever in 83% to 98% of patients, dry cough in 76% to 82%, and fatigue or myalgias in 11% to 44%. Other symptoms have been reported, such as headache, sore throat, abdominal pain, and diarrhea. Abnormal laboratory findings have included lymphopenia (70%), prolonged prothrombin time (58%), and elevated lactate dehydrogenase (40%). Chest radiographs are characterized by bilateral patchy infiltrates and chest CT scans demonstrate ground-glass infiltrates.\nThere are few data available on histopathological findings, but one study of a patient who died indicated the presence of hyaline membrane formation, interstitial mononuclear inflammatory infiltrates, and multinucleated giant cells, findings not dissimilar from those in SARS or MERS. Currently, it appears that most patients have a mild illness. However, from a clinical standpoint it is essential to more fully define the spectrum of disease, from asymptomatic to severe, and the risk factors for disease progression and mortality.\nCase-Fatality Rate\nLike the clinical manifestations, the case-fatality rate (CFR) appears to be highly variable. Early reports suggested that it could be as high as 8% to 15% in older adults infected in Hubei Province. The CFR is increased in adults with comorbid conditions who developed severe respiratory symptoms. The CFR outside of Hubei, although based on limited data, is much lower, likely no higher than 1% to 2%, although this will depend on accurate detection of those with mild disease.1\nScreening and Testing\nBoth the WHO and CDC recommend screening based on travel to China (especially Hubei Province) or close contact with a person diagnosed or under investigation for SARS-CoV-2 in the past 14 days with fever and/or respiratory symptoms. However, given the increasing number of cases in other countries such as South Korea, Italy, and Japan, and the recent report of a case in California with no history of travel or known contact with someone who traveled, will likely soon lead to changes in screening recommendations.\nAt present, testing capabilities remain limited. CDC has published primers, probes, and protocols, but there have been issues with the test kits and performance that have prevented scaling up of testing beyond a few public health laboratories. According to data published on the CDC coronavirus site, fewer than 500 tests have been conducted in the US. Developing robust testing capabilities is an unmet need in confronting this outbreak and essential for identification of those with infection and minimal symptoms.\nIf a clinician identifies a potential case (ie, a person under investigation for COVID-19), current recommendations from CDC are that the clinical laboratory the clinician will use for testing should contact the local public health laboratory to coordinate testing. It is recommended that the specimen submitted for reverse transcriptase\u2013polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing be a nasopharyngeal and an oral swab and/or a lower respiratory tract sample such as expectorated sputum, tracheal aspirate, or bronchoalveolar lavage. Serum is no longer recommended. Viral cultures are not recommended. Additional tests, such as complete blood cell count and routine microbiology, including molecular testing for other respiratory viruses, can be handled using universal precautions in hospital laboratories.\nClinical Care and Treatment\nThe care of the patient with COVID-19 is similar to that of other viral pneumonias, primarily consisting of supportive care and oxygen supplementation when needed. Corticosteroids have not been recommended. Anecdotal evidence suggests that remdesivir, a nucleoside prodrug that is thought to act by inhibiting viral RNA transcription, may be useful and clinical trials are under way. Additionally, lopinavir/ritonavir has also been tried based on efficacy in animal models of MERS-CoV, but this may not be the case in humans with COVID-19. Recently China approved the use of favilavir, an antiviral drug used for influenza, as investigational therapy for COVID-19. In total, more than 100 clinical trials are currently under way to test novel and repurposed compounds against SARS-CoV-2.\nPrevention and Infection Control\nNo vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 is currently available. More than 11 vaccine candidates are in development and a phase 1 study of an mRNA vaccine developed by the NIH is expected to begin in March 2020. Because health care\u2013associated transmission and infection of health care workers is a major problem, the CDC recommends that health care workers use personal protective equipment (PPE) and implement standard, contact, and airborne precautions including the use of eye protection. Health care workers should wear a gown, gloves, and either an N95 respirator plus a face shield or goggles or a powered, air-purifying respirator. There are many challenges in the infection prevention arena including the presence of clinically mild cases or atypical presentations and limited supply of PPE or respiratory isolation rooms at most hospitals.\nThe current outbreak has prompted a debate about the effectiveness of quarantines both in China and other countries. It appears that the strict measures China took may have \u201cbought the world some time\u201d but did not prevent the global dissemination of SARS-CoV-2. On the other hand, quarantines like the one imposed on passengers and crew of the Diamond Princess increased transmission and resulted in hundreds of infections. When executed properly, quarantines can reduce transmission but human rights must be respected, and in an age of global connectivity it may be difficult if not impossible to implement effective quarantine measures.\nThe rapid progress that science and public health have made in confronting the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak is unparalleled, yet there is still a pressing need to accelerate protocols that lead to the discovery and implementation of rapid point-of-care diagnostic testing, effective antiviral therapies, and eventually, a safe and immunogenic vaccine.\nBack to top\nArticle Information\nCorresponding Author: Carlos del Rio, MD, Emory University School of Medicine, 49 Jesse Hill Jr Dr, FOB Room 201, Atlanta, GA 30303 (cdelrio@emory.edu).\nPublished Online: February 28, 2020. doi:10.1001/jama.2020.3072\nCorrection: This article was corrected on March 6, 2020, to correct the paragraph under \u201cScreening and Testing\u201d that outlines the specimens recommended for PCR testing.\nConflict of Interest Disclosures: Dr Del Rio reports receiving grants from NIAID.

During the Ebola outbreak in 2014, adults who endorsed conspiracy beliefs (eg, a cure for Ebola exists but is being withheld) projected that they would be less likely to seek medical care if they thought they had Ebola and reported less support for quarantine policies than adults who did not endorse these beliefs.3\nAs trusted sources of health information, health care professionals have a powerful opportunity to address misinformation about COVID-19. Almost all of US adults (over 90%) reported trusting information about medical topics from doctors and other health care professionals in 2019.4 In contrast, a majority of respondents to a poll conducted on March 13 and 14 of this year reported not trusting information about COVID-19 from President Trump, and about half did not trust information from the news media.5 Although health care professionals have the potential to leverage their positions as trusted sources of health information to address misinformation about COVID-19, they are facing or will likely soon face enormous strain due to treating people with COVID-19. Moreover, information about COVID-19 from public health organizations is evolving and, at times, conflicting. Bearing in mind the extremely limited time and resources of health care professionals as well as the evolving nature of information on COVID-19, below are 3 ways that health care professionals can dispel misinformation surrounding COVID-19.\nFirst, health care professionals should educate people about trusted sources of information surrounding COVID-19. Many health care professionals do not have the time, resources, or training to teach the public about COVID-19. Moreover, facts about COVID-19 will continue to evolve as the pandemic progresses and more research is conducted. Rather than educating people about COVID-19 itself, health care providers can share their trusted sources of information surrounding COVID-19 with the public (eg, from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC], National Institutes of Health, and the Office of the Surgeon General). Awareness of trustworthy sources of health information is a key component of health information literacy. Information can additionally address stigma, which is important given reports of discrimination (eg, racism toward Asian Americans) related to COVID-19. In seeking to educate people about trusted sources of information, health care professionals should acknowledge that facts will change as research advances.\nSecond, health care professionals need to amplify support for public health recommendations and policies when appropriate. State and local governments are leading public health responses to COVID-19 by recommending social distancing and setting public health policies, including by issuing stay-at-home orders and closing nonessential businesses. Although trust in state and local governments is higher than trust in federal governments, approximately one-quarter of US adults still do not trust information about COVID-19 from their state and local governments.5 This group of adults may be slow to follow new recommendations and policies that are not yet strictly or clearly enforced. Similarly, national public health recommendations are rapidly emerging and evolving. For example, the CDC recently updated their recommendations on face masks, recommending the public start wearing cloth face coverings in public settings. Doctors should lend their credibility to local governments and national public health organizations by vocally supporting and role modeling public health recommendations and policies when appropriate. In cases when public health recommendations conflict with health care professionals\u2019 understanding of the evidence surrounding COVID-19, health care professionals might additionally advise people regarding actions they should take. For example, the CDC\u2019s recommendation regarding cloth face coverings has been disputed by President Trump.6 Health care professionals can provide advice regarding whether to wear masks based on their understanding of the virus, the evidence, and their local context.\nThird, health care professionals can focus their efforts to address misinformation on patients with chronic health conditions. Similar to members of the general public, people with chronic health conditions are susceptible to the spread of misinformation. However, misinformation may be more dangerous to this population if the misinformation leads them to deviate from medical advice surrounding their medication or treatments. For example, patients with inflammatory diseases may question whether they should continue to take medications that suppress their immune systems during this time. Patients with cancer may be fearful about their risks of exposure to COVID-19 while accessing chemotherapy. Much is unknown about how COVID-19 interacts with chronic health conditions and their treatments. Similar to other medical circumstances involving uncertainty, it is helpful for health care professionals to engage in candid, honest conversations with patients about what is known vs unknown and to make recommendations based on clinical experience and expertise. When conversations with individual patients are not feasible (eg, because nonessential appointments are being cancelled or postponed), health care professionals might consider mass communications, such as letters shared through patient portals or the mail to address common concerns that patients may have.\nWe need to fight 2 pandemics\u2014that of COVID-19 and that of misinformation. As trusted sources of health information, health care professionals have an opportunity to address misinformation and promote public health during this pandemic. But they need strategies to address misinformation that will not further overburden their time and resources. Educating people about trusted sources of health information, amplifying support for public health policies when appropriate, and focusing efforts on vulnerable patients are key steps that providers can take toward addressing misinformation.\nArticle Information\nCorresponding Author: Valerie A.

During the 2 weeks ending on March 28, nearly 10 million people filed for unemployment insurance, dwarfing any previous monthly numbers. Estimates suggest that the US economy will contract by 10% to 25% during the second quarter. The US has entered a COVID-19 recession.\nHistorically, health care has been relatively immune from recessions. People get sick during both good and bad times, so demand for medical care is relatively constant across the business cycle. Furthermore, health insurance reduces the out-of-pocket costs for care that people face; thus, many sick people\u2014at least those with health insurance\u2014can still afford to visit physicians.\nHowever, the COVID-19 recession is shaping up to be different. For starters, people are being asked to curtail outside activities. This is particularly true for those who have medical conditions that put them at higher risk\u2014the type of individuals who use health care the most. On top of this is the desire to keep medical offices clear to reduce the risk of being a point of disease spread. In addition, the insurance that privately insured patients have today is less generous than it was during past recessions. More than one-quarter of those with private insurance have an insurance policy with a deductible of $2000 or more, 4 times the percentage of people who had a deductible that high one decade ago. With cash tight, people will postpone all kinds of care, from office visits to imaging procedures to filling prescriptions for medications.\nHealth care offices are already feeling the pinch. Although there are no national data, some primary care practices are reporting reductions in use of health care services of up to 70%. Without major cash reserves, the salaries of clinical staff are being frozen or reduced, and some staff are being furloughed. For the week ending on March 21, the second largest source of unemployment insurance claims in Michigan was from health care businesses, trailing only restaurants and bars.\nThe federal government\u2019s response has been 2-pronged: the Federal Reserve is cutting interest rates and flooding the markets with cash. On the fiscal side, Congress enacted the largest relief bill in history. The $2 trillion relief bill provides cash to most US families, loans for small businesses, and $100 billion set aside for hospitals overwhelmed by COVID-19. The federal response was admirably quick and generally well designed. For once, politics moved past dysfunction. The key question is whether it will be enough.\nMind Your V\u2019s and U\u2019s\nRecessions come in 2 types: V-shaped and U-shaped. A V-shaped recession is short, with recovery following rapidly from the downturn. A U-shaped recession has a longer period before recovery. The recession of 2007-2009 was a U-shaped recession. V-shaped recessions are much less memorable.\nBecause the COVID-19 recession was partly self-induced, the tendency is to assume it will be short. This was the rationale behind President Trump\u2019s since-abandoned proposal to reopen the economy in mid-April. But this idea is incorrect. As long as there is significant community spread of COVID-19, people are going to be hesitant to reengage. Suppose restaurants open this week and you are not working late, would you go out for dinner? If there were a professional society meeting in another city 2 weeks from now, would you attend?\nIt is the hesitancy of people to expose themselves to risk that matters, as much as the formal restrictions on movement. Put another way, the economy will not regain its footing until the health crisis is addressed.\nThis is where the failure of the federal government to ensure adequate testing capacity for COVID-19 is having a major economic effect as well as a health effect. Had adequate testing capacity been built up in January and February, when there was a chance to do so, the country would be in a better position to selectively reopen. As it is, the economy will sputter until testing capacity is sufficiently extended.\nHarm of Sustained Shutdowns\nThe longer the U lasts, the greater the economic harm. Businesses can survive a short time without customers, longer with the relief bill passed by Congress. But sustained shutdowns become increasingly more painful. As time passes, the relief checks will be exhausted. And without access to credit, some retail businesses\u2014perhaps including medical offices\u2014will shutter permanently. The situation feeds upon itself: fewer jobs means fewer people getting paid and lower wages when people work, which means fewer dollars to spend, and so on. That is why government action is essential in a recession.\nOne silver lining for medical care is that some of the care people are deferring now will be sought later. For example, postponed primary care visits may be rescheduled for the summer. If so, medical staffs that are on furlough now may be able to catch up on billings later. That is not true for other industries like restaurants and entertainment, which may never recoup services not provided now.\nHowever, there are other dangers a long recession poses to health care workers and institutions. Permanent job loss brings with it a reduction in employer-provided insurance coverage. More people will be uninsured or on Medicaid, where payment rates are lower. And as state and local budgets are stretched thin, governments will likely respond with cuts in Medicaid fees and lower payments from the insurance plans of public sector workers. These changes may stay in force for years.\nThe longer the recession, the more likely additional policy actions will be needed. The $2 trillion relief bill is roughly 10% of annual gross domestic product. Thus, it makes up for perhaps 1 month of the contraction the economy is currently experiencing. If the retrenchment goes much longer, more relief will be needed.\nWill the political process be able to follow up with additional action? The unanimous Senate vote for the relief bill shows an appetite for action, but the political parties have not demonstrated the ability to agree on much of anything during the past few years. On both the health and economic fronts, therefore, the situation is fraught with peril.\nArticle Information\nCorresponding Author: David Cutler, PhD, Department of Economics and Kennedy School of Government, Harvard University, 79 John F.

Given the origins of COVID-19 in China, there were initial concerns regarding medication shortages due to the reliance of the US on overseas manufacturing of active pharmaceutical ingredients.1,2 Although no major disruptions in pharmaceutical access have occurred thus far, the future of the pandemic and its effect on the US drug supply remains far from certain.\nThe pharmaceutical supply chain represents a series of interdependent steps that ultimately produce the products that are used by consumers in the US. From manufacturers, pharmaceuticals are shipped through wholesalers or distributors and on to retail, specialty, and mail-order pharmacies as well as to hospitals, nursing homes, prisons, clinics, and other sites of care. Retail pharmacies have an especially important role in this process, dispensing more than 85% of all prescription medications in the US.3 From manufacturers to end users, the pharmaceutical supply chain is vast, employing tens of thousands of workers who manage the annual distribution of an estimated nearly 6 billion prescriptions in the US.3\nAlthough early reports regarding drug shortages have focused on overseas manufacturing, the effect of the COVID pandemic on the distribution of medicines within the US is also a concern. There have been reports that some pharmacies have closed due to the pandemic, and widespread illness, quarantines, and social distancing measures may increasingly disrupt pharmacy access. In addition, given a surge in demand for certain types of health care, there will be heightened need for many medicines such as those used to treat respiratory disease and critical illness.4 There may also be demand surges for specific medicines based on media coverage, emerging evidence of benefit, or other factors. These events, such as those that have already occurred for acetaminophen and hydroxychloroquine, may contribute to \u201cstock outs\u201d at distributors and pharmacies and, if left unregulated, worsened access for many in need.5,6 Federal and state regulators, as well as distributors and pharmacies, should take several emergency response and preparedness measures to address these possibilities.\nDevelop an Essential Medicines Strategy\nFederal and state preparedness efforts should focus on what the World Health Organization (WHO) considers \u201cessential medicines,\u201d which are medicines that satisfy the priority health needs of the population and should be available in the health system at all times, in adequate amounts, with quality ensured, and at a price the individual and community can afford.7 Such treatments include antibiotics, antivirals, antidiabetic agents, cardiovascular drugs, respiratory agents, contraceptives, mental health products, and analgesics. To implement an essential medicines strategy, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) should first develop a list of essential medicines. Such a list is critical in shaping regulations that ensure access to essential medicines is not interrupted during this and future crises.\nPrevent Stockpiling and Drug Shortages\nEfforts are needed to guard against surges in medication use as well as stockpiling that may cause shortages and inequitable access. One major wholesaler recently announced steps to protect its inventory, including to identify and mitigate the risk of drug shortages by allocating specific products, including antibiotics, antiviral agents, and respiratory medicines.8 This allocation strategy should include other essential medicines and be required for all wholesalers. Restricting the retail dispensing of essential medicines to a 30-day emergency supply, including for cash-paying customers, would also reduce the likelihood of demand surges and drug shortages.\nExpand Capacity for Mail-order and Home Delivery\nRapid increases in the capacity for mail-order and home delivery are vital. Many retail pharmacies do not offer home-delivery services, and mail-order pharmacies account for less than 10% of all retail prescriptions dispensed in the US.3 The scope of these delivery systems should be increased given potential for quarantines or widespread pharmacy closures. Following the lead of several large pharmacy chains,9 public and private payers should also provide incentives for pharmacies, particularly independent stores located in underserved areas, to offer home delivery services at no cost.\nFinance an Emergency Supply of Essential Medicines\nGiven the uncertainty around where and when disruptions to the supply chain may take place, health care insurers are also relaxing refill criteria, so as to allow for individuals to stockpile additional medicines. For example, some insurers have announced policies that waive typical refill \u201cwindows,\u201d thereby allowing for early refills for individuals to ensure a sufficient stockpile at home in the event of abrupt disruptions in medication access.9 These measures are necessary but may not be sufficient for the millions of US residents already burdened by their out-of-pocket prescription costs; payors should also consider waiving co-payments, particularly for low-income individuals, so as to allow them to stockpile emergency supplies of essential medicines.\nImplement a Long-term Strategy to Safeguard Access\nWhile the nation and world are rightly focused on the COVID-19 pandemic, this is not the first time that national emergencies have threatened medication access in the US, nor will it be the last. To foster emergency preparedness, federal and state public health agencies should establish and maintain central inventories of essential medicines that can be distributed at state or local levels based on need. The security of such national stockpiles would be further enhanced by increasing domestic production of these medicines so as to protect the supply chain and product availability from unpredictable global events, such as other countries\u2019 decisions to cease importing specific products into the US.4\nEven if these steps were undertaken, there is no guarantee that new challenges would not arise. For example, what if a product such as tocilizumab, which is in clinical trials as a treatment to manage the cytokine storm associated with fulminant viral pneumonia, proves efficacious as a treatment for patients with COVID-19 and severe respiratory compromise? Is the supply chain prepared for this? Are price controls in place to protect the public and ensure that patients have access to this \u201cessential medicine\u201d? Who will pay for the soaring demand for such a treatment?\nFor many individuals in the US, barriers to accessing medicines are nothing new. Economic, clinical, social, and structural factors cause many individuals to go without essential medicines every day. However, the COVID-19 pandemic poses urgent and in some cases, novel challenges, and does so on an order of magnitude greater than ever before. Fortunately, rapid mobilization and transformation of the pharmaceutical manufacturing and distribution system is possible, and many who are involved with and affect the supply chain, ranging from regulators to distributors to pharmacies, have already demonstrated a commitment to meet challenges that arise. Despite this, there is more work to do, and not a moment to lose.\nBack to top\nArticle Information\nCorresponding Author: G.

Physicians, other clinicians, and leaders of health care institutions have been thrust into previously unfathomable situations in which the urgent needs of patients are deferred, clinicians are at risk of acute disease and even death, and non\u2013COVID-19\u2013related clinical operations are reduced substantially. Still, amid the scrambling to adjust to a new reality, the idiom \u201cnecessity is the mother of invention\u201d rings true. We see this in newly (and quickly) developed strategies for distance or virtual learning, mask production, and the new concept of social distancing. It is our belief that many of the changes and breakthroughs that have been made under duress during the COVID-19 pandemic will persist long after the outbreak has waned, thereby resulting in positive long-term change in many aspects of the practice of medicine. We must also remember that the current COVID-19 crisis is unlikely to be the last infectious disease epidemic or pandemic. Therefore, our ability to have systems in place that allow both in-crisis and non-crisis modes of functionality is critical.\nPerhaps the most obvious new opportunity relates to the use of telehealth. For quite some time, various institutions and systems have discussed bringing video visits to the forefront, but it never came to pass because of regulatory and privacy concerns, bureaucracy, disagreements about implementation, and security concerns. Yet, in a matter of weeks, many US institutions are now conducting video visits with the blessing of the US Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services.1 We can be certain that most current problems with some telehealth platforms, whether related to software, hardware, or bandwidth, will only improve in the coming months. It is not difficult to imagine a very near future in which a clinic day will consist of a mixture of video and in-person encounters. Discussions involving laboratory tests, imaging results, or preoperative counseling could be entirely addressed by video visits. Only those patients for whom care is particularly dependent on a physical examination, endoscopy, or other procedure would need to physically visit the clinic. We can easily envision patients queued in a virtual waiting room in the comfort of their home while other patients are in the actual waiting room as the clinician moves from the examination room to video visits and back. This has the added benefit of partially decanting outpatient clinics while still maintaining patient access and volume. Furthermore, the potential benefits of post\u2013COVID-19 changes extend to care of the voice and facial plastic surgery. In both, telehealth platforms allow for routine follow-up, voice therapy, or wound assessment as we work to limit exposure during future outbreaks.\nWe surmise that each subspecialty within otolaryngology will be affected in unique ways. In the case of head and neck oncology, for example, clinicians have been forced to prioritize urgent cancer cases like never before. While an order of priority has been formalized in Canada,2 there is a need for the same in the US with guidelines during in-crisis periods to help prioritize which patients should proceed to surgery. This may also force us to change our approach to more indolent diseases, such as well-differentiated thyroid cancer or asymptomatic hyperparathyroidism. In addition, many surveillance and survivorship visits may require only video-based interaction. Reducing the significant travel burden that is currently borne by many patients who live in rural areas might have the benefit of reducing loss to follow-up.\nGroup visits, which have been shown to be effective in providing care while also providing support, may find new life. What if we could run group visits for head and neck cancer survivorship that matched people at the same trajectory in their stage of recovery and disease? These visits could save time by addressing the shared concerns of people at different trajectories of their illness and allowing survivors to share personal insights that otherwise would be lost. For patients with new diagnoses of low-stage thyroid cancer, patients could have their questions answered about choosing between monitoring or having hemithyroidectomy or total thyroidectomy. Additional data suggest that the first 2 years of active monitoring are the highest stress for patients opting for this approach, and supportive visits might mitigate this burden.3\nPhysicians treating rhinologic disease may face a mandate to minimize aerosol generation. The practice of routine nasal endoscopy during initial encounters may undergo a paradigm shift such that new patients are screened noninvasively. Remote encounters would be supported by a thoughtful history and other noninvasive data in the assessment of rhinologic disease. When an in-person encounter is required, limited examination with anterior rhinoscopy may provide adequate objective information. Narrowing the indications for nasal endoscopy would contribute to resource stewardship and personal safety for the patient and clinician. In cases in which endoscopy is deemed necessary, the grouping of multiple patients into a designated procedure day should be considered, a practice that has long been the norm for other specialties, such as gastroenterology.4 The widespread application of endoscopic sinus surgery for the treatment of rhinosinusitis, including the use of balloon sinuplasty, may be refocused on patients with higher acuity for which intervention is likely to be most effective (eg, allergic fungal sinusitis). Depending on disease severity, treatment strategies may skew more toward immunologic evaluation, newer or more aggressive medical management, implants, and biologic therapy.\nSimilarly, in children, the restrictive triage necessitated by COVID-19 provides a chance to study, or at least reconsider, our approaches to common otolaryngologic diseases with favorable natural history. There may be sustained decreases in use of surgery for diseases in which social distancing may reduce incidence and for which the number needed to treat (ie, number of patients who must receive the intervention for a specific period for 1 patient to benefit) is already high (eg, tonsillectomy for recurrent tonsillitis). Furthermore, recent heightened focus on quality-of-life outcomes for many common elective pediatric otolaryngology procedures reinforces the concept of shared decision-making with families.5 Repercussions of the current pandemic may include diminishing the role of patient and caregiver input in terms of symptoms, behavioral problems, and other concerns when determining surgical candidacy. Additionally, our surgical care model that has focused on the family unit, rather than simply on the child, will need to be monitored as we adjust to new concerns about contagion.\nThe field of otology faces a similar reckoning. A high-speed otologic drill causes frank aerosolizing of bone and respiratory mucosa.6 What precautions are necessary preoperatively and intraoperatively? The challenge of using a powered air-purifying respirator under microscope has been voiced and pushes our field to consider new technologies and tools (eg, a 3-dimensional video exoscope) to keep both the surgeon and the operating field safe. For patients who require binocular microscopy or audiometry, telemedicine paired with commercially available otologic endoscopes may soon allow us to monitor patients with chronic ear disease while pairing with smartphone apps to evaluate changes in hearing. In addition, telemedicine will permit check-ins for patients with chronic dizziness and enable patients with hearing loss in resource-limited areas to receive cochlear implants in urban centers with remote activation and rehabilitation.\nOne subpopulation that is difficult to access with telehealth are those without internet access. This is not an insignificant number of people. In 2019, an estimated 10% of the US population did not have smartphone or internet access.7 While this number continues to decline, these patients tend to be of lower socioeconomic status, older, in more rural locales, and generally underserved. Methods to remotely connect exist and continue to evolve. At a minimum, most of these people have telephone access and therefore can verbally communicate symptoms about health status for triage purposes. Other successful approaches have been developed for those who cannot communicate or if some degree of physical examination is needed. One example is store-and-forward telemedicine, which has been shown within the Alaska Native Health System to improve access for care and reduce wait times as well as decrease travel-associated costs for patients.8 In this approach, patients visit a local clinician (eg, physician, nurse, other health care professional) who has been trained in the protocol and provided equipment to collect health data, including case history, and if indicated, audiometry, tympanometry, and photography of lesions, that are electronically sent to the tertiary care center for review.9 While this approach has been successful, further innovations are needed to reach this underserved population and to close the telemedicine access gap.\nLastly, we may find that our surgical techniques will evolve and be modified in a permanent fashion to decrease the risk of aerosols and subsequent virus exposure. Several reports published in the journal describe the use of such methods to limit exposure. These include limiting involved operating room personnel to small, consistent groups and repurposing commonly available equipment to limit exposure. For example, Pollaers et al10 describe the use of a polymethyl methacrylate [Perspex, Perspex International] box with 3 open sides covered with a transparent drape, under which all maneuvers and instrument passing are performed during operative laryngoscopy. In another report by Bertroche et al,11 a clear plastic drape was laid on the patient while a suction machine was used to evacuate air under the drape during tracheostomy. In this way, tracheostomy can be performed as surgeons place their hands through holes cut into the drape, which effectively separates the surgeons from the airway as it is exposed during the procedure. As mentioned previously, mastoidectomy also results in dust and debris that has the potential to transmit virus particles. Similar to the approaches described by Pollaers et al10 and Bertroche et al,11 Carron et al12 describe the use of a clear plastic barrier during mastoidectomy that is linked to the operative microscope and keeps the operative team separated from aerosolized products during the procedure. We anticipate that innovation in these areas will continue and new protocols will be implemented to allow clinicians to provide care while maintaining safety of those on the front line.\nWhile we cannot predict every aspect of this anticipated transformation, it is incumbent on us to embrace the possibilities that have suddenly become available. Otolaryngologists, and physicians in general, must seize the opportunity to develop a new steady state in which we are well equipped with experience and can adapt to the next in-crisis period with minimal disruption.\nBack to top\nArticle Information\nCorresponding Author: Samir S.

The pandemic has affected people of all nations, continents, races, and socioeconomic groups. The responses required, such as quarantining of entire communities, closing of schools, social isolation, and shelter-in-place orders, have abruptly changed daily life.\nHealth care professionals of all types are caring for patients with this disease. The rapid spread of COVID-19 and the severity of symptoms it can cause in a segment of infected individuals has acutely taxed the limits of health care systems. Although the potential shortage of ventilators and intensive care unit (ICU) beds necessary to care for the surge of critically ill patients has been well described, additional supplies and beds will not be helpful unless there is an adequate workforce.1,2\nMaintaining an adequate health care workforce in this crisis requires not only an adequate number of physicians, nurses, advanced practice clinicians, pharmacists, respiratory therapists, and other clinicians, but also maximizing the ability of each clinician to care for a high volume of patients. Given that surges in critically ill patients could last weeks to months, it is also essential that health care professionals be able to perform to their full potential over an extended time interval. At the same time they cope with the societal shifts and emotional stressors faced by all people, health care professionals face greater risk of exposure, extreme workloads, moral dilemmas, and a rapidly evolving practice environment that differs greatly from what they are familiar with.2-5\nThis Viewpoint summarizes key considerations for supporting the health care workforce so health care professionals are equipped to provide care for their patients and communities. Few of these considerations and suggestions have substantial evidence to support them; they are based on experience, direct requests from health care professionals, and common sense.\nSources of Anxiety Among Health Care Professionals\nBefore effective approaches to support health care professionals can be developed, it is critical to understand their specific sources of anxiety and fear. Focusing on addressing those concerns, rather than teaching generic approaches to stress reduction or resilience, should be the primary focus of support efforts.\nThe best way to understand what health care professionals are most concerned about is to ask. Eight listening sessions with groups of physicians, nurses, advanced practice clinicians, residents, and fellows (involving a total of 69 individuals) held during the first week of the COVID-19 pandemic explored 3 key concerns: what health care professionals were most concerned about, what messaging and behaviors they needed from their leaders, and what other tangible sources of support they believed would be most helpful to them. These discussions consistently centered on 8 sources of anxiety: (1) access to appropriate personal protective equipment, (2) being exposed to COVID-19 at work and taking the infection home to their family, (3) not having rapid access to testing if they develop COVID-19 symptoms and concomitant fear of propagating infection at work, (4) uncertainty that their organization will support/take care of their personal and family needs if they develop infection, (5) access to childcare during increased work hours and school closures, (6) support for other personal and family needs as work hours and demands increase (food, hydration, lodging, transportation), (7) being able to provide competent medical care if deployed to a new area (eg, non-ICU nurses having to function as ICU nurses), and (8) lack of access to up-to-date information and communication.\nAlthough these sources of anxiety may not affect everyone, they can weaken the confidence of health care professionals in themselves and the health care delivery system precisely when their ability to stay calm and reassure the public is most needed. Recognizing the sources of anxiety allows health care leaders and organizations to develop targeted approaches to address these concerns and provide specific support to their health care workforce. The 8 concerns can be organized into 5 requests from health care professionals to their organization: hear me, protect me, prepare me, support me, and care for me. The principal desire of each request, how the 8 sources of anxiety relate to each dimension, and how organizations can respond to them are summarized in the Table.\nTable.  Requests From Health Care Professionals to Their Organization During the Coronavirus Disease 2019 Pandemic\nView LargeDownload\nHealth care professionals want unambiguous assurance that their organization will support them and their family. This includes the organization listening to their concerns, doing all that is possible to protect them and prevent them from acquiring COVID-19 infection, and assuring them that if they do become infected, the organization will support them and their family on all fronts, both medically and socially.\nMessages and Actions Health Care Professionals Desire From Their Leaders\nIn addition to tangible actions to address their concerns, health care professionals desire visible leadership during this turbulent time. Leaders, such as hospital executives, nursing leaders, department chairs, and division chiefs, may need to consider innovative ways to be present and connect with their teams given the constraints of social distancing. It is critical that leaders understand the sources of concern, assure health care professionals that their concerns are recognized, and work to develop approaches that mitigate concerns to the extent that they are able.\nHealth care professionals indicate they appreciate leaders visiting hospital units that are caring for patients with COVID-19 regularly to provide reassurance. They do not expect leaders to have all the answers, but need to know that capable people are deployed and working to rapidly address the issues. Leaders should ask team members \u201cWhat do you need?\u201d and make every effort to address those needs. Health care professionals do not expect the leader to be able to provide everything asked for, but having them ask, listen, and acknowledge requests is appreciated. Health care professionals also want to have confidence that their voice and expertise are a part of the conversation as organizations develop their emergency preparedness plans to respond to the pandemic.\nHealth care professionals are often self-reliant and many do not ask for help. This trait may not serve them well in a time of burgeoning workload, redeployment outside of a clinician\u2019s area of clinical expertise, and dealing with a disease they have not previously encountered. Leaders must encourage team members to ask for help when they need it and emphasize that health care professionals and leaders need to rely on each other. Leaders should ensure that no one feels they must make difficult decisions alone. Health care professionals should also feel empowered to defer less important and time-sensitive activities.\nThe importance of simple and genuine expressions of gratitude for the commitment of health care professionals and their willingness to put themselves in harm\u2019s way for patients and colleagues cannot be overstated. A final overarching request of health care workers\u2014even if only implicitly recognized\u2014is \u201chonor me.\u201d The genuine expression of gratitude is powerful. It honors and thereby could serve to reinforce the compassion of health care workers who risk their lives to help patients infected with this deadly disease. Reinforcing health care professional compassion helps them overcome empathetic distress and fear to provide care under extraordinarily difficult clinical circumstances every day.6 Organizations need not and should not outsource gratitude entirely to the public. This process starts with leadership. Yet, gratitude from leaders rings hollow if not coupled with efforts to hear, protect, prepare, support, and care for health care professionals in this challenging time.\nBack to top\nArticle Information\nCorresponding Author: Tait Shanafelt, MD, Stanford Medicine, Stanford School of Medicine, 500 Pasteur Dr, Stanford, CA 94305 (tshana@stanford.edu).\nPublished Online: April 7, 2020. doi:10.1001/jama.2020.5893\nConflict of Interest Disclosures: Dr Shanafelt reported being the co-inventor of Well-being Index instruments and the Participatory Management Leadership Index and receiving a portion of any royalties paid to Mayo Clinic, the copyright owner, for their use and receiving honoraria for giving presentations and advising health care organizations on the well-being of health care professionals.

He\u2019s the principal investigator of a just-launched convalescent plasma trial at Stony Brook Hospital in New York with a planned enrollment of up to 500 hospitalized patients with COVID-19, a third of whom probably will be intubated. \u201cWe are at lightning speed ramping up production and processes for collecting convalescent plasma,\u201d Bennett-Guerrero explained.\nThe first published report of convalescent plasma against COVID-19, a preliminary communication in JAMA about 5 seriously ill patients in China, was posted online March 27. Two more reports from Wuhan, one published April 6 and the other published April 15, described infusing convalescent plasma into a total of 16 patients seriously ill with COVID-19. All 3 articles said the therapy appeared to save lives; the authors called for randomized controlled trials to confirm their findings.\nUncontrolled\nWithout randomized controlled trials, researchers can\u2019t be sure whether patients recovered because of an experimental therapy or in spite of it. Yet virtually everything that\u2019s known about the use of convalescent plasma against infectious diseases comes from studies in which every patient received the treatment.\n\u201cWe do not know if this is safe and effective,\u201d Bennett-Guerrero acknowledged in an interview. \u201cWe hope it is, because we desperately want to help our patients.\u201d\nHis study does include a control group, but 80% of participants will receive the active treatment\u2014a higher proportion than in most randomized controlled trials.\n\u201cWe think that we\u2019re doing the responsible thing by trying to maximize the number of people who may potentially benefit,\u201d Bennett-Guerrero said. The remaining participants will receive plasma donated by people who had not been infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and, therefore, lack antibodies against it.\nPulmonologist A. Whitney Brown, MD, of the Inova Advanced Lung Disease and Transplant Program at Inova Fairfax Hospital in Virginia, and her coprincipal investigator, Grace Banez-Sese, MD, director of Inova Blood Donor Services, thought long and hard about whether to include a control group in their just-launched convalescent plasma trial in seriously ill patients.\n\u201cI think that\u2019s something everybody is struggling with,\u201d Brown said in an interview. \u201cThat\u2019s been our problem historically with convalescent plasma. You use convalescent plasma when you have no treatment, when you have no vaccine. You just want to help as many people as you can and not hold back.\u201d\nShe and Banez-Sese hope to enroll 200 or more patients into their study. They considered including a control group that would receive plasma without SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, as Stony Brook is doing, Brown said. \u201cThe ethical concern is we think COVID-19 may cause increased clotting.\u201d Plasma is rich in clotting factors and typically used to reverse bleeding problems, Brown noted, so it theoretically could increase clotting risk in patients with COVID-19 without any promise of benefit. (Bennett-Guerrero noted that in some conditions, plasma promotes anticoagulation.)\nStill, she added, \u201cI would love a control group. I would love to rigorously prove\u201d that convalescent plasma works. But instead of a control group, Brown said, she and Banez-Sese will compare trial participants to published case reports of patients with COVID-19 who weren\u2019t treated with convalescent plasma.\nDue to the dearth of randomized controlled trials, \u201cthere are no data that I\u2019m aware of that clearly demonstrate the value of [convalescent plasma] for an infectious disease,\u201d said H. Clifford Lane, MD, clinical director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID).\nIn 2019, Lane coauthored one of the few published randomized trials of convalescent plasma. He and his collaborators randomized 140 children and adults with influenza to either convalescent plasma with high levels of anti-influenza antibodies or to standard plasma. The double-blind study concluded that the anti-influenza convalescent plasma conferred no significant benefit over standard plasma.\nThe NIAID will not pursue a similar trial involving patients with COVID-19, Lane said.\n\u201cI\u2019m a little bit more on the physician-do-no-harm end of the spectrum,\u201d he said. \u201cMany of the things that are so promising in theory fall apart when really studied rigorously.\u201d\nBut, Lane said, he understands why the treatment has captured the attention of so many physicians, scientists, and patients and their families.\n\u201cEverything that\u2019s going on right now in terms of trying to find an effective treatment for COVID-19 is driven by fear and this strong desire to do something for patients,\u201d he said.\nSeeking Answers\nThe US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) first announced March 24, with more details April 3 and April 13, that it would facilitate access to convalescent plasma for treating COVID-19 via 3 regulatory pathways. For now, They\u2019re the only avenues for obtaining convalescent plasma, an investigational medical product, to treat patients.\n\u201cAlthough promising, convalescent plasma has not yet been shown to be effective in COVID-19,\u201d the FDA cautioned. \u201cIt is therefore important to determine through clinical trials, before routinely administering convalescent plasma to patients with COVID-19, that it is safe and effective to do so.\u201d\nOne way to administer convalescent plasma is by conducting a clinical trial, as Bennett-Guerrero and Brown have opted to do, under the traditional investigational new drug (IND) regulatory pathway. Another is expanded access, also called \u201ccompassionate use,\u201d which enables patients with a serious or life-threatening disease to obtain an investigational medical product outside of a clinical trial when there is no alternative treatment available. If such patients can\u2019t obtain convalescent plasma through clinical trials or an expanded-use protocol, their physician can request a single-patient emergency Investigational New Drug Application (eIND). Houston Methodist Hospital reported that on March 28, it became the first US hospital to provide convalescent plasma to a patient with COVID-19, in this case under an eIND.\nThe FDA\u2019s National Expanded Access Treatment Protocol entry criteria are fairly broad: Adults aged 18 years or older with COVID-19 whose disease is severe to life-threatening or deemed by their physician likely to become so are eligible. By April 27, 2115 sites had registered to participate and enrolled 5968 patients, 2576 of whom had received convalescent plasma.\nAs the FDA notes on the expanded access program\u2019s website, though, \u201cthe focus of an EAP is to provide treatment whereas a clinical trial is focused on research.\u201d However, the expanded access program is collecting information about treated patients from their physicians, who are asked to complete short forms 4 hours, 7 days, and 30 days after infusion if their patients remain hospitalized that long.\nPractically every day, another medical center announces plans to begin administering convalescent plasma to patients with COVID-19. \u201cThe use in the United States is mushrooming very rapidly,\u201d said Arturo Casadevall, MD, PhD, chair of molecular microbiology and immunology at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.\nA Blast From the Past\nIn the first known trial of convalescent serum, as described in\ufeff JAMA in 1893, German scientists used serum from animals immunized against diphtheria to treat patients with the disease. By 1901, Emil von Behring had won the first Nobel Prize in Medicine or Physiology for his research demonstrating that neutralizing antibodies, or antitoxins, could be transferred from one person or animal to another. (Von Behring carried out his research into treating diphtheria with antibody-rich plasma with Paul Ehrlich, who shared the 1908 Nobel Prize in Medicine or Physiology for his immunology work.)\nOver the next 120 years or so, convalescent plasma was also used against the 1918 pandemic flu, measles, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), 2003\u2019s severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), and Ebola virus disease.\n\u201cFor most people, this was forgotten history,\u201d said Casadevall, a self-described history buff. By late January, he said, he recognized that SARS-CoV-2 \u201cwas going to be bad\u201d and felt compelled to refresh people\u2019s memories about convalescent plasma.\nHe recalled reading of a prep school physician in Pottstown, Pennsylvania, who had suppressed a measles outbreak by infusing students with plasma taken from a classmate who\u2019d recovered from the disease. Casadevall figured that the 85-year-old report would be particularly engaging because it involved children.\nTo raise awareness as quickly as possible, he dashed off a 600-word op-ed piece about the prep school physician\u2019s experiment and how convalescent plasma was worth trying against COVID-19. The article was rejected by a few newspapers before the Wall Street Journal\ufeff published it February 27.\nCasadevall followed up the op-ed column March 13 with a scientific journal article about the use of convalescent sera for containing COVID-19. That article spurred the establishment of the National COVID-19 Convalescent Plasma Project\u2014\u201ca decentralized grass roots effort from academic institutions\u2026to deploy the use of plasma in this emergency.\u201d Casadevall chairs the group.\n\u201cDr Casadevall has inspired the national movement of convalescent plasma,\u201d University of Chicago lung and thoracic surgeon Maria Lucia Madariaga, MD, said April 13 at a press conference announcing the launch of her institution\u2019s 10-patient open-label trial of the investigational treatment.\nCasadevall distributed his op-ed piece to 20 close scientist friends. \u201cWe are a very eclectic group who are very concerned about the direction of science,\u201d he said. \u201cWe converse all the time by email.\u201d Upon reading it, Casadevall said, his friends were eager to test the treatment. Among them was Michael Joyner, MD, an anesthesiologist and physiologist at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, whose main research interests had been exercise physiology and human performance.\n\u201cI immediately asked, \u2018Arturo, what can I do?\u2019\u201d Joyner recalled in an interview.\nLittle more than a month later, Joyner had become the point person for the National Expanded Access Treatment Protocol.\nIt seems only appropriate that he quoted legendary football coach Vince Lombardi in a recent tweet about efforts to deliver convalescent plasma to patients with COVID-19: \u201cPeople who work together will win, whether it be against complex football defenses or the problems of modern society.\u201d\nSupply and Demand\nIndividuals who want to donate convalescent plasma must be able to document that they had COVID-19 with a laboratory test, according to the FDA, which has compiled resources for people who\u2019d like to donate.\nAt the beginning of the US COVID-19 outbreak, many symptomatic individuals were unable to get a confirmatory nose or throat swab polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test, so at first, they were ineligible to donate convalescent plasma.\nHowever, the FDA now accepts a positive blood antibody test as proof of prior infection. \u201cThe people doing the plasma collection are very interested in increasing the pool of donors based on the lookback test,\u201d said Joyner, referring to antibody testing of individuals presumed to have recovered from COVID-19 that was not confirmed when they were sick. Still, some collection organizations, such as Inova Blood Donor Services, require that convalescent plasma donors have had a confirmatory PCR test because of questions about the antibody tests\u2019 accuracy. \u201cThey\u2019re not fully vetted,\u201d Brown said of the tests.\nThe FDA has not yet cleared any SARS-CoV-2 antibody tests for marketing, but it has granted several emergency use authorizations so blood centers can screen prospective convalescent plasma donors who had not had a confirmatory PCR test when they were sick.\nProspective donors must be symptom-free for at least 28 days, or, alternatively, for at least 14 days if they get a negative PCR test for SARS-CoV-2, indicating that they are no longer infectious, according to the FDA. They must also be eligible to donate blood.\nThe American Red Cross is fulfilling orders for convalescent plasma through both the expanded access treatment protocol and eINDs. \u201cWhile the Red Cross first meets the needs of area hospitals, it can also provide convalescent plasma\u2026throughout the country,\u201d spokeswoman Stephanie Rendon said in an email. As of April 20, the Red Cross had collected convalescent plasma from about 110 donors, which translated into nearly 250 units, 120 of which had already been delivered to hospitals treating critically ill COVID-19 patients, Rendon said.\nAs the number of COVID-19 cases continues to rise, many people have taken to social media to plead for convalescent plasma for their seriously ill loved ones. However, blood collection centers generally do not permit donors to designate their blood for a specific patient. Instead, Brown said, she encourages people interested in making a designated donation to pay it forward and donate to replace the convalescent plasma used by their intended recipient.\nThe AABB (formerly the American Association of Blood Banks) and the New York Blood Center and several other community-based blood centers have partnered with Survivor Corps\u2014a grassroots organization of COVID-19 survivors whose mission is to support research into developing a cure and a vaccine\u2014to increase convalescent plasma donations.\nTiming and Dosing\nIn 2016, an international team of researchers published findings from a trial of convalescent plasma involving 84 patients with Ebola virus disease in Africa. The patients were compared with 418 patients who had been treated for Ebola during the previous 5 months at the same hospital. Convalescent plasma was not associated with a significant improvement in survival, the study found.\nThe Ebola trial doesn\u2019t dissuade Christopher Hillyer, MD, president and CEO of the nonprofit New York Blood Center, which is collecting and banking convalescent plasma for use by hospitals throughout the country, and, as of April 22, had shipped 2700 units. \u201cThey were giving it to extremely ill people,\u201d Hillyer explained.\nFor patients with COVID-19, convalescent plasma seems more effective if it\u2019s given earlier in the course of the disease, according to Beth Shaz, MD, New York Blood Center\u2019s chief medical officer. \u201cIt appears to slow progression of disease and keep people out of the ICU. Some are getting extubated shortly after transfusion,\u201d she said on April 15 in an email to Hillyer and other colleagues.\nIn patients critically ill with acute respiratory distress syndrome, though, convalescent plasma doesn\u2019t seem to be as effective, wrote Shaz, who also is president of AABB.\nStanford University researchers will soon begin testing convalescent plasma in emergency department patients with COVID-19 respiratory symptoms who aren\u2019t yet sick enough to be admitted to the hospital. They hope to enroll 206 patients in their double-blinded, randomized controlled trial that will compare convalescent plasma with plasma that does not contain SARS-CoV-2 antibodies.\nJohns Hopkins scientists have launched a triple-blinded randomized controlled trial of convalescent plasma in 150 adults who aren\u2019t even sick. Eligible participants are high-risk based on age and overall health. They must have had close contact with a COVID-19 patient within 96 hours of enrolling in the study. Participants will receive either convalescent plasma or plasma without SARS-CoV-2 antibodies within 120 hours of having close contact with a COVID-19 patient.\nPlasma with higher titers of anti-COVID-19 neutralizing antibodies is thought to be most effective, but many patients are receiving plasma with unknown titer levels. The FDA advises that if collection centers don\u2019t measure antibody titers before convalescent plasma is infused, they should save a bit of the donor\u2019s blood for future testing to see if higher titers do indeed correlate with better outcomes.\nMany patients are receiving a 1-time dose of 1 unit of plasma, but some institutions think 2 units, administered 24 hours apart, helps address the variability in donors\u2019 antibody titers, Shaz said.\nNext Steps\nConvalescent plasma is like a bridge. It\u2019s thought to help defend patients against SARS-CoV-2 until their own immune systems get up to speed. And in the minds of some scientists, it\u2019s a stopgap measure until more refined treatments and a vaccine can be mass-produced.\nOne of those treatments is intravenous (IV) immunoglobulin, made of pooled IgG from convalescent plasma. The NIAID has been working to develop and launch a placebo-controlled trial of IV IgG to treat COVID-19, Lane said. Unlike convalescent plasma, IV IgG can be standardized and used to treat anyone, no matter their blood type.\nChinese scientists in March reported on 3 Wuhan patients with severe COVID-19 who recovered after receiving high-dose IV IgG. They concluded that randomized trials of high-dose IV IgG in deteriorating patients infected with COVID-19 should be considered.\nFurther down the road is the development of monoclonal antibodies targeting SARS-CoV-2. The Gates Foundation, Wellcome, and Mastercard have launched a COVID-19 Therapeutics Accelerator, which will screen new monoclonal antibodies for possible anti\u2013COVID-19 activity. Those that pass would be developed by an industry partner.\nPatrick Wilson, PhD, an antibody biology researcher at the University of Chicago, plans to isolate B cells, which produce antibodies, from convalescent plasma donors\u2019 white blood cells. Every B cell produces a unique antibody as part of the immune response. Wilson said his lab will clone antibody genes from COVID-19\u2013induced B cells to try to determine which one accounts for a convalescent plasma donor\u2019s effective immune response against SARS-CoV-2.\nBecause monoclonal antibodies have already been developed to treat cancers, \u201cthe infrastructure\u2019s there,\u201d Wilson said. \u201cWe can grow a lot of antibodies really efficiently.\u201d However, he added, \u201cTesting [monoclonal antibodies] in patients, that would take a while, regrettably.\u201d\nFor now\u2014and possibly the next 18 to 24 months, Bennett-Guerrero said\u2014convalescent plasma, despite supply issues and questions about efficacy and who is most likely to benefit from treatment, remains the only off-the-shelf therapy for COVID-19.\n\u201cAll of these convalescent plasma programs are against the backdrop of a massively dangerous infection,\u201d Hillyer noted. \u201cThis is an imperfect science, but it\u2019s better than dying.\u201d", "jama.2020.5788": "S\nince the first US case of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection as identified in Washington State on January 20, 2020, more than 235\u202f000 cases have been identified across the US in just over 2 months. Given the challenges in expanding testing capacity and the restrictive case definition of persons under investigation, the true number of cases is likely much higher.\nBy March 17, the outbreak had expanded from several isolated clusters in Washington, New York, and California to all 50 states and the District of Columbia. As of April 2, there have been more than 5000 COVID-19\u2013associated deaths in the US. With a global total now of more than 1 million cases, the US is now the country with the largest number of reported cases, comprising about one-fifth of all reported infections.\nWith community transmission firmly established, the US epidemic enters the exponential growth phase in which the number of new cases is proportional to the existing number of cases. This phase continues until either enough susceptible individuals become immune as a result of infection, stringent public health measures are followed, or both.\nCase Fatality\nA yet unanswered question that adds to uncertainty around the outbreak involves the case-fatality rate (CFR), defined as the percentage of deaths among all cases. Presently, global mortality is reported at 4.7% but this varies widely by location from a high of 10.8% in Italy to a low of 0.7% in Germany. Several factors influence the CFR including a reliable estimate of the total number of cases. Among the first 140\u202f904 cases in the US, 1.7% died; however, given the uncertainty in the denominator, this is not a reliable CFR estimate. For example, the crude CFR in Wuhan, China, was reported to be 5.8% on February 1, whereas more methodologically robust estimates using novel methods to estimate the actual number of cases reported the CFR as 1.4%.1\nIn the coming weeks, surge capacity at US hospitals will influence the CFR. However, to have reliable estimates, better approximations of the overall population (denominator) are essential, and methods such as serosurveys using statistical sampling generalizable to the populations of interest will inform these estimates.\nNew Clinical and Epidemiological Insights\nIs PCR Always Positive? What Is the Meaning of a Negative PCR? Several types of tests are being used to identify severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).2 These can be classified into 2 general categories: molecular diagnosis/polymerase chain reaction (PCR)\u2013based testing and serological testing. In clinical settings, PCR-based testing remains the primary method of identifying SARS-CoV-2. Given the lack of a reference standard for diagnosing COVID-19, the sensitivity and specificity of diagnostic testing are unknown. In addition, inadequate sample collection may reduce test sensitivity. In a study of 5 patients, individuals with chest computed tomography findings compatible with COVID-19, and a negative reverse transcriptase (RT)\u2013PCR result for SARS-CoV-2, tested positive on subsequent testing, suggesting that certain patients (eg, with compatible radiological findings) might require repeat testing with specimens collected from multiple sites in the respiratory tract.3\nIt is likely that lower respiratory samples (eg, minibronchial alveolar lavage) are more sensitive than a nasopharyngeal swab. Thus, it is important to emphasize that, depending on the clinical presentation, a negative RT-PCR result does not exclude COVID-19. Multiple serological tests are in various stages of development. With wider availability of serological testing, it will be possible to determine whether patients have a false-negative PCR result.\nCan Patients Become Reinfected? Reports from China and Japan have indicated that some patients with COVID-19 who were discharged from the hospital after a negative RT-PCR result were readmitted and subsequently tested positive on RT-PCR. It is unclear from the available information if these were true reinfections or the tests were falsely negative at the time of initial discharge. However, while other coronaviruses demonstrate evidence of reinfection, this usually does not happen for many months or years. Therefore, it is unlikely that these were true cases of reinfection. Some reassuring evidence comes from a challenge study among rhesus macaques.4 After initial challenge and clearance of SARS-CoV-2, the animals were rechallenged with the virus but were not infected. While the evidence on reinfection is evolving, current data and experience from previous viruses without substantial seasonal mutation do not support this hypothesis.\nHow Long Does Immunity Last? Presently, there is no validated immune correlate of protection for SARS-CoV-2, ie, antibody level or another immunological marker associated with protection from infection or disease. However, in a study that included 82 confirmed and 58 probable cases of COVID-19 from China, the median duration of IgM detection was 5 days (interquartile range, 3-6), while IgG was detected at a median of 14 days (interquartile range, 10-18) after symptom onset.5 Because the outbreak is only a few months old, there are no data on long-term immune response. Data from SARS-CoV-1 indicate that titers of IgG and neutralizing antibodies peaked at 4 months after infection, with a subsequent decline through at least 3 years after infection.\nShould Everyone Wear a Mask in Public? Current guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) do not recommend routine use of medical masks among healthy individuals and suggest limiting mask use to health care workers and those caring for patients with COVID-19. However, this guidance is likely to be modified. Regardless, any change in policy should prioritize the availability of masks for health care workers. Priority should also be given to others with risk of exposure such as first responders and incarcerated individuals. Due to the current scarcity of masks, many in the community have begun sewing masks for themselves and for health care workers. A fitted N95 respirator is the preferred type of medical mask for health care workers; however, supplies in the US are very limited. Medical masks are also recommended for symptomatic individuals to prevent them from transmitting the virus.\nThe rationale supporting the recommendations comes from studies finding limited to no efficacy of masks in protecting healthy individuals from influenza infection and also for the need to preserve supplies. However, evidence from influenza studies might not be relevant for COVID-19. For example, in a systematic review, masks, particularly combined with other measures such as handwashing, were found to be effective in preventing SARS-CoV-1 infection.6 Moreover, with the increasing evidence of presymptomatic transmission of SARS-CoV-2, there might be value in the use of masks among individuals at risk of transmission.7\nHow Does SARS-CoV-2 Spread? Current evidence suggests that SARS-CoV-2 is primarily transmitted through droplets (particles 5-10 \u03bcm in size). Person-to-person transmission occurs when an individual with the infection emits droplets containing virus particles while coughing, sneezing, and talking. These droplets land on the respiratory mucosa or conjunctiva of another person, usually within a distance of 6 ft (1.8 m) but perhaps farther.8 The droplets can also settle on stationary or movable objects and can be transferred to another person when they come in contact with these fomites. Survival of the virus on innate surfaces has been an important topic of discussion. While there are few data, the available evidence suggests that the virus can remain infectious on inanimate surfaces at room temperature for up to 9 days. This time is shorter at temperatures greater than 30\u00b0 C. The good news is that cleaning and disinfection are effective in decreasing contamination of surfaces, emphasizing the importance of high-touch areas.9\nTransmission through aerosols, particles smaller than 5 \u03bcm, can also occur under specific circumstances such as endotracheal intubation, bronchoscopy, suctioning, turning the patient to the prone position, or disconnecting the patient from the ventilator. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation is another important aerosol-generating procedure.\nIn a recent study of environmental sampling of rooms of patients with COVID-19, many commonly used items as well as air samples had evidence of viral contamination.10 In the context of the heterogeneity in evidence and possibility of aerosolization of the virus during certain medical procedures, public health agencies (including the CDC) recommend airborne precautions in situations involving patients with COVID-19.\nWhen Can Social Distancing Measures Be Lifted? With the exponential increase in US COVID-19 cases and deaths, several jurisdictions have implemented social-distancing measures. Modeling and empirical studies suggest that social-distancing measures can help reduce the overall number of infections and help spread out cases over a longer period of time, thus allowing health systems to better manage the surge of additional patients. However, long-term social distancing can have detrimental effects on physical and mental health outcomes as well as the economy.\nA few changes may allow for easing restrictions: First, an aggressive program of testing to identify asymptomatic and mild cases combined with proactive contact tracing and early isolation as well as quarantine of contacts. Second, there must be a focus on reducing home-based transmission. In Wuhan, particularly after the initial phase, most transmissions occurred within households. While the CDC has published guidelines for preventing household transmission, it did not place enough emphasis on the importance of having the infected person always wear a mask. Third, even a treatment that only shortens an intensive care unit stay by 20% to 30% can have a substantial benefit on health system capacity.\nWhen Will a Vaccine Be Available? The ultimate strategy for controlling this pandemic will depend on a safe and efficacious vaccine against SARS-CoV-2. However, only 3 vaccine candidates are currently in phase 1 human trials: a messenger RNA vaccine and 2 adenovirus vector-based vaccines. The estimated timeline for availability of an initial vaccine is between early and mid-2021.\nConclusions\nAs the COVID-19 outbreak expands in the US, overall understanding of this disease has increased, with more information available now than even a few weeks ago. However, more evidence is needed, particularly for public health and clinical interventions to successfully prevent and treat infections. Even during a pandemic, obtaining rigorous, reliable data is not a distraction, rather it is essential for accurately measuring the extent and severity of COVID-19 and assessing the effectiveness of the response.\nBack to top\nArticle Information\nCorresponding Author: Carlos del Rio, MD, Emory University School of Medicine, 49 Jesse Hill Jr Dr SE, FOB Room 201, Atlanta, GA 30303 (cdelrio@emory.edu).\nPublished Online: April 6, 2020. doi:10.1001/jama.2020.5788\nConflict of Interest Disclosures: Dr del Rio reported receiving grants from the National Institutes of Health/National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.

As the US Navy hospital ships are preparing to launch (USNS Comfort and Mercy) and governors are calling for military field hospitals to be used, there are several unanswered questions to be considered, such as who will staff these military installations, who will direct them, and what services will they provide. Many military medical clinicians are currently deployed to Iraq, Afghanistan, and Syria, as well as other areas of the world, and are unlikely to be called back anytime soon. Others will be needed to keep the 54 military treatment facilities (MTFs) open to care for the 9.4 million military beneficiaries and their families. Additionally, as key members of the health care community, military medical personnel will be needed to treat patients with COVID-19 who are seen at MTFs. In 2007, we described the unique partnership developed between the US Department of Defense and several civilian professional surgical societies to assist in the care of combat casualties alongside military medical personnel at the US Army Hospital in Landstuhl, Germany.1 It is now time to consider a similar such program in the US for this and future national emergencies.\nThe 2017 US National Defense Authorization Act called for the establishment of military-civilian partnerships for the purpose of training and sustaining essential trauma knowledge points and skills for a deployment-ready medical force.2 These partnerships will be funded through the recently passed US Pandemic and All Hazards Preparedness and Innovation Act (also known as the Mission Zero Act).3 For the past 5 years, the American College of Surgeons (ACS), in partnership with the US Military Health System, has been working to define the knowledge points and skills for the combat casualty care team as well as develop the criteria for selecting and evaluating military-civilian partnerships formed to provide this training.4 These blue book criteria, although originally designed for trauma, can easily be adapted to military-civilian partnerships formed to respond to mass casualty incidents or to offload civilian hospitals during crises caused by infectious diseases.5 An example of a combined military-civilian disaster response occurred in Haiti in 2010. The USNS Comfort was deployed to Port-au-Prince with US Navy personnel and civilian medical volunteers to care for the injuries resulting from the earthquake. Over a 40-day period, 927 operative procedures were performed on the ship through this collaborative effort.6\nOver the past 2 decades of war, the US Military has provided trauma care to injured troops with the highest recorded survival rates.7 Much of this care is provided by forward-looking medical teams in austere environments, including field hospitals. Thus, it would make sense for military assets to be used in areas of the US hit hardest by the COVID-19, but these military platforms are designed for the care of combat casualties, not infectious disease. On the other hand, a portable military platform that is augmented with civilian medical personnel could offload large civilian trauma centers, freeing up staff, beds, and equipment in those civilian hospitals for the care of patients with COVID-19. The addition of civilian trauma teams to military surgical personnel would also help ensure that MTFs are left with adequate staffing. However, for such a program to be successful, several criteria outlined in the blue book need to be considered.\nInstitutional Commitment\nA formal agreement must exist between the civilian trauma center and the deployed military asset. This agreement would include plans for how military medical personnel would be granted privileges and credentials through the partnering institution as well as coverage for malpractice. These personnel will also need access to the electronic medical record. Federalization of all licenses for the military teams must be granted and there should be an agreement as to how billing for procedures performed at the military asset will be handled.\nGovernance and Administration\nWe suggest that the ideal leadership model of these military platforms be flexible depending on the location. A coleadership model, with military personnel reporting to their leadership and civilian personnel to the trauma director, is proposed. Similarly, the trauma program manager must have a military copartner. Patients treated in the military facility would still be entered into the ACS National Trauma Data Bank and the ACS trauma risk-adjusted quality and safety program.\nHuman Resources\nIn addition to the 2 directors cited previously, other members of the trauma faculty, as well as trauma specialists in other aligned fields (eg, anesthesia, orthopedics, neurosurgery, emergency medicine, critical care, radiology, and vascular surgery) must support this new trauma care facility and be willing to work within the guidelines outlined for treating these patients. Nurses, advanced practice clinicians, and other allied health professionals should also be included in the plans.\nPhysical Resources\nOnce established, the number of patients that can be treated in this temporary trauma facility must be determined. How many operating rooms will be included and how many intensive care unit beds will be available? Other facilities essential to caring for the trauma patient must be close by, such as the blood bank, radiology (radiography, computed tomography scans, and interventional facilities), and laboratory services. Restocking of supplies and surgical equipment should be considered as well. Communication with prehospital personnel is essential so that trauma patients can be delivered to the new temporary emergency facility. There must also be a plan to house and feed military personnel deployed to this location (with the exception of the US Navy ships that are self-contained).\nEducation\nThe civilian trauma teams will need an orientation to the facilities provided by the military (eg, ventilators and resuscitation equipment). Conversely, military medical personnel will have to know the trauma protocols and practice management guidelines of the partnering institution. Should the deployed military teams not be previously trained in trauma, the educational program developed through the ACS partnership with the US Department of Defense (the Military Health System Strategic Partnership, ACS) can be used to address knowledge gaps.\nEvaluation\nA weekly evaluation of the entire program by all involved personnel will be essential to its success. This could be done at the local level or by connecting similar settings nationwide via teleconferencing. These evaluations would include not only trauma patient outcomes, use of resources, lessons learned, and opportunities for improvement but also the success of the partnerships in fulfilling its mission: to enhance the care of patients with COVID-19 by augmenting trauma care.\nThis pandemic can be viewed as a catalyst to the formation of more permanent military-civilian partnerships. While we are currently in unchartered water, one thing that we do know is that the trauma care provided by US military medical teams is among the best in the world and that partnering with them could mitigate the effect of this pandemic by freeing up beds, equipment, and staff while still responding to the major cause of death in the US: trauma.\nBack to top\nArticle Information\nCorresponding Author: M.

Concerns about droplets and virus aerosolization have been raised during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) crisis, particularly after an endoscopic hypophysectomy in Wuhan, China, supposedly led to 14 members of the surgical team becoming infected with the novel coronavirus.1-3 The goal of this case-control study was to devise a drape system to control the droplet spray during mastoidectomy.\nMethods\nThe procedure was carried out on a cadaveric temporal bone in an operating room with a surgeon and a surgical technician. The Zeiss Extaro 300 microscope (Carl Zeiss Meditec AG) was covered with a Zeiss-brand microscope drape. Two different clear drapes were then attached to the lens cap apparatus: the Steri-Drape 1015 (3M) and the C-Armor (Tidi). The Steri-Drape 1015 was attached to the microscope drape using the adhesive along the split and then zipped to itself, with the surgeon putting her arms under the drape. The much larger C-Armor drape was attached by making a 4- to 5-cm incision in the drape and then stretching it tightly around the lens cap cover apparatus of the microscope drape. Because of the large size of the drape, both forearms were inserted through 2 small cuts in the drape to keep a tight fit. Both drapes were then stretched over a Mayo stand at the patient\u2019s head. The clear drape was attached to the surgical drape over the patient chest area using Ioban (3M) to limit aerosol spread toward the anesthetist. Mastoidectomy was then performed in the usual fashion under both drapes, with added methylene blue after the preferred drape was determined to look for gross droplet soiling as well as in a suction scavenger placed near the mastoid. The study was exempt from institutional review board review because it involved single use of deidentified cadaveric tissue.\nResults\nSurgical visualization was unimpeded with both drapes, and the collection of bone dust and droplets did not cause undue sagging of the drapes. While the split-drape adhesive design of the 1015 drape was easier to attach to the microscope, the C-Armor\u2019s larger size gave much better coverage and overlap with the surgical drape (Figure 1). Furthermore, visualization of the instruments for the technician was easier with the C-Armor rather than the matte finish of the Steri-Drape 1015. Although the surgical procedure was accomplished without the drape getting in the way, extensive irrigation and large bone dust and irrigation droplets were collected on the drape and inside the scavenger suction within minutes (Figure 2).\nDiscussion\nThe middle ear cleft is directly connected to the nasopharynx via the eustachian tube and therefore could be considered a possible route of spread for coronavirus or other infections. Furthermore, drilling of the mastoid creates a large cloud of irrigation and bone dust that can easily come in contact with facial skin or be inhaled. While the technique described here is far from airtight, it controls large droplet spray very well using readily available surgical drapes. Other large, clear drapes will probably adapt even better than the 2 tried in this study.\nMastoidectomy is usually an elective procedure and is typically deferred until severe infection is controlled. While rapid COVID-19 screening should ultimately diminish the risk of infecting surgical staff, false negatives will occur, especially in asymptomatic early infections. The risk to the surgeon and staff should be evaluated according to risk stratification protocols, and proper N95 masks and personal protective equipment should be used when indicated. However, it has been our observation that using a microscope with a face shield is virtually impossible, and the method described herein avoids the need for face shields to allow for otherwise normal drilling conditions.\nBack to top\nArticle Information\nAccepted for Publication: April 13, 2020.\nCorresponding Author: Jeffrey D.

After a 12-hour shift at our hospital, The National Cancer Institute of Milan, we decided to turn off the lights, put a candle near the screens of our laptops, and share our feelings with the oncology community.\nWe had come back from Australia and Peru on the previous Saturday morning to the news that the first case had already been discovered in the city of Codogno. We were expecting the first case; we knew that it could happen; we knew it would happen; but we did not know when or where. In the beginning, there was a bit of disbelief and, although the virus was close, it still seemed very far away. It did not help that scientists and politicians were divided into alarmists and nonalarmists. Even we, people of science, could not disentangle ourselves from what was true and what was blown out of proportion. In the second phase, we felt afraid for the elderly, for the most fragile people in the community, but we never thought that the virus would touch all of us so closely. As the time passed we felt more patriotic, and at 6:00 in the evening, when the numbers of the dead were published, people took to their balconies and began singing to life and the national anthem, as they had done in China in the months before. Children hung rainbows out with the words \u201ceverything will be fine.\u201d We have all been afraid; we have been glued to the web for hours in a desperate search for comforting news or falling numbers. We tried doing math: if only they locked everything down, within 10 days we will start to see a decrease in the number of deaths. But no, the numbers went up. Today, we rejoice that there were only 600 deaths instead of 800. We felt outrage toward those who refused to stay at home while we were still working. We felt anger toward those who went out for long rides with the dog, those who jogged, and for those who did not understand that their lack of responsibility was putting our lives and the lives of our families at risk. The first great pain I felt was when a dear friend\u2019s relative became sick in a community for the elderly. The fever went up; the first test results were negative; the fever stayed high; and then the second test results came in positive. And there, in isolation, without ever seeing family or friends again, the person died. The people who die from COVID-19 have no rights\u2014no right to be visited, no right to a hug, no right to a funeral. They die alone.\nThen our colleagues began to get sick. Unfortunately, many of us, physicians, sometimes feel immortal. We often think something can happen to others and not to us, but this time death touches us all. In the evening the city is dark and silent. The only noises you can hear are the ambulance sirens. Now we feel like the patients in these ambulances, mortal and frail.\nNevertheless, we are not overwhelmed by the heaviness of restrictive measures on social distancing: every day, for 5 to 6 days per week, we cannot follow the hashtag #stayhome because we go to work, and we have at least the chance to share thoughts, fears, and\u2014sometimes\u2014anger and disappointment. We meet colleagues and patients and even laugh about funny stories, but it is clear to all of us that the level of stress and the risk of burnout that health care professionals are facing is alarming. In a few days, we had to decide on the risk-benefit ratio of using intensified treatments and combinations, maintenance strategies, and later-line treatments for each individual patient. We set up multidisciplinary teams by video to discuss our experiences and hard-to-make decisions. We had to find the best strategies to communicate our management of care plans to our patients and their families. As physicians of a referral center facing the lockdown of the whole country, we had to decide what to do for some patients with cancer already enrolled in clinical trials, and the patients who faced travel disruptions and the lack of flights from the south of Italy to our hospital in the north, and the fear these patients with cancer had of being infected with COVID-19 while traveling.\nWe were terrified after reading the recent reports on undocumented infections as a crucial source of contagion.1 We were terrified when we thought about models of transmission when applied to our daily lives here at the hospital. Unfortunately, during the past few days, we have been facing the terrific and very real effects of the lack of prevention of intrahospital infections. In the Lombardy region, the epicenter of the outbreak in Italy, and in many other regions in Italy, asymptomatic or paucisymptomatic health care workers who had contact with patients confirmed to have COVID-19 are not routinely tested unless they develop severe symptoms. Individual protection devices are often lacking and cannot be used for intermediate-risk scenarios. Some of our colleagues have tested positive and are now at home or, even worse, hospitalized in intensive care units. Some of us have already infected entire families, children, grandparents.\nAt this moment, we feel unprotected. Although everyone in the newspapers is praising physicians as heroes, we feel alone, thrown into jeopardy, thrown into an abyss. Our region has left us to fight the cancer battle and the COVID-19 war without true protection, without knowing whether we are infected with the virus. We go to work every day because we love our jobs, and this is the life we have chosen. But we are people too; we are afraid of getting infected, of going home in the evening, of infecting our children, our parents. When entering our homes, we take the stairs and not the elevator, afraid of infecting the condominiums and buildings where we live. But above all, we live with the absurdity of trying to cure patients of a disease like cancer at the same time potentially being the vehicles for a virus that might kill these very patients.\nTo stand up and fight for maintaining high standards in cancer care, we have launched a social media campaign called #knowyourstatus to extend periodical and frequent testing for SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2), the virus that causes COVID-19, to health care workers involved in the treatment of patients with cancer. Our aim is to guarantee separate and \u201cclean\u201d pathways for patients with cancer. Even if this objective is failing in front of our very eyes, we will not give up on maintaining the involvement of institutions, patients\u2019 advocacy organizations, and oncologist associations.\nIn this time of fear and anger, the most important thing is sharing. We have found ourselves united across borders. We have felt the love of so many people for us and for our country. How do we survive then? With love for our patients, for our professions, and thanks to the sharing that has been created between us.\nWe do not know if we will ever go back to how we were before this ordeal. We want to thank everyone who has been with us every step of the way, but we will never forget the loneliness we were left in while fighting this war. In a different way but similar to someone who has died of COVID-19.\nBack to top\nArticle Information\nAccepted for Publication: March 25, 2020.\nCorresponding Author: Filippo Pietrantonio, MD; Marina Chiara Garassino, MD, Medical Oncology Department, Fondazione IRCCS Istituto Nazionale dei Tumori, Via Venezian, 1-20133 Milan, Italy (filippo.pietrantonio@istitutotumori.mi.it; marina.garassino@istitutotumori.mi.it)\nPublished Online: April 10, 2020. doi:10.1001/jamaoncol.2020.1426\nConflict of Interest Disclosures: Dr Pietrantonio reported personal fees from Amgen, Roche, Merck-Serono, Bayer, Servier, Sanofi, and Lilly, and grants from BMS outside the submitted work.

Widely considered to be Shakespeare\u2019s most psychologically nuanced tragedy, King Lear tells the story of an elderly king who unfairly divides his kingdom, is betrayed by his heirs, and descends into madness. The play has given me chills many times over, but I never appreciated Lear raving in the storm as I do now in the storm of novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Although Lear spends much of the play wandering on a desolate heath, his confrontation with an unspeakable chaos that dismantles the old order mirrors the existential dread of our moment. As a pediatrics intern training in New York City, I had turned to the play in search of the comfort of a well-worn story. What emerged were new lessons that reflect the different world and perspective we now inhabit.\nWilliam Dyce (1806-1864), King Lear and the Fool in the Storm, circa 1851, Scottish. Oil on canvas. 136 cm\u2009\u00d7\u2009173 cm.\nCollection of the National Galleries of Scotland, Scottish National Gallery. Purchased with assistance of the Art Fund, 1993.\nWhen Lear\u2019s daughter Regan asks why he needs his companions, he answers, \u201cO, reason not the need\u2026Allow not nature more than nature needs,/Man\u2019s life\u2019s as cheap as beast\u2019s.\u201d2 The austere lifestyle of lockdown is a reminder that we yearn for more than mere survival; being deprived of human presence has made me recognize how entwined our needs are with others\u2019. I miss giving friends and patients hugs\u2014even the formal if still infectious gesture of a handshake.\nMeanwhile, the bare necessities for survival are reported to be critically low or depleted at area hospitals: personal protective equipment, sufficient staffing, and in many cases, ventilators are required to safely care for COVID-19 patients. \u201cThe art of our necessities is strange,/That can make vile things precious.\u201d2 Who could have imagined that the masks and gowns we ran through so routinely would become such prized commodities?\nOf late, I have shuddered to witness the explosive ire of strangers in grocery stores or on my way to work\u2014to say nothing of the tensions in the hospital. Lear too is incensed by characters who wrong him, but over the course of his travails, he comes to a startling awareness of their anguish: \u201cwe are not ourselves,\u201d he says, \u201cWhen nature, being oppress\u2019d, commands the mind/To suffer with the body.\u201d2 Lear discerns that, when taxed by illness or affliction, we may not behave our best, and I hold this lesson close when I encounter people who act harshly. Besides, I need only look the other way to find those offering to help in sundry ways\u2014from donating supplies to walking dogs to simply checking in. These people act in tune with Lear\u2019s reflection on the suffering he newly registers:\nPoor naked wretches, whereso\u2019er you are,\nThat bide the pelting of this pitiless storm,\nHow shall your household heads and unfed sides,\nYour loop\u2019d and window\u2019d raggedness, defend you\nFrom seasons such as these? O, I have ta\u2019en\nToo little care of this! Take physic, pomp;\nExpose thyself to feel what wretches feel,\nThat thou mayst shake the superflux to them,\nAnd show the heavens more just.2\nOnly by enduring the \u201cpitiless storm\u201d does Lear arrive at this plane of wisdom and charity. I hope that the current conditions that ravage all comers may compel our compassion, that we may in turn show up for each other to \u201cshow the heavens more just.\u201d\nIndeed this, our plague, may help us find solidarity where we once only saw difference. While wandering in the storm, Lear looks upon a naked man and remarks on the elemental connection they share: \u201cThou art the thing itself:/unaccommodated man is no more but such a poor bare,/forked animal as thou art. Off, off, you lendings!\u201d2 We wear but borrowed garments, live on borrowed time, and the sooner we recognize our common humanity, the sooner we may ease each other\u2019s suffering. That very man on whom Lear waxed poetic says as much: \u201cWho alone suffers suffers most i\u2019 the mind,/Leaving free things and happy shows behind:/But then the mind much sufferance doth o\u2019er skip,/When grief hath mates, and bearing fellowship.\u201d2 This fellowship is hard to feel when we are confined to our separate spheres; however, although we must physically distance, we can depend on various outlets to remain socially anchored\u2014phone calls, FaceTime, Twitter chats, letters, texts; even art and literature, contemporary and indeed stretching back to early modern England.\nOne of the most enigmatic and entertaining characters in King Lear is the Fool. The Fool in literature is perhaps the best representation of gallows humor, the balm of wit to soothe but not delude the anguished mind. As Lear rages at the storm, \u201cNone but the fool\u201d accompanies him, \u201cwho labours to out-jest/His heart-struck injuries.\u201d2 The Fool, one might say, speaks truth to power, chiding Lear for his misjudgments and goading on his reason from the relatively safe promontory of humor. An outsider and insider, the Fool is a topsy-turvy observer who provides an apt commentary on the follies of mankind. He beseeches Lear to \u201ckeep a schoolmaster that can teach/thy fool to lie: I would fain learn to lie.\u201d2 But lie he cannot, and we might learn from his example in applying humor to represent inconvenient truths\u2014and certainly as a means to cope.\nIn many ways, the Fool is a foil to Cordelia, Lear\u2019s soft-spoken, gold-hearted daughter. In past readings, I remember warming to Cordelia\u2019s philosophy to \u201cLove, and be silent.\u201d2 But that declaration feels puny now, when all the world necessarily is a stage and we need to speak up to move others. We cannot afford her \u201ctardiness in nature/Which often leaves the history unspoke/That it intends to do.\u201d2 Instead, we must be as transparent and emphatic as possible about what is happening, hoping it will reach people who can help repair our health care system, public health policy, and moral erosion among the nation\u2019s leaders. Even as he\u2019s dying, the play\u2019s amoral and ruthless antagonist Edmund undergoes a change of villainous heart when he hears his older brother Edgar (Lear\u2019s godson) narrate his personal tragedy: \u201cThis speech of yours hath moved me,/And shall perchance do good.\u201d2 Words compel action, for better or for worse. The play concludes with the proclamation: \u201cThe weight of this sad time we must obey;/Speak what we feel, not what we ought to say.\u201d2 These words reverberate: now is not the time to be silent or restrained by custom but rather to speak honestly and steadfastly into the void.3\nWhether or not we inhabit a new world, we may claim new vision in confronting COVID-19. Let us harness this insight and learn to live more deliberately for the enormity of what we are witnessing. Lear\u2019s friend and ally, the Earl of Gloucester, after his eyes are brutally plucked out, laments, \u201cI stumbled when I saw: full oft \u2019tis seen,/Our means secure us, and our mere defects/Prove our commodities.\u201d2 Henceforth, he comes to approach the world differently: \u201cI see it feelingly.\u201d2 At this time, when we cannot see the way forward clearly, may we all see the world \u201cfeelingly,\u201d our hearts and minds engaged. This way of seeing contrasts with those unwilling to see things as they are. The corruption of vision of some of our national leaders, for example, follows a centuries-old pattern, as Lear tells Gloucester, \u201cGet thee glass eyes;/And like a scurvy politician, seem/To see the things thou dost not.\u201d2\nYet for every apparent villain, there are many people striving to salvage our society, whether by staying home, delivering mail, stocking groceries, disposing of waste, or laboring in the hospital. In the face of this relentless rain, when I feel most tempted to despair, I need only remember Edgar\u2019s words to his embattled father: \u201cMen must endure/Their going hence, even as their coming hither;/Ripeness is all: come on.\u201d2 And come on we must, moved to action but also, as we need it, to repose, recognizing we all have a part to play in the drama that unfolds. Even under lockdown, each of us has the capacity to shape what happens next. Together, we must endure\u2014separate, for now, but connected.\nBack to top\nArticle Information\nCorresponding Author: Anoushka Sinha, MD, MS, Pediatric Residency Training Program, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, 630 W 168th St, CHN-517, New York, NY 10032 (as4531@cumc.columbia.edu).\nPublished Online: April 10, 2020. doi:10.1001/jama.2020.6186\nConflict of Interest Disclosures: None reported.\nReferences\n1.\n@rosannecash.

Given the continual spread of COVID-19 around the world, understanding the action items that were implemented quickly in Taiwan and assessing the effectiveness of these actions in preventing a large-scale epidemic may be instructive for other countries.\nCOVID-19 occurred just before the Lunar New Year during which time millions of Chinese and Taiwanese were expected to travel for the holidays. Taiwan quickly mobilized and instituted specific approaches for case identification, containment, and resource allocation to protect the public health. Taiwan leveraged its national health insurance database and integrated it with its immigration and customs database to begin the creation of big data for analytics; it generated real-time alerts during a clinical visit based on travel history and clinical symptoms to aid case identification. It also used new technology, including QR code scanning and online reporting of travel history and health symptoms to classify travelers\u2019 infectious risks based on flight origin and travel history in the past 14 days. Persons with low risk (no travel to level 3 alert areas) were sent a health declaration border pass via SMS (short message service) messaging to their phones for faster immigration clearance; those with higher risk (recent travel to level 3 alert areas) were quarantined at home and tracked through their mobile phone to ensure that they remained at home during the incubation period.\nMoreover, Taiwan enhanced COVID-19 case finding by proactively seeking out patients with severe respiratory symptoms (based on information from the National Health Insurance [NHI] database) who had tested negative for influenza and retested them for COVID-19; 1 was found of 113 cases. The toll-free number 1922 served as a hotline for citizens to report suspicious symptoms or cases in themselves or others; as the disease progressed, this hotline has reached full capacity, so each major city was asked to create its own hotline as an alternative. It is not known how often this hotline has been used. The government addressed the issue of disease stigma and compassion for those affected by providing food, frequent health checks, and encouragement for those under quarantine. This rapid response included hundreds of action items (eTable in the Supplement).\nRecognizing the Crisis\nIn 2004, the year after the SARS outbreak, the Taiwan government established the National Health Command Center (NHCC). The NHCC is part of a disaster management center that focuses on large-outbreak response and acts as the operational command point for direct communications among central, regional, and local authorities. The NHCC unified a central command system that includes the Central Epidemic Command Center (CECC), the Biological Pathogen Disaster Command Center, the Counter-Bioterrorism Command Center, and the Central Medical Emergency Operations Center.5\nOn December 31, 2019, when the World Health Organization was notified of pneumonia of unknown cause in Wuhan, China, Taiwanese officials began to board planes and assess passengers on direct flights from Wuhan for fever and pneumonia symptoms before passengers could deplane. As early as January 5, 2020, notification was expanded to include any individual who had traveled to Wuhan in the past 14 days and had a fever or symptoms of upper respiratory tract infection at the point of entry; suspected cases were screened for 26 viruses including SARS and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). Passengers displaying symptoms of fever and coughing were quarantined at home and assessed whether medical attention at a hospital was necessary. On January 20, while sporadic cases were reported from China, the Taiwan Centers for Disease Control (CDC) officially activated the CECC for severe special infectious pneumonia under NHCC, with the minister of health and welfare as the designated commander. The CECC coordinated efforts by various ministries, including the ministries of transportation, economics, labor, and education and the Environmental Protection Administration, among others, in a comprehensive effort to counteract the emerging public health crisis.\nManaging the Crisis\nFor the past 5 weeks (January 20-February 24), the CECC has rapidly produced and implemented a list of at least 124 action items (eTable in the Supplement) including border control from the air and sea, case identification (using new data and technology), quarantine of suspicious cases, proactive case finding, resource allocation (assessing and managing capacity), reassurance and education of the public while fighting misinformation, negotiation with other countries and regions, formulation of policies toward schools and childcare, and relief to businesses.\nBorder Control, Case Identification, and Containment\nOn January 27, the National Health Insurance Administration (NHIA) and the National Immigration Agency integrated patients\u2019 past 14-day travel history with their NHI identification card data from the NHIA; this was accomplished in 1 day. Taiwan citizens\u2019 household registration system and the foreigners\u2019 entry card allowed the government to track individuals at high risk because of recent travel history in affected areas. Those identified as high risk (under home quarantine) were monitored electronically through their mobile phones. On January 30, the NHIA database was expanded to cover the past 14-day travel history for patients from China, Hong Kong, and Macau. On February 14, the Entry Quarantine System was launched, so travelers can complete the health declaration form by scanning a QR code that leads to an online form, either prior to departure from or upon arrival at a Taiwan airport. A mobile health declaration pass was then sent via SMS to phones using a local telecom operator, which allowed for faster immigration clearance for those with minimal risk. This system was created within a 72-hour period. On February 18, the government announced that all hospitals, clinics, and pharmacies in Taiwan would have access to patients\u2019 travel histories.\nResource Allocation: Logistics and Operations\nThe CECC took an active role in resource allocation, including setting the price of masks and using government funds and military personnel to increase mask production. On January 20, the Taiwan CDC announced that the government had under its control a stockpile of 44 million surgical masks, 1.9 million N95 masks, and 1100 negative-pressure isolation rooms.\nCommunications and Politics\nReassure and Educate the Public, While Fighting Misinformation\nIn addition to daily press briefings by the minister of health and welfare the CECC, the vice president of Taiwan, a prominent epidemiologist, gave regular public service announcements broadcast from the office of the president and made available via the internet. These announcements included when and where to wear a mask, the importance of handwashing, and the danger of hoarding masks to prevent them from becoming unavailable to frontline health workers. The CECC also made plans to assist schools, businesses, and furloughed workers (eTable in the Supplement).\nTaiwan\u2019s Outcomes so Far (as of February 24)\nInterim Outcomes\nThe CECC has communicated to the public in a clear and compassionate manner. Based on a poll of 1079 randomly selected people conducted by the Taiwan Public Opinion Foundation on February 17 and 18, the minister of health and welfare received approval ratings of more than 80% for his handling of the crisis, and the president and the premier received an overall approval rating of close to 70%. As of February 24, Taiwan has 30 cases of COVID-19. These cases represent the 10th-highest case number among countries affected thus far, but far fewer than the initial models predicting that Taiwan would have the second-highest importation risk.\nChallenges\nFirst, real-time public communications were mostly in Mandarin Chinese and sign language. Other than the Taiwan CDC website, there was not enough communication in different languages to non-Taiwanese citizens traveling or residing in Taiwan. Second, while its attention was focused on air travel, Taiwan permitted the docking of the Diamond Princess cruise ship and allowed passengers to disembark in Keelung, near New Taipei City, on January 31, before the ship left for Japan. The ship was subsequently found to have numerous confirmed infections onboard. This created a temporary public panic with concern about community spread. The government published the 50 locations where the cruise ship travelers may have visited and asked citizens who may have been in contact with the tour group to conduct symptom monitoring and self-quarantine if necessary. None were confirmed to have COVID-19 after 14 days had passed. Third, whether the intensive nature of these policies can be maintained until the end of the epidemic and continue to be well received by the public is unclear.\nConclusions\nTaiwan\u2019s government learned from its 2003 SARS experience and established a public health response mechanism for enabling rapid actions for the next crisis. Well-trained and experienced teams of officials were quick to recognize the crisis and activated emergency management structures to address the emerging outbreak.\nIn a crisis, governments often make difficult decisions under uncertainty and time constraints. These decisions must be both culturally appropriate and sensitive to the population. Through early recognition of the crisis, daily briefings to the public, and simple health messaging, the government was able to reassure the public by delivering timely, accurate, and transparent information regarding the evolving epidemic. Taiwan is an example of how a society can respond quickly to a crisis and protect the interests of its citizens.\nBack to top\nArticle Information\nCorresponding Author: C.

After the initial peak, absent highly effective medical interventions, the US will likely experience outbreaks of lingering disease for months and potentially years to come. As the US enters the next phase of COVID-19, critical questions will involve the nation\u2019s capacity to respond to outbreaks, protect high-risk populations, and limit community spread.\nBecause of inadequate and continued lack of testing for COVID-19, a depleted and overworked public health workforce, lack of sophisticated integrated public health and clinical health information technology, and substantial cultural issues, the US has yet to implement an effective disease control strategy. Rather, the US has moved quickly from focused isolation and quarantine at a large scale to mitigation, largely focused on a single approach\u2014social distancing. The fundamental question is whether the US can build a more targeted response capability so that the country can return to work, school, and other normal activities.\nA key milestone is the fall of 2020. If the initial social distancing and perhaps warmer temperatures reduce the scale of the outbreak this summer, there is a major risk of a resurgence during the traditional season of respiratory viruses. As a possible approach to respond to this challenge, the US should consider suspending the first year of medical school for 1 year and giving the incoming 20\u202f000 medical students the opportunity to join a national service program for public health. Hopefully the vast majority of students would participate. Such a bold approach may be needed to ensure that the US has an adequate response to the next wave of disease and does not enter a prolonged depression that will further adversely affect the health of its citizens.\nThe program should begin at the start of July. Incoming medical students should spend the month in online training on infectious disease epidemiology, infectious disease control in high-risk settings, and outbreak response. In August, they should deploy to state and local public health departments to enhance the capacity to support a test, trace, track, and quarantine strategy. The federal government should fund this project as a national service effort with a salary for the students and health coverage; it could be part of a larger initiative to engage other students, including those in nursing and public health, as well as out-of-work community members in the national response.\nTaking this bold step is justified on health and economic grounds. Today, localities have few resources available to stop community spread other than closing businesses, curtailing large gatherings, and schooling at home. As soon as the novel coronavirus arrives in a community, many are at risk for falling ill, straining the health care system, causing fear, and devastating the economy. Communities must use the next few months to build a robust public health response. It is in part this capacity that has allowed Singapore, Taiwan, and South Korea to respond more successfully to the coronavirus challenge.\nMedical students should deploy to state and local health agencies for a variety of roles. One urgent task is to implement rapid testing that informs community surveillance. Even today, only a small fraction of people with suggestive symptoms can be rapidly tested; in some acute care settings, even the sickest patients wait days for the result. Access to testing is so haphazard that it is difficult to draw reliable inferences about incidence, prevalence, and populations at risk. As testing becomes more available\u2014results available within hours\u2014there will be an urgent need to use these data to assess the scope of the epidemic. Whereas the lack of adequate testing and surveillance has been a major weakness of the initial response, it must not be by the fall.\nA second urgent task is to enhance protection of high-risk populations, with the goal of reducing the likelihood and effect of outbreaks now occurring in nursing homes and prisons. Medical students should help ensure implementation of critical preventive policies and join teams that swiftly and aggressively respond to infections that occur.\nA third role for medical students should be to staff community call centers that offer guidance and services to individuals with symptoms of or exposure to COVID-19. In addition to arranging testing, medical students would ensure that adequate information has been collected from individuals who require quarantine. This information could facilitate efforts to provide food delivery at home, alternative housing if necessary, and additional medical treatment as needed.\nThere is precedent for such a massive mobilization to address infectious disease. To reduce the spread of Ebola, Liberia mobilized thousands of case workers. China reportedly used 18\u202f000 public health workers in Wuhan alone.1 US public health departments have seen major losses of staff over the past decade.2\nHundreds of medical students have already found ways to help in the response to COVID-19, from offering childcare to health care workers to taking on short-term roles in the health care system.3 Now it is time to formalize an opportunity for future physicians to protect the nation at this critical moment. Paired with other students as well as with community health workers and other local resources, having 20\u202f000 capable medical students as a source of energy and enthusiasm can contribute to a successful response.\nMobilizing future physicians now will complicate medical education in the short-term and the medical workforce 4 years from now. But there are solutions to these challenges. For example, because fewer students means less tuition revenue, the federal government should compensate medical schools for a portion of this lost income.\nIn July 2025, there will be a gap in medical students available for internships, and in 2026, there will be an excess number of graduates for available residency positions. To address the former problem, licensing authorities that oversee undergraduate and graduate medical education should permit medical schools to offer early graduation to highly capable students, and graduate medical education should make adjustments to reduce the reliance on first-year residents. To address the latter concern, future classes of medical students should be afforded the opportunity for national service before starting medical school, ideally in a broad range of health and social service settings.\nThere are other challenges. This initiative will be expensive, but potential benefits to economic recovery would be substantial, and financially many would benefit. State and local Departments of Public Health likely do not have the capacity to hire and train a new workforce in such short order. The federal government should direct resources for this purpose to the local level that permit creative partnerships with the private sector to be able to hire and deploy people quickly. As demonstrated in Taiwan,4 health information technology that flows seamlessly between public health and clinical medicine is critically important. In the US, health care information is compartmentalized and siloed in ways that make a national effort to test, trace, track, and quarantine difficult to implement. This problem must be solved quickly to facilitate the response. The logistics of such a program are substantial, and time is short, but without such an effort, the US could well find itself largely shut down this fall.\nHow and when this initial surge of patients with COVID-19 ends remains uncertain. There is also much unknown about the effectiveness of social distancing, the transmission in the warmer months, and development of new therapies and vaccines. Even as there is hope of a major therapeutic advance, preparation is essential for the likelihood that the disease will continue. To return to work, education, and other activities as soon as possible, the nation should move swiftly to build a robust public health response, drawing upon a workforce that includes future physicians.\nBack to top\nArticle Information\nCorresponding Author: Howard Bauchner, MD, Editor in Chief, JAMA (howard.bauchner@jamanetwork.org).\nPublished Online: April 8, 2020. doi:10.1001/jama.2020.6166\nConflict of Interest Disclosures: None reported.\nAdditional Information: Dr Sharfstein reported serving as Principal Deputy Commissioner of the US Food and Drug Administration from March 2009 to January 2011.\nReferences\n1.\nMcNeil  DG\ufeff .

Thus, the incidence of community transmission by persons with mild illness and without risk factors remains ill-defined.\nThe current public health strategy of case containment is premised on the assumption of no or limited community transmission. Identifying a high rate of community transmission would indicate a need to shift the public health strategy from containment to mitigation of spread. Thus, determining the rate at which mild disease is spreading in the community, particularly among persons without risk factors for acquisition of the virus, is critically important.\nWe conducted a rapid sentinel surveillance study to determine what proportion of mild, outpatient influenzalike illnesses were caused by SARS-CoV-2.\nMethods\nBetween March 12-13 and 15-16, 2020, the Los Angeles County + University of Southern California Medical Center conducted testing among patients presenting with mild influenzalike illness to the emergency department or urgent care. Patients who had nasopharyngeal swabs tested with polymerase chain reaction assays for influenza and respiratory syncytial virus (GeneXpert Flu, Cepheid) were automatically tested for SARS-CoV-2 (Quest Diagnostics).\nOnly the influenza tests conducted during the day shift were automatically tested for SARS-CoV-2 because the process was manual. Patients were excluded if they had specific risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 (eg, travel exposure or known contact with a traveler, severely ill patients admitted for respiratory tract infections). Positive test results were followed up by Department of Public Health experts to assess clinical factors and demographics.\nThe number of influenza tests ordered by physicians at the Los Angeles County + University of Southern California Medical Center between March 2 and March 18, 2020, and the proportion testing positive for influenza were also assessed. In addition, the rate of influenzalike illnesses obtained from weekly surveys of emergency departments over the past 5 years were summarized, as well as the percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza from ongoing public health sentinel surveillance conducted at 7 clinical laboratories across Los Angeles County, California.\nThis study was approved as expedited with a waiver of informed consent by the University of Southern California health sciences campus institutional review board.\nResults\nOne hundred thirty-one tests for SARS-CoV-2 were obtained and 7 were positive (5.3%; 95% CI, 2.2%-10.7%). The median age of patients who tested positive was 38 years (range, 34-44 years), 3 were male (43%), and the median duration of symptoms was 4 days (range, 2-4 days) at presentation. Six of 7 patients presented with fever, 5 with myalgias, and only 1 with cough. Only 1 patient had a travel history (returned from Miami, Florida). All patients had mild illnesses, and all tested negative for influenza and respiratory syncytial virus.\nAt the Los Angeles County + University of Southern California Medical Center, the number of influenza tests ordered by physicians was relatively stable, but the percentage of positive test results for influenza declined around the time of the study (Figure 1). Across the county, sentinel testing revealed a third seasonal spike in influenzalike illnesses during the weeks before the study; no third seasonal spike was seen during the prior 4 years, and the third spike occurred later than any spike during those years (Figure 2A). This late, third seasonal influenzalike illness spike occurred even as the percentage of respiratory specimens that tested positive for influenza steadily declined (Figure 2B).\nDiscussion\nThe 5% rate of SARS-CoV-2 among patients with mild influenzalike illness without risk factors is concerning. These patients had sufficiently mild illness to be active in the community throughout their illness, increasing the possibility of transmission. Such transmission is consistent with the unusual, third countywide influenzalike illness spike that occurred late in the season and with declining rates of influenza positivity.\nThe primary limitations of the study were the sampling for a brief period at 1 medical center and SARS-CoV-2 testing only being conducted during the day. Nevertheless, the results suggested that containment efforts were unlikely to succeed and helped inform the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health to adopt a more aggressive mitigation strategy to reduce COVID-19 morbidity and mortality. Similar efforts may be needed in other jurisdictions.\nSection Editor: Jody W.

Knowledge of diagnostic tests for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is still evolving, and a clear understanding of the nature of the tests and interpretation of their findings is important. This Viewpoint describes how to interpret 2 types of diagnostic tests commonly in use for SARS-CoV-2 infections\u2014reverse transcriptase\u2013polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and IgM and IgG enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)\u2014and how the results may vary over time (Figure).\nFigure.  Estimated Variation Over Time in Diagnostic Tests for Detection of SARS-CoV-2 Infection Relative to Symptom Onset\nView LargeDownload\nEstimated time intervals and rates of viral detection are based on data from several published reports. Because of variability in values among studies, estimated time intervals should be considered approximations and the probability of detection of SARS-CoV-2 infection is presented qualitatively. SARS-CoV-2 indicates severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; PCR, polymerase chain reaction.\naDetection only occurs if patients are followed up proactively from the time of exposure.\nbMore likely to register a negative than a positive result by PCR of a nasopharyngeal swab.\nDetection of Viral RNA by RT-PCR\nThus far, the most commonly used and reliable test for diagnosis of COVID-19 has been the RT-PCR test performed using nasopharyngeal swabs or other upper respiratory tract specimens, including throat swab or, more recently, saliva. A variety of RNA gene targets are used by different manufacturers, with most tests targeting 1 or more of the envelope (env), nucleocapsid (N), spike (S), RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), and ORF1 genes. The sensitivities of the tests to individual genes are comparable according to comparison studies except the RdRp-SARSr (Charit\u00e9) primer probe, which has a slightly lower sensitivity likely due to a mismatch in the reverse primer.1\nIn most individuals with symptomatic COVID-19 infection, viral RNA in the nasopharyngeal swab as measured by the cycle threshold (Ct) becomes detectable as early as day 1 of symptoms and peaks within the first week of symptom onset. The Ct is the number of replication cycles required to produce a fluorescent signal, with lower Ct values representing higher viral RNA loads. A Ct value less than 40 is clinically reported as PCR positive. This positivity starts to decline by week 3 and subsequently becomes undetectable. However, the Ct values obtained in severely ill hospitalized patients are lower than the Ct values of mild cases, and PCR positivity may persist beyond 3 weeks after illness onset when most mild cases will yield a negative result.2 However, a \u201cpositive\u201d PCR result reflects only the detection of viral RNA and does not necessarily indicate presence of viable virus.3\nIn some cases, viral RNA has been detected by RT-PCR even beyond week 6 following the first positive test. A few cases have also been reported positive after 2 consecutive negative PCR tests performed 24 hours apart. It is unclear if this is a testing error, reinfection, or reactivation. In a study of 9 patients, attempts to isolate the virus in culture were not successful beyond day 8 of illness onset, which correlates with the decline of infectivity beyond the first week.3 That is in part why the \u201csymptom-based strategy\u201d of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) indicates that health care workers can return to work, if \u201cat least 3 days (72 hours) have passed since recovery defined as resolution of fever without the use of fever-reducing medications and improvement in respiratory symptoms (e.g., cough, shortness of breath); and, at least 10 days have passed since symptoms first appeared.\u201d4\nThe timeline of PCR positivity is different in specimens other than nasopharyngeal swab. PCR positivity declines more slowly in sputum and may still be positive after nasopharyngeal swabs are negative.3 In one study, PCR positivity in stool was observed in 55 of 96 (57%) infected patients and remained positive in stool beyond nasopharyngeal swab by a median of 4 to 11 days, but was unrelated to clinical severity.2 Persistence of PCR in sputum and stool was found to be similar as assessed by W\u00f6lfel et al.3\nIn a study of 205 patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection, RT-PCR positivity was highest in bronchoalveolar lavage specimens (93%), followed by sputum (72%), nasal swab (63%), and pharyngeal swab (32%).5 False-negative results mainly occurred due to inappropriate timing of sample collection in relation to illness onset and deficiency in sampling technique, especially of nasopharyngeal swabs. Specificity of most of the RT-PCR tests is 100% because the primer design is specific to the genome sequence of SARS-CoV-2. Occasional false-positive results may occur due to technical errors and reagent contamination.\nDetection of Antibodies to SARS-CoV-2\nCOVID-19 infection can also be detected indirectly by measuring the host immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Serological diagnosis is especially important for patients with mild to moderate illness who may present late, beyond the first 2 weeks of illness onset. Serological diagnosis also is becoming an important tool to understand the extent of COVID-19 in the community and to identify individuals who are immune and potentially \u201cprotected\u201d from becoming infected.\nThe most sensitive and earliest serological marker is total antibodies, levels of which begin to increase from the second week of symptom onset.6 Although IgM and IgG ELISA have been found to be positive even as early as the fourth day after symptom onset, higher levels occur in the second and third week of illness.\nFor example, IgM and IgG seroconversion occurred in all patients between the third and fourth week of clinical illness onset as measured in 23 patients by To et al7 and 85 patients by Xiang et al.8 Thereafter IgM begins to decline and reaches lower levels by week 5 and almost disappears by week 7, whereas IgG persists beyond 7 weeks.9 In a study of 140 patients, combined sensitivity of PCR and IgM ELISA directed at nucleocapsid (NC) antigen was 98.6% vs 51.9% with a single PCR test. During the first 5.5 days, quantitative PCR had a higher positivity rate than IgM, whereas IgM ELISA had a higher positivity rate after day 5.5 of illness.10\nELISA-based IgM and IgG antibody tests have greater than 95% specificity for diagnosis of COVID-19. Testing of paired serum samples with the initial PCR and the second 2 weeks later can further increase diagnostic accuracy. Typically, the majority of antibodies are produced against the most abundant protein of the virus, which is the NC. Therefore, tests that detect antibodies to NC would be the most sensitive. However, the receptor-binding domain of S (RBD-S) protein is the host attachment protein, and antibodies to RBD-S would be more specific and are expected to be neutralizing. Therefore, using one or both antigens for detecting IgG and IgM would result in high sensitivity.7 Antibodies may, however, have cross-reactivity with SARS-CoV and possibly other coronaviruses.\nRapid point-of-care tests for detection of antibodies have been widely developed and marketed and are of variable quality. Many manufacturers do not reveal the nature of antigens used. These tests are purely qualitative in nature and can only indicate the presence or absence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. The presence of neutralizing antibodies can only be confirmed by a plaque reduction neutralization test. However, high titers of IgG antibodies detected by ELISA have been shown to positively correlate with neutralizing antibodies.7 The long-term persistence and duration of protection conferred by the neutralizing antibodies remains unknown.\nConclusions\nUsing available evidence, a clinically useful timeline of diagnostic markers for detection of COVID-19 has been devised (Figure). Most of the available data are for adult populations who are not immunocompromised. The time course of PCR positivity and seroconversion may vary in children and other groups, including the large population of asymptomatic individuals who go undiagnosed without active surveillance. Many questions remain, particularly how long potential immunity lasts in individuals, both asymptomatic and symptomatic, who are infected with SARS-CoV-2.\nBack to top\nArticle Information\nCorresponding Author: Sundararaj Stanleyraj Jeremiah, MD, Department of Microbiology and Molecular Biodefense Research, Yokohama City University School of Medicine, 3-9 Fukuura, Kanazawa-ku, Yokohama 236-0004, Japan (rediffjerry@gmail.com).\nPublished Online: May 6, 2020. doi:10.1001/jama.2020.8259\nConflict of Interest Disclosures: None reported.\nReferences\n1.\nNalla  AK\ufeff , Casto  AM\ufeff , Huang  MW\ufeff ,  et al.

To reduce or avoid cross infection of COVID-19, many hospitals have started taking actions to limit the number of outpatient visits and inpatient admissions. For example, only emergency surgeries can be guaranteed, while most others are postponed. Maintenance chemotherapy and/or immunotherapy treatments for patients with advanced cancer are often suspended. However, forced delays or interruptions of routine treatment might increase the risk of disease deterioration, especially for patients with cancer. In China, approximately 4.3 million cases of cancer are diagnosed each year.2 During the epidemic of COVID-19, the treatment of patients with cancer, which is often considered as nonemergent, is inevitably affected across China, especially in Wuhan.\nAs a result of powerful prevention and control measures, the spread of COVID-19 has been gradually controlled. However, cases have been diagnosed in a number of countries outside of China, especially in South Korea and Iran, leading to a global outbreak. As of March 3, 2020, newly diagnosed cases and deaths owing to COVID-19 had occurred in nearly 70 countries or regions, including South Korea, Iran, Italy, Japan, Germany, Singapore, Spain, and the US, with a total of 11\u202f953 confirmed cases.3 The insidious onset (which can manifest without any obvious clinical symptoms, such as fever, in the early phase) and long incubation period (up to 24 days4) indicate the strong transmissibility of COVID-19. The World Health Organization has declared COVID-19 to be a \u201cpublic health emergency of international concern.\u201d5 Therefore, it may have a worldwide influence on the diagnosis and treatment of patients with cancer.\nPatients with cancer are usually characterized by older ages, multiple complicated diseases, and lower immunity, meaning a higher probability of severe illness and increased mortality compared with the healthy population once infected with COVID-19.6 To alleviate the difficulties of patients with cancer in seeking medical aid and simultaneously avoid COVID-19\u2013related nosocomial cross infection between patients and medical staff, several mandatory measures are being carried out in the National Cancer Center/Cancer Hospital, Chinese Academy of Sciences during this period.\nFirst, multiple on-site temperature tests are performed at the entrances of the hospital, the outpatient clinic, and the wards. Also, the contact and travel histories regarding the epidemic area of all individuals are recorded.\nSecond, an appointment scheduling system is available for outpatients, which allows both online appointment scheduling and on-site registration. The appointment system substantially reduced the flow of people in the hospital. For admitted patients, essential personal protective measures are required (such as wearing a mask and bringing their own disinfectant). Furthermore, online consultation channels for patients with cancer are open daily, which could help to instruct patients on medication taking and cancer-related symptom management.\nThird, for patients preparing to be admitted, symptoms that are potentially associated with COVID-19, such as fever and cough, are required to be routinely recorded. Mandatory routine blood tests and high-resolution computed tomography scans of the lungs are performed. COVID-19 virus nucleic acid tests will be carried out for patients with suspected pneumonia on computed tomography imaging.\nFourth, some anticancer drugs conventionally administered through infusion were changed to orally administered drugs if available, for example, etoposide and vinorelbine. For adjuvant chemotherapy or maintenance chemotherapy, the infusion intervals were appropriately prolonged depending on patients\u2019 conditions.\nAfter the Chinese Spring Festival, the Cancer Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences initiated the level-1 response (the highest emergency response measures) to COVID-19. From February 12, 2020, to March 2, 2020, the Department of Medical Oncology received a total of 2944 patients for clinic consultation and treatment in the wards, including 2795 outpatients and 149 inpatients. Under the strict screening strategy, 27 patients showed radiologic manifestations of inflammatory changes or multiple-site exudative pneumonia in the lungs, 8 of whom were suspected of having COVID-19 infection. Fortunately, negative results from nucleic acid testing ultimately excluded COVID-19 infection in all these patients. Importantly, 2 of these patients presented with recovered pneumonia after symptomatic treatment. Under the strict protective measures, not a single patient or staff member had been diagnosed with COVID-19 infection as of March 3, 2020.\nUnder the further attack of COVID-19 worldwide, more attention should be paid to patients with cancer as a special population. Both the effective prevention of cross infection of COVID-19 and the rational arrangement of anticancer treatment are extremely important. The measures we are taking may be of great value to help guide patients with cancer smoothly and safely through the epidemic.\nBack to top\nArticle Information\nCorresponding Authors: Jie Wang, MD, PhD, Department of Medical Oncology (zlhuxi@163.com), and Jie He, MD, Department of Thoracic Surgery (hejie@cicams.ac.cn), State Key Laboratory of Molecular Oncology, National Cancer Center/National Clinical Research Center for Cancer/Cancer Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, 17 Pan-jia-yuan S Ln, Chaoyang District, Beijing 100021, China.\nPublished Online: April 1, 2020. doi:10.1001/jamaoncol.2020.1198\nConflict of Interest Disclosures: None reported.\nAdditional Contributions: The authors would like to thank Shangli Cai, PhD, Burning Rock Biotech, for the data collection.

These predictions have far-reaching consequences regarding how quickly and how strongly governments move to curb an epidemic. However, the primary and most effective use of epidemiological models is to estimate the relative effect of various interventions in reducing disease burden rather than to produce precise quantitative predictions about extent or duration of disease burdens. For predictions, \u201cmodels are not crystal balls,\u201d as Ferguson noted in a recent overview of the role of modeling.1\nNevertheless, consumers of epidemiological models, including politicians, the public, and the media, often focus on the quantitative predictions of infections and mortality estimates. Such measures of potential disease burden are necessary for planners who consider future outcomes in light of health care capacity. How then should such estimates be assessed?\nAlthough relative effects on infections associated with various interventions are likely more reliable, accompanying estimates from models about COVID-19 can contribute to uncertainty and anxiety. For instance, will the US have tens of thousands or possibly even hundreds of thousands of deaths? The main focus should be on the kinds of interventions that could help reduce these numbers because the interventions undertaken will, of course, determine the eventual numerical reality. Model projections are needed to forecast future health care demand, including how many intensive care unit beds will be needed, where and when shortages of ventilators will most likely occur, and the number of health care workers required to respond effectively. Short-term projections can be crucial to assist planning, but it is usually unnecessary to focus on long-term \u201cguesses\u201d for such purposes. In addition, forecasts from computational models are being used to establish local, state, and national policy. When is the peak of cases expected? If social distancing is effective and the number of new cases that require hospitalization is stable or declining, when is it time to consider a return to work or school? Can large gatherings once again be safe? For these purposes, models likely only give insight into the scale of what is ahead and cannot predict the exact trajectory of the epidemic weeks or months in advance. According to Whitty, models should not be presented as scientific truth; they are most helpful when they present more than what is predictable by common sense.2\nEstimates that emerge from modeling studies are only as good as the validity of the epidemiological or statistical model used; the extent and accuracy of the assumptions made; and, perhaps most importantly, the quality of the data to which models are calibrated. Early in an epidemic, the quality of data on infections, deaths, tests, and other factors often are limited by underdetection or inconsistent detection of cases, reporting delays, and poor documentation, all of which affect the quality of any model output. Simpler models may provide less valid forecasts because they cannot capture complex and unobserved human mixing patterns and other time-varying characteristics of infectious disease spread. On the other hand, as Kucharski noted, \u201ccomplex models may be no more reliable than simple ones if they miss key aspects of the biology. Complex models can create the illusion of realism, and make it harder to spot crucial omissions.\u201d3 A greater level of detail in a model may provide a more adequate description of an epidemic, but outputs are sensitive to changes in parametric assumptions and are particularly dependent on external preliminary estimates of disease and transmission characteristics, such as the length of the incubation and infectious periods.\nIn predicting the future of the COVID-19 pandemic, many key assumptions have been based on limited data. Models may capture aspects of epidemics effectively while neglecting to account for other factors, such as the accuracy of diagnostic tests; whether immunity will wane quickly; if reinfection could occur; or population characteristics, such as age distribution, percentage of older adults with comorbidities, and risk factors (eg, smoking, exposure to air pollution). Some critical variables, including the reproductive number (the average number of new infections associated with 1 infected person) and social distancing effects, can also change over time. However, many reports of models do not clearly report key assumptions that have been included or the sensitivity to errors in these assumptions.\nPredictive models for large countries, such as the US, are even more problematic because they aggregate heterogeneous subepidemics in local areas. Individual characteristics, such as age and comorbidities, influence risk of serious disease from COVID-19, but population distributions of these factors vary widely in the US. For example, the population of Colorado is characterized by a lower percentage of comorbidities than many southern states. The population in Florida is older than the population in Utah. Even within a state, key variables can vary substantially, such as the prevalence of important prognostic factors (eg, cardiovascular or pulmonary disease) or environmental factors (eg, population density, outdoor air pollution). Social distancing is more difficult to achieve in urban than in suburban or rural areas. In addition, variation in the accuracy of disease incidence and prevalence estimates may occur because of differences in testing between areas. Consequently, projections from various models have resulted in a wide range of possible outcomes. For instance, an early estimate suggested that COVID-19 could account for 480\u202f000 deaths in the US,4 whereas later models quoted by the White House Coronavirus Task Force indicated between 100\u202f000 and 240\u202f000 deaths, and more recent forecasts (as of April 12) suggest between 60\u202f000 and 80\u202f000 deaths.\nA recent model from the Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluation has received considerable attention and has been widely quoted by government officials.5 On the surface, the model yields specific predictions of the day on which COVID-19 deaths will peak in each state and the cumulative number of deaths expected over the next 4 months (with substantial uncertainty intervals). However, caveats in these projections may not be widely appreciated by the public or policy makers because the model has some important but opaque limitations. For instance, the predictions assumed similar effects from social distancing as were observed elsewhere in the world (particularly in Hubei, China), which is likely optimistic. The projected fatality model was not based on any epidemiological science and depended on current data on the reported prior increasing number of fatalities in each region\u2014data that are widely acknowledged to be undercounted and poorly reported6\u2014and did not consider the possibility of any second wave of infections. Although the Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluation is continuously updating projections as more data become available and they adapt their methods,7 long-term mortality projections already have shown substantial volatility; in New York, the model predicted a total of 10\u202f243 COVID-19 deaths on March 27, 2020, but the projected number of deaths had increased to 16\u202f262 by April 4, 2020\u2014a 60% increase in a matter of days. Some original projections were quickly at the edge of earlier uncertainty bands that were apparently not sufficiently wide.\nModels can be useful tools but should not be overinterpreted, particularly for long-term projections or subtle characteristics, such as the exact date of a peak number of infections. First, models need to be dynamic and not fixed to allow for important and unanticipated effects, which makes them only useful in the short term if accurate predictions are needed. To paraphrase Fauci: models do not determine the timeline, the virus makes the timeline.\nSecond, necessary assumptions should be clearly articulated and the sensitivity to these assumptions must be discussed. Other factors that are already known or thought to be associated with the pandemic, but not included in the model, should be delineated together with their qualitative implications for model performance. Third, rather than providing fixed, precise numbers, all forecasts from these models should be transparent by reporting ranges (such as CIs or uncertainty intervals) so that the variability and uncertainty of the predictions is clear. It is crucial that such intervals account for all potential sources of uncertainty, including data reporting errors and variation and effects of model misspecification, to the extent possible. Fourth, models should incorporate measures of their accuracy as additional or better data becomes available. If the projection from a model differs from other published predictions, it is important to resolve such differences. Fifth, the public reporting of estimates from these models, in scientific journals and especially in the media, must be appropriately circumspect and include key caveats to avoid the misinterpretation that these forecasts represent scientific truth.\nModels should also seek to use the best possible data for local predictions. It is unlikely that epidemics will follow identical paths in all regions of the world, even when important factors such as age distribution are considered. Local data should be used as soon as those data become available with reasonable accuracy. For projections of hospital needs, data on clinical outcomes among patients in local settings are likely to enable more accurate conclusions than poorly reported mortality data from across the world.\nAt a time when numbers of cases and deaths from COVID-19 continue to increase with alarming speed, accurate forecasts from mathematical models are increasingly important for physicians; epidemiologists; politicians; the public; and, most importantly, for individuals responsible for organizing care for the populations they serve. Given the unpredictable behavior of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, it is best to acknowledge that short-term projections are the most that can be expected with reasonable accuracy. Always assuming the worst-case scenario at state and national levels will lead to inefficiencies and competition for beds and supplies and may compromise effective delivery and quality of care, while assuming the best-case scenario can lead to disastrous underpreparation.\nModeling studies have contributed vital insights into the COVID-19 pandemic, and will undoubtedly continue to do so. Early models pointed to areas in which infection was likely widespread before large numbers of cases were detected; contributed to estimating the reproductive number, case fatality rate, and how long the virus had been circulating in a community; and helped to establish evidence that a significant amount of transmission occurs prior to symptom onset. Mathematical models can be profoundly helpful tools to make public health decisions and ensure optimal use of resources to reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, but only if they are rigorously evaluated and valid and their projections are robust and reliable.\nBack to top\nArticle Information\nCorresponding Author: Nicholas P.

Although the necessary focus has been to care for patients and communities, the emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 has disrupted medical education and requires intense and prompt attention from medical educators. The need to prepare future physicians has never been as focused as it is now in the setting of a global emergency. The profound effects of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) may forever change how future physicians are educated.\nThis pandemic presents practical and logistical challenges and concerns for patient safety, recognizing that students may potentially spread the virus when asymptomatic and may acquire the virus in the course of training. This Viewpoint discusses the current status of medical education, describes how COVID-19 may affect preclerkship and clerkship learning environments, and explores potential implications of COVID-19 for the future of medical education.\nMedical Student Education in 2020\nFor more than a decade, medical schools have been working to transform pedagogy by eliminating/reducing lectures; using technology to replace/enhance anatomy and laboratories; implementing team-facilitated, active, and self-directed learning; and promoting individualized and interprofessional education.1,2 The development of entrustable professional activities and competency-based learning with identified milestones for achievement have transformed assessment. Many schools have decreased the basic science curriculum to 12 or 18 months while integrating clinical medicine within this timeframe and revisiting the basic sciences later in medical school.3\nToday, in most medical schools, students convene in physical settings during the first 12 to 18 months for interactive problem-solving or discussions in small groups; their physical presence in both inpatient and outpatient settings has been an unquestioned tenet of early clinical immersion experiences and the clerkship curriculum. The last 18 months of medical school may be individualized, with students participating in advanced clinical rotations, subinternships prior to residency, or scholarly projects. COVID-19 has the potential to affect students throughout the educational process.\nHow COVID-19 Affects the Preclerkship Learning Environment\nSocial distancing is the most effective preventative strategy since the emergence of COVID-19 pending development of a vaccine, treatment, or both.4 By definition, this precludes students from gathering in learning studios, lecture halls, or small-group rooms. Within the past few years, many faculty were already \u201cflipping\u201d the classroom to provide individualized instruction for asynchronous learning \u201canytime/anywhere.\u201d However, students still convened for small-group interactions, laboratory sessions, simulations, and technology sessions (eg, learning bedside ultrasonography), as well as for clinical instruction with standardized patients and in authentic patient care environments.\nIn response to COVID-19, medical education faculty have quickly transitioned the entire preclerkship curriculum to online formats that include content in the basic sciences, health systems sciences, and even in behavioral sciences. Small-group formats convene online in virtual team settings, and clinical skills sessions may occur online or, in some cases, may be deferred. Examinations have also transitioned to online settings. Updating content material may be a benefit of the online format and virtual activities seem functional, but outcomes of these changes will require subsequent evaluation. The transition from the workplace or medical school setting to home results in isolation, an increased use of email, and struggles with establishing boundaries between work and home, which could affect faculty, students, and support staff.\nHow COVID-19 Affects the Clerkship Learning Environment\nWhat exactly is the role of the medical student in the clinical environment? Ideally, the student is part of the team as a learner who requires supervision. Formation of students\u2019 professional identity relies on teaching and role modeling in these settings as students learn to prioritize patients and aspire to altruism. The next question then is what level of student involvement during a crisis best represents this prioritization? In other disaster circumstances, including natural disasters, blackouts, fires, and the September 11 attacks, students were able to continue their education and help in the effort. However, with the emergence of a highly contagious pandemic, students may transmit the virus unknowingly or contract the disease. Other contributing factors that limit the role of students in this clinical environment include lack of COVID-19 testing; diminished value of education, with cancelation of surgical procedures and routine appointments and the transition to telehealth formats; and lack of adequate personal protective equipment (PPE).\nWith the initial emergence of COVID-19, students were not involved in the care of patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19, especially with the shortage of PPE. As infection rates increased, schools began to remove students from the clerkship environment and on March 17, 2020, the Association of American Medical Colleges provided guidelines suggesting that medical schools support pausing clinical rotations for medical students.5 However, specific geographic differences may lead schools to make individualized decisions based on unique circumstances.\nWhat then could educators do to create experiences for students who are usually assigned to inpatient or outpatient rotations? The options are continually evolving but may include consolidating and moving clinical didactic sessions online earlier to allow for later entry into the clinical environment; creating and using available virtual cases; modifying the academic calendar to exchange later experiences (eg, scholarly work) and defer clinical rotations; and involving students in the telehealth environment, including electives based on experiences students are pursuing to enable them to assist and learn in this critical situation.\nThere is uncertainty regarding how long this situation will persist and increasing recognition that there may be periods in the future after reengagement in a \u201cnew normal\u201d environment, in which quarantines and social distancing may again be required. The challenge is in providing authentic patient experiences for medical students as a key component of medical education under these circumstances. If schools defer clinical immersion experiences, there could be 2 full cohort classes of students in the clinical environment simultaneously and education could be adversely affected by the density of learners (which is already a problem in many geographic locations). Regarding accreditation, the Liaison Committee on Medical Education has provided resources to help medical schools.6\nWhat Does the Future Hold?\nThe medical education environment is cross-generational. The former mindset that physicians would work when they were ill was considered to be altruistic and professional, with prioritization of the patient above the physician. However, the situation that COVID-19 represents is different. Clinicians who come to work while they are ill, as well as those who may be asymptomatic and silently incubating the virus, might facilitate transmitting the virus to others. Therefore, the culture of professionalism and altruism must be redefined and take into consideration the effects of potential actions, even with good intentions. This is all the more difficult because of the lack of COVID-19 testing and limited availability of PPE.\nAdditional unknown academic issues will require attention, including standardized examinations when testing centers are closed, the timeline for residency applications for current third-year students, and the ability to meet requirements for certain subspecialties prior to applying to residency (eg, away rotations).\nHowever, learners across the continuum of education have participated in many ways to care for patients and communities in this crisis. In medical schools across the country, students are volunteering in call centers, creating patient education materials, and helping with grocery shopping, among other activities, while adhering to physical separation, safe travel (walking, biking, or personal car), and supervision.\nRecognizing the possibility that the COVID-19 pandemic could result in a health care worker shortage, students may need to be engaged as part of the workforce and embedded in the clinical environment. This situation could change rapidly, and medical schools will need to be nimble and flexible in their response. Some schools are considering early graduation with preparation of fourth-year students to engage as either volunteers or as residents earlier in the clinical environment. The latter may require university flexibility with regard to the conferring of degrees as well as revised processes for licensure.\nConclusions\nWhile in the midst of this COVID-19 crisis, it is crucial that the academic educational community learns from the experience and prioritizes a forward-thinking and scholarly approach as practical solutions are implemented. Reflection and evaluation must follow. For educators, the expression \u201cmake your work count twice\u201d (the first time for the job you are doing and the second to get the work published and disseminated [eg, creating a curriculum that you plan to use for scholarship by publishing it]) and the plan for educational scholarship has never been more imperative. One area in which students can serve and have a positive effect is as educators to their peers, patients, and communities, using the tools available through social media and other modalities to help influence behaviors in a positive way.\nThe COVID-19 epidemic may represent an enduring transformation in medicine with the advancement of telehealth, adaptive research protocols, and clinical trials with flexible approaches to achieve solutions. There are many examples whereby learning from difficult experiences (eg, emergence of HIV, response to disasters) changed discovery, science, and patient care. Students and educators can help document and analyze the effects of current changes to learn and apply new principles and practices to the future. This is not only a time to contribute to the advancement of medical education in the setting of active curricular innovation and transformation, but it may be a seminal moment for many disciplines in medicine.\nBack to top\nArticle Information\nCorresponding Author: Suzanne Rose, MD, MSEd, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, 3400 Civic Center Blvd, Philadelphia, PA 19104 (suzirose@upenn.edu).\nPublished Online: March 31, 2020. doi:10.1001/jama.2020.5227\nConflict of Interest Disclosures: Dr Rose reported receiving honoraria for educational consulting from another medical school and from organizations for speaking on mentoring and leadership and leading a course; receiving royalties for 2 books on topics unrelated to the content of this article; and leading the team at her prior institution to receive an American Medical Association Accelerating Change in Medical Education grant in the second call for proposals for a project related to electronic health record training.\nReferences\n1.\nIrby  DM, Cooke  M, O\u2019Brien  BC.

Public officials from the local health department to the White House are advising people to contact their doctor if they are sick or have questions. Although some people are going directly to EDs, the vast majority of calls and visits are coming to primary care.\nAs COVID-19 spreads across US communities both urban and rural, primary care is the first line of defense to limit the flood of patients to hospitals. Strategies to prevent primary care from being overwhelmed and overrun are urgently needed for 3 reasons. First, primary care teams are intercepting patients of low acuity and diverting them from the ED by fielding questions, triaging patients, and addressing community fears. Second, they are simultaneously treating moderately ill patients, helping them manage symptoms at home and recognize subtle signs of decompensation. As hospitals reach capacity, severely ill patients weaned from ventilators are being discharged home to be managed by community-based primary care and specialty practitioners. Third, primary care physicians (and other outpatient specialists) are stepping in to cover extra hospitalist shifts as inpatient physicians become ill or overwhelmed. If the primary care infrastructure fails,2 much like a collapsing levy, the flood of calls and visits to hospitals and EDs will grow even more overwhelming.\nAs intensive care units (ICUs) become inundated with patients, primary care is also experiencing volume overload. Accordingly, practices are scrambling to keep patients and staff safe, while facing financial collapse.2 In a perfect world, the federal government would mount an organized response to safeguard the integrity of the primary care system. For example, the UK\u2019s National Health Service (NHS) has a national plan for triaging patients. Public information messages instruct everyone in the country with possible symptoms of COVID-19 to avoid visiting their general practitioner or a hospital and to instead call the NHS111 hotline. The hotline operators field questions and provide instructions, thereby reducing the risk of primary care practices becoming swamped or an entire clinic\u2019s workforce being infected.\nLacking a national plan, individual health care systems have taken matters into their own hands. Most have been consumed with equipping hospitals with reliable screening tests, ventilators, and personal protective equipment; some have created centralized call centers, switched to telehealth visits, or designated separate areas to cohort patients and staff. While these efforts are helpful for individual health care systems, they may be insufficient to alleviate pressures on primary care throughout a region. Community practices have been forced to contrive their own solutions, and the tsunami of patient calls being received leaves them no time to pore over the large volume of documents being produced daily by national and local agencies.\nTo supplement the meager national response, regional entities could serve as central conduits to support primary care practices across the region and rapidly facilitate bidirectional dissemination of information. Such a model is needed across the US\u2014and the need is urgent.\nAcademic health centers (AHCs) and other large organizations can leverage their scientific expertise and robust clinical workforce to create this type of primary care extension program, working in close partnership with state and local public health leaders.3,4 Oregon Health & Science University (OHSU) has partnered in this way to implement the centralized COVID-19 Connected Care Center.\nThis model is being implemented in 3 phases.5 In phase I, a hotline was made available statewide to established OHSU patients, allowing for immediate nursing assessment and facilitation of primary care telemedicine visits. Phase II added a provider hotline for primary care practices throughout the state, providing technical assistance with operations, logistics, and clinical questions. The provider hotline is staffed by medical students, residents, and faculty who update and share information with colleagues in real time (or as close to real time as possible, depending on call volume). This hotline mirrors an existing OHSU specialty consult line, which serves the primary care community in rural and frontier counties. Phase III is slated to expand the patient hotline to the 25% of Oregonians without access to primary care6 and patients of small practices that lack the resources of larger health care systems, offering them nursing advice and video visits, if needed.\nA similar statewide resource center could come to the aid of primary care teams in other states, especially states with large and geographically dispersed populations served by independent practices. For states such as Oregon with only 1 large AHC, the state\u2019s AHC could partner with local public health agencies to support statewide efforts to equip primary care practices with real-time answers and a team of clinicians to conduct virtual visits with patients who lack immediate access to primary care. This triage and virtual visit service could also support small primary care practices overwhelmed by volume. These partnerships could rapidly create an extension service, equipping clinicians throughout the state with trusted information that is updated in real time and available via synchronous and asynchronous consults.3 The hotline teams can stay abreast of daily briefings and monitor real-time surveillance data\u2014removing the need for each practice to do their own research and \u201crecreate the same wheel.\u201d An AHC hotline could include health professional (eg, medical, pharmacy, nursing) students, residents, and faculty working remotely.\nSome AHCs may need to serve multiple states (eg, University of Washington\u2019s WWAMI network); others could collaborate to serve segments of states or regions. Many AHCs have spent recent weeks converting outpatient clinics into hospitals and operating rooms into ICUs as well as credentialing, training, and mobilizing their entire physician workforce to provide higher levels of care. They should now help to ensure that all people in the US have access to a hotline and virtual visit, if needed, and that all primary care clinicians have timely access to accurate information. This is what primary care patients deserve and the nation requires to serve the growing number of patients with COVID-19.\nArticle Information\nCorresponding Author: Jennifer E.

Standing 6 feet apart outside a Telluride school gym, they waited for the blood draw that would tell them whether they had mounted an immune response to the disease-causing virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)\u2014a sign that they\u2019d been infected.\nJens Meyer/AP Images\nIn the first such community-wide campaign in the US, the San Miguel County Department of Health offered the voluntary screening to most of the area\u2019s 8000 residents over 2 weeks. Just 8 of the 986 individuals tested on March 26 and 27 were positive for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Another 23 were borderline, suggesting that they\u2019d recently been exposed to the virus and were just starting to make antibodies against it. But those were early days. The screenings, paid for by test manufacturer United Biomedical Inc and the county, eventually would be repeated to see how much things had changed.\nUnlike polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests\u2014also referred to as molecular or nucleic acid\u2013based tests\u2014antibody tests aren\u2019t intended to identify active SARS-CoV-2 infections. Instead of detecting viral genetic material in throat or nasal swabs, antibody tests reveal markers of immune response\u2014the IgM and IgG antibodies that for most people show up in blood more than a week after they start to feel sick, when symptoms may already be waning.\nSerologic antibody tests not only can confirm suspected cases after the fact, they can also reveal who was infected and didn\u2019t know it. Up to a quarter of people with SARS-CoV-2 infection may unwittingly spread the virus because they have mild or no symptoms.\nImplications for the health care workforce could be substantial, microbiologist Florian Krammer, PhD, of Mount Sinai\u2019s Icahn School of Medicine, said in an interview. \u201cIf we find serologically that you are immune, it\u2019s very unlikely that you can get reinfected, which means you can\u2019t pass the virus on to your colleagues or to other patients. And I think it also gives a peace of mind if you have to work with COVID-19 patients to know that you\u2019re probably immune to the infection,\u201d he explained.\nAntibody tests are ramping up quickly, with a growing list of commercial kits and test protocols from academic researchers including Krammer\u2019s team and a Dutch team coming online in recent days and weeks. Scientists said the tests will be critical in the weeks and months ahead, when they may be used for disease surveillance, therapeutics, return-to-work screenings, and more. But the tests must be deployed appropriately, they added, and with an acknowledgment of unanswered questions.\nTurning Antibodies Into Therapies\nIn their first therapeutic application, serology tests are being used to screen donor blood for antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. Plasma containing the antibodies from recovered patients is then transfused to gravely ill patients in an experimental treatment known as convalescent plasma. Early results from a small number of Chinese patients, published in JAMA in late March, were promising.\nThe US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is coordinating a national effort to develop blood-based, antibody-rich COVID-19 therapies. They include convalescent plasma and the hyperimmune globulin derived from it, which ideally will provide passive immunity to people who have been exposed to the virus.\nIn an interview, Carlos Cordon-Cardo, MD, PhD, who chairs the Mount Sinai Health System pathology department in New York City, said physicians there have begun to transfuse convalescent plasma to critically ill patients as part of an FDA expanded access program. Krammer\u2019s research team developed the test that\u2019s being used to screen donor blood.\nThey recently described their new assay in a preprint article (which has not been peer-reviewed). The test detected antibodies in plasma from blood drawn as early as 3 days after patients first developed symptoms. Crucially, it did not react with human coronaviruses already circulating in the population, demonstrating that it\u2019s specific to SARS-CoV-2. \u201cWhat we've found with our test is that basically everybody\u2019s naive,\u201d Krammer said. \u201cThere\u2019s no preexisting immunity. And that makes it very easy to distinguish between people who have been infected and who haven\u2019t been infected.\u201d\nAntibody testing could also help to address a potential unintended consequence of receiving convalescent plasma or hyperimmune globulin. It\u2019s possible that some COVID-19 survivors who undergo these treatments won\u2019t develop their own immunity, putting them at risk for reinfection, Lee Wetzler, MD, a professor of medicine and microbiology at the Boston University School of Medicine, said in an interview. Serologic testing could be used to check their antibody status after they\u2019ve recovered; those with low or no immunity would be prime candidates for a vaccine when one becomes available.\nMount Sinai and United Biomedical\u2019s tests are both enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs), a common laboratory platform that can measure antibody titers. Being able to quantify antibodies will be important for identifying convalescent plasma donors with abundant titers and studying how the immune system responds to the virus. \u201cThe titers that we measure in ELISA seem to correlate with neutralizing antibodies,\u201d Krammer said. \u201cSo basically the idea is the higher these titers, the better you are protected.\u201d\nKrammer has shared his test\u2019s reagents and tool kits with about 150 different US clinical labs. These types of quantitative tests will help scientists to understand if there\u2019s a certain antibody type or threshold a person needs to be protected, according to Wetzler, who is also an infectious disease physician at the Boston Medical Center.\nHowever, a substantial number of the new commercial COVID-19 antibody tests aren\u2019t ELISA-based. They\u2019re lateral flow assays, which provide a simple positive or negative result, with no quantitative information. These kits are cheap and easy to use and, depending on how they\u2019re employed, may be helpful for disease surveillance, Elitza Theel, PhD, director of the Mayo Clinic Infectious Diseases Serology Laboratory in Rochester, Minnesota, said in an interview.\nPalo Alto\u2013based Nirmidas Biotech is one of many companies offering a rapid, point-of-care lateral flow assay. According to Meijie Tang, PhD, the firm\u2019s CEO and president, a state Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) laboratory and other partners are evaluating the test\u2019s performance. \u201cWe plan to collaborate with hospitals, clinics, health care and medical institutions to validate the test and make [it] widely available,\u201d she said in an email.\nDiazyme Laboratories in Poway, California, has developed chemiluminescence immunoassays, which are closer in concept to ELISAs than lateral flow assays. The tests generate a light signal proportional to SARS-CoV-2 IgM antibodies. In an email, cofounder and Managing Director Chong Yuan, PhD, said the company would ship about 2 million tests to clinical labs over the over the next month.\nThe Right Test at the Right Time\nOn April 1, the FDA granted Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) to a rapid SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM lateral flow assay from Cellex Inc in Research Triangle Park, North Carolina. Mount Sinai\u2019s test received EUA 2 weeks later.\nThe agency by early April had also allowed more than 70 companies to sell COVID-19 antibody tests without this authorization, albeit with some stipulations. Among other requirements, manufacturers operating without EUA must state that they\u2019ve clinically validated their tests using specimens from patients with PCR-confirmed infections. The test reports must note that the FDA has not reviewed the assays and that they should not be used as the sole basis to diagnose or exclude SARS-CoV-2 infection or to inform patients of infection status.\nYet, according to Theel, several companies are marketing lateral flow assays as rapid point-of-care tests to identify active COVID-19, something the FDA announced it will take action against. \u201cWe do not really know how well these assays work at this point,\u201d Theel said in a follow-up email.\nAlthough commercial manufacturers claim their tests have high sensitivity and specificity, they haven\u2019t published their data yet. This lack of transparency is worrisome, Theel said: \u201cThe question is, when following symptom onset were these samples collected to show that sensitivity and specificity?\u201d\nHer laboratory has found that most people with SARS-CoV-2 don\u2019t start producing antibodies\u2014or seroconvert\u2014until at least 11 to 12 days after symptom onset. \u201cSo, if we were using these rapid lateral flow assays at the point of care to test recently symptomatic patients,\u2026they are more likely than not going to be negative,\u201d she said.\nGreater FDA oversight for antibody tests could be coming, according to news reports. In addition, the World Health Organization (WHO) is working with partners and its own global laboratory network to evaluate available assays for diagnostic and research purposes, a spokesperson said in an email. One partner in the effort is the Foundation for Innovating Diagnostics (FIND), a Geneva, Switzerland\u2013headquartered nonprofit that\u2019s evaluating both PCR and serology tests. As of mid-April, the group had selected 27 antibody tests, mostly from China, for its first round of evaluation. The tests\u2019 performance results will be posted on the FIND website as they become available.\nAccording to news reports, newly available rapid, point-of-care PCR tests, like a recently announced 5-minute assay from Abbott Laboratories, won\u2019t substantially increase diagnostic testing capacity in the short-term. Faced with a PCR test shortfall amid incredible demand, health systems may consider subbing in serology tests. But experts strongly underscored that antibody testing generally should not be used to diagnose active cases.\nKrammer said that resorting to antibody testing to diagnose active infections is a \u201ccomplete misuse.\u201d Not only are antibody tests likely to report false-negatives early on, they\u2019ll also miss infections among people who are immunocompromised and don\u2019t produce antibodies.\n\u201cMolecular testing is still going to be the go-to preferred method for diagnosis of COVID-19 in symptomatic patients,\u201d Theel said. In her view, the only appropriate use of antibody testing for active infection may be for people who have had symptoms for over a week but are PCR negative. But the precise timing of that still hasn\u2019t been defined.\n\u201cI think that it is very important that we understand the limitations of serologic testing, recognizing that it takes time to mount a detectable immune response, and to use them for the right reasons,\u201d Theel said. \u201cA false-negative serologic result in an acutely symptomatic patient with replicating and shedding virus has serious public health consequences.\u201d\nBack to Work\nSan Miguel County\u2019s public health department has said it will use its test results to detect and contain COVID-19 in the community and provide a clearer picture of the disease\u2019s prevalence there. Other areas may soon follow suit: United Biomedical cofounder and Telluride resident Mei Mei Hu said in an email that screenings in additional communities are being planned.\nGovernment officials and health systems need accurate infection counts to understand COVID-19\u2019s spread, conduct contact tracing, craft public health recommendations, and prepare for health care surges. When the dust has settled, epidemiologists will use widespread serosurveillance data to more accurately estimate just how many people who contracted the virus became seriously ill or died.\nTo that end, a National Institutes of Health\u2013funded antibody survey is enrolling 10\u202f000 volunteers from around the country and, according to news reports, nationally representative, CDC-funded serosurveys are slated to begin later this year. Meanwhile, the WHO is providing countries with an early protocol and technical support for seroepidemiological studies and is launching a multicountry antibody testing study called SOLIDARITY II.\nCrucially, many believe that antibody testing can also be used to return people with immunity to the workforce or keep them there, starting with health care professionals and emergency first responders. Krammer suggested that staffing nursing homes with immune workers could bring down their high case-fatality rates, for example.\n\u201c[S]erosurveillance is going to play a major role in\u2026a framework for getting back to normal,\u201d Anthony Fauci, MD, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and a White House Coronavirus Task Force advisor, said in an April 8 JAMA\ufeff livestream. Two prominent COVID-19 roadmaps\u2014one from former FDA Director Scott Gottlieb, MD, and the other from the University of Pennsylvania\u2019s Ezekiel Emanuel, MD\u2014include widespread antibody testing as a critical step toward reopening society.\n\u201cI think it makes total sense that if immunity is increasing and we have, let\u2019s say, 50% of people immune against this, then we have a much less chance that the virus will spread,\u201d said Melanie Ott, MD, PhD, a senior investigator at the Gladstone Institute of Virology and Immunology in San Francisco. \u201cAt a certain point, we will be able to minimize that risk with potentially minimal additional measures that have to be taken.\u201d\nAlong those lines, media outlets have reported that researchers in Germany and Italy will conduct and study large-scale antibody testing, with Germany planning to issue \u201cimmunity certificates\u201d to transition its citizens out of lockdown. Public Health England, which provides evidence-based support to the National Health Service, recently discussed plans for nationwide antibody screening that would begin once a rapid, at-home finger-prick test under consideration was assessed for accuracy. At press time, the White House hadn\u2019t announced similar plans.\nAllowing people to reenter society based on their antibody status assumes that past infection guards against reinfection, something that researchers said was likely but not yet well defined. \u201cHow broad and how long and how effective this immune response is is still not clear,\u201d Ott said.\nScientists around the world will be working to understand what sort of protection infection bestows, both in the laboratory and by following up recovered patients to see if reinfections occur. So far, the novel coronavirus doesn\u2019t appear to mutate quickly. This, coupled with experience with other viral infections, suggests that people with SARS-CoV-2 antibodies may be protected at least for some time, Wetzler said.\nThere\u2019s another potential snag, however. Individuals can be PCR positive even after antibodies develop. \u201cThe question is, is that live virus that we\u2019re detecting? Is it replicating? And is it transmissible? And I think that\u2019s still an unknown at this point,\u201d Theel said. Coupling a positive antibody test with a negative PCR result could reduce the chance that people who are still contagious reenter society.\nUltimately, a positive antibody test could be a sort of get-out-of-isolation card. \u201cIn the long run, I think it would be nice to provide this for the whole population because everybody who is immune could basically go back to normal life because they can\u2019t infect anybody else,\u201d Krammer said.\nFor now, he cautioned that novel coronavirus infections are probably not yet widespread among the general population in the US, which is just in the \u201cbeginning of a large epidemic.\u201d But as more people become infected and immune, they could help jumpstart the economy by going back to work. They could also provide practical support for those who are vulnerable to serious infection, potentially until a vaccine arrives.\nIn early April, Cordon-Cardo said Mount Sinai would likely expand its assay\u2019s use beyond experimental therapeutics to testing health care workers. And at the Mayo Clinic, clinical antibody testing began in mid-April. If these applications are followed by a rollout of widespread antibody testing for the general public, they could lead to a gradual reopening of society to a world changed by COVID-19.", "jamacardio.2020.0934": "T\nhe outbreak of novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which emerged in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, has rapidly spread to more than 58 countries and areas.1 As of March 1, 2020, about 79\u202f968 cases in mainland China have been confirmed and 2873 deaths have occurred.1 The Chinese government is mustering medical personnel around the country to treat patients in Hubei province and preventing further spread of COVID-19 in every region of the country.\nAt the same time, several studies concerning the epidemiological and clinical features of COVID-19 have been published in a timely manner, which has greatly helped health care workers and policy makers to understand COVID-19. Reading these reports, we noticed that many patients with COVID-19 had comorbid chronic cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), which collectively represent the most common noncommunicable epidemic in China currently. Among 44\u202f672 individuals confirmed to have COVID-19 as of February 11, 2020, 2683 patients (12.8%) had hypertension and 873 (4.2%) had CVDs,2 which were the most common coexisting conditions in patients hospitalized with COVID-19.3,4 Furthermore, patients with comorbid CVDs were more likely to have severe illness associated with COVID-19 and had a much higher fatality rate: 10.5% for those with CVDs and 6.0% for hypertension, while the fatality rate was 0.9% in patients who reported no comorbid conditions.2 This information indicated that individuals with underlying chronic CVDs were both more susceptible to COVID-19 and more prone to critical conditions and death. It is well known that acute pulmonary infection can potentially destabilize cardiac diseases, such as heart failure and coronary artery disease. Then deterioration of cardiac diseases would exacerbate COVID-19 management in turn.\nHowever, inadequate attention has been paid to comorbid CVDs in patients with COVID-19. Hitherto, to our knowledge, academic reports regarding clinical features of COVID-19 did not classify cardiovascular disorders clearly. For instance, the number of patients with specific cardiovascular diseases, including ischemic heart disease, heart failure, cardiac arrhythmia, and other conditions, were not provided. In addition, hypertension was reported independently of CVDs, even though it is clearly a CVD. It is possible that these CVDs have varying associations with COVID-19 prognosis.\nDyspnea and fatigue, 2 cardinal symptoms of heart failure, are very common in patients with COVID-19, particularly in its severe stages.4,5 Hence, the diagnosis of COVID-19 is made more difficult in patients with chronic heart failure. Also, both COVID-19 and heart failure give rise to hypoxemia, which is the basic pathophysiological mechanism leading to death.5 Additionally, the systemic inflammatory response in COVID-19 may trigger rupture or erosion of coronary plaques in patients with underlying coronary artery disease. Patients with active COVID-19 can hardly survive a myocardial infarction. Moreover, hypoxemia caused by COVID-19 may bring about atrial fibrillation, which is the most common arrhythmia among elderly individuals, and atrial fibrillation could be refractory before the pulmonary function is improved. The systemic inflammatory response would make the anticoagulation therapy for atrial fibrillation very complex.\nCurrently, there have been only scarce data with respect to cardiovascular complications of COVID-19. A recent study presented by Wang et al3 showed that acute cardiac injury, defined as troponin I elevation or new abnormalities detected with electrocardiography and echocardiography, was found in 10 patients (7.2%) with COVID-19. In addition, arrhythmia was found in 23 patients (16.7%). However, they did not provide clear classification of arrhythmia and echocardiographic parameters. Notably, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), which caused a global epidemic in 2003, is recognized as a sister to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 that causes COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2).6 Therefore, it is possible that these 2 viruses have similar effects on the heart. Yu et al7 reported that tachycardia was present in 71.9% of patients with SARS, and bradycardia occurred in 14.9% as a transient event. It is thus possible that tachycardia might be a common arrhythmia in patients with COVID-19.\nIn addition, acute cardiac injury was found in 5 patients (14%) with COVID-19 in another study.4 The cardiac injury may result from viral infection, hypoxemia, and deterioration of underlying cardiac diseases. Reports concerning myocarditis in humans by coronavirus are very rare. At present, to our knowledge, the sole pathological investigation8 involved biopsy samples at autopsy of a patient who died of COVID-19, which showed a few mononuclear inflammatory infiltrates in the myocardial interstitium, without substantial damage in the heart tissue. This finding suggests that the SARS-CoV-2 virus might cause myocarditis. In a study of 46 patients with SARS, Li et al9 found subclinical diastolic impairment, which may be reversible on clinical recovery, but there was no interstitial lymphocytic infiltrate or myocyte necrosis in the heart of a patient with the lowest left ventricular ejection fraction.9 It was postulated that the temporary diastolic impairment detected by echocardiography might be attributable to systemic inflammatory storm resulting from an overaggressive host immune response to viral infection, given that several studies suggested several cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor and the interleukin-6 family, have clinically significant negative inotropic influence. Further detection by whole-genome sequencing, direct polymerase chain reaction, and culture with biopsy samples may help to identify whether SARS-CoV-2 is present in myocardium. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging may be helpful to detect cardiac injury noninvasively.\nOf note, several investigations have demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV share the same host receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2),6 which may have many protective effects on CVDs.10 A recent study revealed that affinity of SARS-CoV-2 binding to ACE2 was 10-fold to 20-fold higher than that of SARS-CoV,6 which suggests SARS-CoV-2 could spread from human to human easily. Therefore, ACE2 may play 2 contrary roles in patients with COVID-19, especially those with comorbid CVDs. On the one hand, ACE2 may provide protection against hypertension, myocardial fibrosis, myocardial hypertrophy, arrhythmia, atherosclerosis, and sodium-water retention.10 On the other hand, ACE2 acts as the gate for SARS-CoV-2 infection.6 Previous studies have shown that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) could upregulate the expression or prevent the loss of ACE2, which is one of the mechanisms of ACEI/ARB activity.10 At this point in our knowledge, it is conceivable that ACEI/ARB therapy might increase the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, experimental evidence indicates that the ARB losartan and recombinant human ACE2 can protect mice from severe acute lung injury induced by acid aspiration or sepsis. Considering that ACEI/ARB therapy is widely prescribed to patients with hypertension, heart failure, and ischemia heart disease, additional attention should be paid to patients with COVID-19 and close contacts who are using ACEI/ARB therapy.\nTo date, many patients with COVID-19 are still hospitalized in China and other countries, such Italy and Iran. Therefore, continued observations of the cardiovascular complications of the disease are needed. In addition, further assessment is needed to identify risk factors for poor prognosis.\nEmerging as an acute infectious disease, COVID-19 may become a chronic epidemic similar to influenza because of genetic recombination. Therefore, we should be ready for the reemergence of COVID-19 or other coronaviruses. Considering that CVDs represent the leading noncommunicable epidemic around the world and numerous patients with CVDs are using ACEI/ARB, clinical studies may be necessary to explore the potential associations of ACEI/ARB with susceptibility and prognosis of COVID-19.\nBack to top\nArticle Information\nCorresponding Authors: Zening Jin, MD, PhD (jin_zening@163.com), and Chengzhi Yang, MD, PhD (yangcz@hsc.pku.edu.cn), Department of Cardiology and Macrovascular Disease, Beijing Tiantan Hospital, No. 119 South Fourth Ring West Rd, Beijing 100070, China.\nPublished Online: March 25, 2020. doi:10.1001/jamacardio.2020.0934\nConflict of Interest Disclosures: None reported.\nFunding/Support: This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (grant 81900452).\nRole of the Funder/Sponsor: The funder had no role in the preparation, review, or approval of the manuscript and decision to submit the manuscript for publication.\nReferences\n1.\nWorld Health Organization.

Balanced crystalloids are preferred over unbalanced crystalloids (weak recommendation, moderate QE).\nFor adults with shock, the following are suggested: using norepinephrine as the first-line vasoactive (weak recommendation, LQE), use of either vasopressin or epinephrine as the first line if norepinephrine is not available (weak recommendation, LQE). Dopamine is not recommended if norepinephrine is not available (strong recommendation, high QE). Adding vasopressin as a second-line agent is suggested if the target (60-65 mm Hg) mean arterial pressure cannot be achieved by norepinephrine alone (weak recommendation, moderate QE).\nVentilatory Support\nStarting supplemental oxygen is recommended if the Spo2 is less than 90% (strong recommendation, moderate QE). Spo2 should be maintained no higher than 96% (strong recommendation, moderate QE).\nFor acute hypoxemic respiratory failure despite conventional oxygen therapy, use of high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) is suggested relative to conventional oxygen therapy and noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) (weak recommendation, LQE). If HFNC is not available, a trial of NIPPV is suggested (weak recommendation, very LQE). Close monitoring for worsening of respiratory status and early intubation if worsening occurs is recommended (best practice statement).\nFor adults receiving mechanical ventilation who have acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), use of low tidal volume ventilation (4-8 mL/kg of predicted body weight) is recommended and preferred over higher tidal volumes (>8 mL/kg) (strong recommendation, moderate QE). Targeting plateau pressures of <30 cm H2O (strong recommendation, moderate QE) is recommended. Using a higher positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) strategy over lower PEEP strategy is suggested (weak recommendation, LQE).\nFor adults receiving mechanical ventilation who have moderate to severe ARDS, prone ventilation for 12 to 16 hours is suggested over no prone ventilation (weak recommendation, LQE). Using as-needed neuromuscular blocking agents (NMBAs) instead of continuous NMBA infusion to facilitate protective lung ventilation is suggested (weak recommendation, LQE).\nFor adults receiving mechanical ventilation who have severe ARDS and hypoxemia despite optimizing ventilation, a trial of inhaled pulmonary vasodilator is suggested. If no rapid improvement in oxygenation is observed, the treatment should be tapered (weak recommendation, very LQE). The use of lung recruitment maneuvers (intended to open otherwise closed lung segments, such as 40 cm H2O inspiratory hold for 40 seconds) is suggested, over not using recruitment maneuvers (weak recommendation, LQE), but using staircase (incremental PEEP) recruitment maneuvers is not recommended (strong recommendation, moderate QE). Use of veno-venous circulation for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) or referral to an ECMO center is suggested, if available, for selected patients (weak recommendation, LQE).\nTherapy\nIn adults receiving mechanical ventilation who do not have ARDS, routine use of systematic corticosteroids is suggested against (weak recommendation, LQE). In those with ARDS, use of corticosteroids is suggested (weak recommendation, LQE).\nIn COVID-19 patients receiving mechanical ventilation who have respiratory failure, use of empiric antimicrobial/antibacterial agents is suggested (no evidence rating); assess for deescalation.\nIn critically ill adults with fever, use of pharmacologic agents for temperature control is suggested over nonpharmacologic agents or no treatment. Routine use of standard IV immunoglobulins is not suggested. Convalescent plasma is not suggested. There is insufficient evidence to issue a recommendation on use of any of the following: antiviral agents, recombinant interferons, chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine, or tocilizumab.\nSummary of the Clinical Problem\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the cause of COVID-19, a pandemic that has affected more than 400\u202f000 individuals and caused nearly 20\u202f000 deaths as of late March 2020. Approximately 5% to 10% of patients require intensive care unit (ICU) admission and mechanical ventilation.1\nCharacteristics of the Guideline Source\nThe Surviving Sepsis Campaign (SSC) has previously published a series of guidelines for sepsis and septic shock. Based on this experience, experts were recruited to write guidelines on the management of COVID-19 in critically ill adults. These guidelines were authored by 36 experts from 12 countries (Table).2 Recommendations were developed based on limited direct evidence with COVID-19 cases and indirect evidence derived from previous pandemics such as Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), and other coronavirus infections. Overall, the panel issued 54 statements: 4 best practice statements, 9 strong recommendations, and 35 weak recommendations. (No recommendations were made for the remaining 6 topics.)\nEvidence Base\nThe GRADE method was used, with the actionable guideline questions placed in population, intervention, comparator, outcomes (PICO) format. The first discusses PPE to protect health care workers and prevent nosocomial spread of virus. A recent clinical trial of 2862 health care personnel at 137 outpatient sites compared the use of N95 respirators vs medical masks and found no significant difference in the incidence of laboratory-confirmed influenza (8.2% vs 7.2% health care personnel seasons; difference, 1.0% [95% CI, \u22120.5% to 2.5%]; P\u2009=\u2009.18) (adjusted odds ratio, 1.18 [95% CI, 0.95-1.45]).3 The CDC recently discussed strategies for optimizing the supply of face masks.\nCritically ill patients with COVID-19 often develop septic (distributive) shock. Fluid resuscitation guided by dynamic assessment of fluid responsiveness is recommended based on a reduction in mortality (risk ratio, 0.59 [95% CI, 0.42-0.83]; P\u2009=\u2009.002) in a meta-analysis of 1652 patients in 13 trials.4 These dynamic measures facilitate a more judicious, rather than liberal, fluid strategy both during and after initial resuscitation.5\nBenefits and Harms\nThe panel issued a suggestion against the routine use of systematic corticosteroids for respiratory failure without ARDS in COVID-19, but issued a suggestion for use in patients with ARDS. One retrospective, non\u2013peer-reviewed report of 46 patients6 suggested treatment with methylprednisolone, 1 to 2 mg/kg/d for 5 to 7 days, was associated with a reduction in duration of fever and the need for supplemental oxygen. The panel also drew on indirect evidence of corticosteroid use in community-acquired pneumonia, ARDS, and other viral infections, using a Cochrane review7 on the use of steroids in viral pneumonia, updated to include 15 cohort studies on influenza and 10 on coronaviruses. This analysis found an association between corticosteroid use and increased mortality (odds ratio, 2.76 [95% CI, 2.06-3.69]), although the association among patients with coronaviruses was unclear (odds ratio, 0.83 [95% CI, 0.32-2.17]).\nThe guideline recommendations for management of respiratory failure highlight the competing goals unique to the COVID-19 pandemic. A recommendation for the use of HFNC oxygen therapy is based on findings from a clinical trial that showed a benefit relative to standard oxygen and NIPPV in progression to intubation.8 The panel also recommended a trial of NIPPV if HFNC is unavailable or ineffective. Following these recommendations may prevent intubation and the need for ventilator support, a scarce resource when there are large numbers of COVID-19 cases. However, HFNC and NIPPV may also aerosolize respiratory droplets, which will increase the need for negative-pressure rooms and N95 or FFP2 masks, which are also a scarce resource.\nDiscussion\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has brought unprecedented challenges regarding the ability to generate timely evidence, even as the disease overwhelms health care systems and stresses the clinical workforce. This SSC guideline2 will be frequently updated online as global evidence accrues, but it reflects the central tenants of best practices for ARDS: low tidal volume strategy, PEEP titration, avoidance of hyperoxia, and a conservative fluid strategy.\nAreas in Need of Future Study or Ongoing Research\nMany of these recommendations are extrapolated from studies and experience in critically ill patients without COVID-19. However, this pandemic has necessitated flexibility and ingenuity to address its unique challenges, and it will require continued rapid and judicious synthesis of heterogeneous and rapidly evolving data and clinical experience shared by clinicians.\nFor instance, concern for aerosolization with HFNC and NIPPV and a critical shortage of mechanical ventilators have led to consideration of helmet NIPPV as an alternative in centers with this resource. Additionally, a small single-center clinical trial (n\u2009=\u200983 patients) has suggested decreased intubation and mortality with use of helmet NIPPV compared with face mask.9 Unfortunately, these investigations used a ventilator to deliver helmet NIPPV. If the intent is to spare patients from invasive mechanical ventilation while limiting exposure to health care workers, helmet NIPPV using a ventilator may be an option. Alternatively, if mechanical ventilators are in short supply, it is possible to deliver helmet NIPPV using a flow generator (\u226560 L/min) to deliver oxygen and an expiratory pressure valve to maintain PEEP. The guideline panel noted the option of helmet NIPPV but was not able to make a recommendation, noting uncertainty about its safety and efficacy in COVID-19.

One stark example is the debate over whether to prescribe available therapies, such as quinine-based antimalarial drugs (eg, chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine), or test these drugs in randomized clinical trials (RCTs). At the heart of the problem is one of the oldest dilemmas in human organizations: the \u201cexploitation-exploration\u201d trade-off.1 Exploitation refers to acting on current knowledge, habits, or beliefs despite uncertainty. This is the \u201cjust do it\u201d option: give various therapies (eg, chloroquine) to affected patients based on current knowledge or a hunch. Exploration refers to actions taken to generate new knowledge and reduce uncertainty, eg, testing therapies in an RCT. This is the \u201cmust learn\u201d option.\nCurrently, these approaches are framed as a choice: do something (treat the patient) or learn something (test the drug). This dilemma is now playing out across the world, with many clinicians recommending treatments (eg, antiviral agents or immunomodulating drugs), even while researchers and regulators emphasize that evidence is limited and the need for RCTs is paramount. The problem is that exploitation/exploration trade-offs are almost always best solved by a strategy that blends both: simultaneously learning while doing. The joint goal of this integrated effort is to maximize short-term outcomes (eg, the best possible recovery of patients who must be treated now) and long-term outcomes (eg, the fastest path to discovery and dissemination of new treatments). This balance is elusive, and potentially impossible without an integrated approach\u2014a single system that \u201clearns while doing,\u201d with alacrity.\nHowever, medicine is organized to do each task separately: clinical practice (doing) and clinical research (learning) are addressed by separate institutions, procedures, and funding. Hospitals and physician groups practice medicine while academic institutions, entities like the National Institutes of Health, and pharmaceutical companies focus on scientific discovery. There are many reasons for this division of labor, not the least of which was the Belmont Report, which codified that research should be kept separate from the practice of medicine, or patients\u2019 interests will be usurped.2 There are, however, huge costs to this division, including delays in knowledge acquisition and dissemination. In normal times, these costs are somewhat suppressed or ignored, but in a crisis such as the COVID-19 pandemic, they come into sharp focus. Thus, as pressure mounts to \u201cjust do something,\u201d the challenge to learn simultaneously and efficiently becomes increasingly difficult, placing both individuals and society in peril.\nThree Major Challenges to Learning While Doing\nThe chief tool in the learning toolkit is the RCT, primarily because randomization is such a powerful mechanism for inferring causal effects. It is not perfect, and there are alternatives, but in the absence of a miracle drug that dramatically eradicates the disease, randomization will be crucial to determine what therapies work. There are, however, 3 major challenges.\nRandomization is profoundly uncomfortable. Kalil has suggested that a clinician who wishes to administer chloroquine (rather than defer to randomized assignment) may not necessarily serve the patient\u2019s best interest (eg, by administering an intervention that is in fact harmful) and squanders an opportunity to learn.3 This argument is correct. However, it ignores that many clinicians, policy makers, and health care administrators will experience profound discomfort and distress, especially while trying to manage a pandemic. Even if a physician agrees that the evidence is uncertain, if they believe that the chance of benefit outweighs the chance of harm, they will feel compelled to \u201cjust do it.\u201d The consequences for the patient, for whom the physician feels responsible, are salient and immediate. In contrast, the benefits of accelerated learning through participation in the trial, as well as the consequences of delayed knowledge generation through failure to participate, feel abstract, remote, difficult to calibrate, and beyond the physician\u2019s responsibility.\nThe deployment of an RCT is too cumbersome. Because the clinical research apparatus is executed by a process parallel to care delivery, there is no easy way to inculcate randomization at the point that clinical decisions are being made. The trial has to be designed, funded, and approved. All operational aspects have to be custom built and implemented. Even when the trial is live, the activities required to convert from \u201cjust order chloroquine\u201d to \u201crandomize to chloroquine or placebo\u201d include many steps that intrude on clinical operations, distract from other critical clinical actions, and require research staff who may be furloughed in an epidemic. Meanwhile, thousands of patients are treated outside any RCT, and time to learn is lost.\nThose who would fund or conduct RCTs cannot present a unified plan. Although well-motivated, the entire clinical trial enterprise\u2014investigators, drug companies, and funding agencies\u2014is currently in worldwide chaos. Hundreds of COVID-19 trials have been registered on ClinicalTrials.gov, intending to test a wide array of interventions. Clinicians and hospitals are bombarded with requests to participate. Pharmaceutical trials are moving quickly, but in competition with each other. Funding agencies are articulating varying views on priorities and processes. Everywhere, those who would design and conduct trials are competing for funds and priority review. Already, there has been intense clashing of competing ideas around which approaches are appropriate, which therapies should be tested, and other pressing issues. This threat is global, but most efforts are regional and national, with little international cooperation. In the midst of this chaos, it is difficult to imagine any coordinated integrated relationship between the clinical research and clinical practice enterprises. The effort required is simply immense.\nPotential Solutions From the Clinical Research Enterprise\nThe goal must be a system that has a more integrated approach to learning while doing. Currently, those who are doing are increasingly becoming overwhelmed. The first onus, therefore, should be on the research community to \u201clean in\u201d toward the clinical practice community. Practically speaking, that can include several steps.\nPromote designs that make randomization more comfortable. The desire to do something is real and valid. Against that backdrop, RCTs that assign half of the patients to a control group with no active agent intended to mitigate COVID-19 and offer no near-term reward such as new information on treatment effectiveness are asking a lot of clinicians\u2014but designs that simultaneously randomize to several treatment options lower the proportion of individuals assigned to control care. Trials that adapt to quickly discontinue poorly performing therapies may also be reassuring, as clinicians will know that an assigned \u201crecipe\u201d will be increasingly likely to be superior as knowledge accrues. International, large-scale, high-enrolling RCTs could conceivably adapt as frequently as weekly.\nPromote designs that facilitate \u201c1-stop shopping\u201d at the point of care for the evaluation of different therapies. There is not time, either during the review process or at the bedside, to be weighing the pros and cons of multiple competing trials. It would be far more efficient to use designs that leverage a common platform for trial entry, data collection, and testing of multiple therapies.\nConsider sacrificing sacred cows of clinical research. In a rapidly changing pandemic, perfection will be the enemy of the good. For example, the use of placebo in a control group can increase trial rigor, but it is not necessarily crucial and will add logistical burden, hampering study design (challenging to have multiple intervention groups with multiple placebos), launch (difficult to produce placebo instantly), and execution (more complex dispensary logistics). A good trial, even if not perfect, is better than no trial.\nCast a big (international) tent. None of the above will happen without leadership and commitment to create an integrated environment with incentives to work together. Funding agencies responsible to taxpayers need the political cover and authority to support international studies; pharmaceutical companies need support and incentives from regulatory authorities to participate in collaborative trials; and academic investigators need a structure that provides academic credit and incentive to collaborate in efforts where they might otherwise perceive anonymity and loss of control.\nPotential Solutions From the Clinical Practice Enterprise\nHealth care systems can help implement study logistics within clinical information systems. Health care, especially in the US, largely runs on electronic health record (EHR) systems. These systems can facilitate many aspects of clinical research. However, because there is no common platform or cross-system interoperability, there is limited ability for researchers to integrate smoothly with local system EHRs without the cooperation of hospital information technology staff. If hospitals could nonetheless prioritize integration, several research tasks (eg, screening, enrollment, treatment assignment, data collection) could be facilitated.\nPhysicians can engage in self-reflection and seek consensus around equipoise. Physicians often hold highly divergent views on whether to give, withhold, or test any particular therapy. Even if there is equipoise on average, if that average is because half the physicians believe a therapy works and the other half believe it will be harmful, then it will be difficult to conduct a trial. Now is a valuable time to reflect on how much uncertainty exists around different therapies and the value of reducing that uncertainty. A hospital that unites around its commitment to generate knowledge as fast as possible regarding a suite of potential therapies will be far more ready to collaborate with the clinical research enterprise.\nPhysicians can have an active role in discussions with patients. COVID-19 is a new disease. Thus, essentially any therapy prescribed in its treatment is experimental. It is crucial, therefore, that patients participate fully in a process of informed consent. Physicians\u2019 roles can include actively referring patients, answering patients\u2019 questions when appropriate, or joining the research team as local investigators. Each physician has an important responsibility to be informed, think clearly, and communicate wisely.\nConclusions\nThere is a need to do (treat patients) and learn (test therapies) at the same time\u2014they are intertwined endeavors. However, these approaches have been disaggregated and assigned to 2 disparate enterprises. Each enterprise must make changes to lean in to the other. All of society is profoundly affected by social distancing protocols. If the problem of learning while doing cannot be solved, the period until effective treatments are discovered and implemented will be prolonged, in turn prolonging the period that society must endure these blunt public health measures. This is not a problem for researchers alone: it is incumbent on the public, private companies, public officials, health care centers, clinicians, and the research community to solve. The world faced a similar epidemic in 1919, and millions died. Now facing another, it is useful to reflect that physicians tried to treat the Spanish flu with quinine. A century later, it is shocking to still be asking the same question about the same drugs. An integrated approach of learning while doing is essential.\nBack to top\nArticle Information\nCorresponding Author: Derek C.

Such policies have been discussed, but not implemented, in the US. However, if other countries require these certifications for entrance, the US may adopt them to enable travel, generating calls to use them more broadly.\nCertifications of immunity are sometimes called \u201cimmunity passports\u201d but are better conceptualized as immunity-based licenses. Such policies raise important questions about fairness, stigma, and counterproductive incentives but could also further individual freedom and improve public health.\nImmunity licenses should not be evaluated against a baseline of normalcy, ie, uninfected free movement. Rather, they should be compared to the alternatives of enforcing strict public health restrictions for many months or permitting activities that could spread infection, both of which exacerbate inequalities and impose serious burdens. This Viewpoint presents a framework for analyzing the ethics of immunity licenses.\nLiberty, Immunity-Based Licenses, and the Least Restrictive Alternative\nThe ethical values of liberty and autonomy support a presumption that policies should consider immunity to COVID-19 (eTable 1 in the Supplement). This may seem counterintuitive because people who are not immune may have their liberty limited if they hold certain jobs or travel to certain places that require a license. However, public health is committed to protecting liberty and autonomy through the principle of the \u201cleast restrictive alternative,\u201d1 which proscribes measures more restrictive than necessary to achieve public health objectives. In other words, people must be allowed to pursue their life plans unless doing so is incompatible with public health.\nThe least restrictive alternative principle supports using COVID-19 immunity licenses if available. Current liberty-limiting restrictions on gatherings, work, and travel are justified because infected people may be harmed or die and may harm others by spreading disease or overburdening hospitals. But they are not justified when applied to people at little or no risk of infection. The principle of the least restrictive alternative supports giving people a chance to show that they are immune.\nHow might individuals be given the opportunity to demonstrate immunity? Driver\u2019s and pilot\u2019s licenses and similar policies suggest a way forward. Rather than banning risky activities, licensing permits people to participate in these activities but only after evidence of safety, such as through competency tests, has been demonstrated. The same could be true for immunity and risky activities during the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe term \u201cimmunity-based licenses\u201d is better than \u201cimmunity passports.\u201d Passports suggest an all-or-nothing permission and endorse categorical denial of access to an entire country. In contrast, licensing requirements are more stringent for drivers of school buses or airplane pilots than for drivers of cars, and are more restrictive for younger drivers or those with conditions that may impair driving. Importantly, these restrictions are ethical and legal even when a person\u2019s higher risk or inability to pass a test is outside their control, as with drivers who are visually impaired or have epilepsy. By analogy, in the setting of COVID-19, immunity-based licenses could apply to specific, high-risk activities, such as working in a nursing home, and could permit exceptions and gradations.\nThe ethical case for immunity-based licenses can be buttressed by working to ensure that licenses do not exacerbate inequality. Driver\u2019s license fees unfairly burden lower-income individuals, and transportation for those unable to drive is often inadequate. In contrast, ethically sound immunity licensing policies would reject license fees and would ensure that unlicensed people are not subject to social or economic exclusion, \u201cbanned from entering grocery stores, using public services, or traveling,\u201d or \u201cconfined to their homes for an indefinite period of time.\u201d2 Activities currently permitted under public health orders, like walking outdoors, driving, interacting with household members, and shopping or working remotely or at businesses like grocery stores, should not require immunity licenses. The list of activities that require licenses should change in response to public health needs, as the least restrictive alternative principle requires.\nImmunity-Based Licenses and Ethical Values\nThe ethics of COVID-19 immunity licenses can be assessed with respect to 3 fundamental ethical values: the maximization of benefit; priority to the least advantaged; and treating people equally (eTable 1 in the Supplement).3 These values can be consistent with a well-designed implementation of immunity licenses.\nFirst, immunity licenses could maximize benefits by safely enabling patronage of bars and restaurants and in-person attendance of cultural, worship, and sporting events. Permitting these activities without risking infection would increase tax revenues, which could be earmarked to fund COVID-19 response, and reduce social harms caused by unemployment and isolation.\nSecond, immunity licenses can be consistent with priority to the least advantaged, that is, people who are medically, socially, or economically vulnerable. Under strict public health restrictions, no one would be able to perform in-person social and economic activities. Conversely, if some activities are made conditional on licensure, only people who lack immunity licenses may be disadvantaged in comparison to others. Generally, society avoids policies that \u201clevel down\u201d: bringing every person down to the least advantaged position does not solve the problem of disadvantage.4 Meanwhile, although workers with immunity licenses might receive offers so lucrative they would be difficult to refuse, generous offers are not coercive.5 Further, all workers, including the immune, would retain legal protections against being coerced to work.\nMore important, just as the work of licensed truckers benefits those unable to drive, the increased safety and economic activity enabled by immunity licenses would benefit the unlicensed. For instance, preferentially hiring immune individuals in nursing homes or as home health workers could reduce the spread of the virus in those facilities and better protect the people most vulnerable to COVID-19. Friends, relatives, and clergy who are immune could visit patients in hospitals and nursing homes.\nA third consideration, indeed a major concern, is that immunity licensing might seem to stigmatize people, undermining the value of equal treatment. Are immunity-based licenses like the yellow stars Nazis forced Jews to wear? Will they \u201csplit communities in two\u201d2 and stigmatize those without immunity? The yellow star and similar forms of invidious discrimination divided people based on race, religion, or heritage: all factors that should be irrelevant to social participation. In contrast, vulnerability to COVID-19 is a factor that public health policy already legitimately considers. Any inequalities produced by immunity licenses would not be invidious and would serve the interests of public health and of the disadvantaged. Importantly, refusing to create a regulated licensing program will not avoid stigma and inequality. In the absence of licensing, businesses and individuals may instead elect to use unregulated evidence of immunity, such as test results, or to use assumptions about immunity or vulnerability that are likely to be arbitrary and biased.\nPractical Challenges in Implementation\nCOVID-19 immunity licenses can be ethical in principle but in practice depend on 4 important questions related to both the actual evidence and effective implementation (eTable 2 in the Supplement). First, serology tests used to determine whether someone has had COVID-19 for licensing purposes must be valid and reliable, with high specificity and sensitivity. This requires a governmental body, such as the FDA, to establish and impose valid, evidence-based certification procedures. Immunity-based licenses can only be introduced if serology testing is accurate. In addition, depending on rigorous evidence regarding the duration of immunity, periodic testing and renewal of immunity licenses at designated intervals based on specific criteria may be necessary, similar to the renewal process for driver\u2019s licenses.\nSecond, immunity-based licensing requires evidence that a positive serology test result indicates immunity. Otherwise, licenses could cause more harm than good by creating a false sense of immunity and facilitating spread. As research into immunity progresses, a guiding principle will be that no certification or test is perfect. Some licensed drivers drive dangerously and some unlicensed ones drive safely, but licensing improves overall safety. A similar trend would likely exist for immunity licenses.\nThird, in the absence of a vaccine, the benefits of licenses might encourage uninfected people to relax protective measures or actively seek infection. This is analogous to parents organizing parties to intentionally infect their children with varicella, despite the potential for the very small risk of brain damage or death from infection. Although this incentive exists to some extent even without licensing, it is a concern that must be weighed against the benefits of licensing. It is difficult to completely prevent, particularly in a society that values individual autonomy. One strategy for mitigating this incentive could be to offer licenses first or only to people likely to encounter infection in any event, such as health care workers. Another approach could be to first license members of lower-risk groups, such as university students, who are not being asked to take as many personal protective measures. Yet another approach could be to focus licensing on high-risk groups who are less likely to voluntarily seek infection. A final option might be to have license applicants self-attest that they did not intentionally become infected. These mitigation strategies could be phased in or out depending on whether there is actual evidence that this incentive is producing undesirable outcomes.\nFourth, the benefits of immunity licenses could encourage forgery, illegal markets, or fraud by unethical physicians or testing facilities. These problems underscore the need for careful implementation through strategies like anticounterfeiting designs, cryptographic or biometric features, and reliable chains of verification for tests. But they do not vitiate the advantages of licensing. The possibility of bribed examiners or forged documents has not undermined driver\u2019s licenses and passports.\nConclusions\nImmunity-based licenses have the potential to help realize important values, including enhancing the liberty of individuals who have been infected with COVID-19 without worsening the situation of those who have not been infected, maximizing benefits to individuals and society by allowing immune people to engage in economic activity, and protecting the least advantaged by allowing safer care for vulnerable populations. Importantly, immunity-based licenses do not violate equal treatment because the factors used to grant a license are not discriminatory, like race or religion, but instead grounded in relevant evidence. While immunity-based licenses require careful implementation and scientific support to be ethical in practice, nothing makes them unethical in principle.\nBack to top\nArticle Information\nCorresponding Author: Ezekiel J.

This is frequently addressed with a propensity score (PS) that summarizes differences in patient characteristics between treatment groups. The PS is the probability that each individual will be assigned to receive the treatment of interest given their measured covariates.2 Matching or weighting on the PS is used to adjust comparisons between the 2 groups being compared.2,3\nIn an article in JAMA Cardiology, Mehta et al evaluated the association between angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs), angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs), or both with testing positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), in 18\u202f472 patients who were tested in the Cleveland Clinic Health System between March 8, 2020, and April 12, 2020.4 Overlap weighting5,6 based on the PS was used to adjust for confounding in the comparison of 2285 patients who had been treated with ACEIs/ARBs with 16\u202f187 patients who did not receive ACEIs/ARBs. After adjustment, there was no significant association between ACEI/ARB use and testing positive for SARS-CoV-2.\nUse of the Method\nWhy Is Overlap Weighting Used?\nOverlap weighting is a PS method that attempts to mimic important attributes of randomized clinical trials: a clinically relevant target population, covariate balance, and precision. The target population is the group of patients for whom the conclusions are drawn.3\ufeff Balance refers to the similarity of patient characteristics across treatment, which is an important condition to avoid bias. Precision denotes the certainty about the estimate of association between the treatment and the outcome of interest; more precise estimates have narrower CIs and greater statistical power. Although classic PS methods of inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) and matching can adjust for differences in measured characteristics,2,3 these methods have potential limitations with respect to target population, balance, and precision.5\nConventional IPTW assigns a weight of 1/PS for treated and 1/(1\u2009\u2212\u2009PS) for untreated patients, allowing individuals with underrepresented characteristics to count more in the analysis.3 Matching operates differently by taking each treated study participant and finding the closest PS match among controls, usually within a bound. In observational data, in which the initial differences in treatment groups may be large, these methods can modify the target population,3 fail to achieve good balance, or substantially worsen precision.5\nOverlap weighting overcomes these limitations by assigning weights to each patient that are proportional to the probability of that patient belonging to the opposite treatment group.6 Specifically, treated patients are weighted by the probability of not receiving treatment (1\u2009\u2212\u2009PS) and untreated patients are weighted by the probability of receiving the treatment (PS). These weights are smaller for extreme PS values so that outliers who are nearly always treated (PS near 1) or never treated (PS near 0) do not dominate results and worsen precision, as occurs with IPTW. These outliers contribute relatively less to the result, while patients whose characteristics are compatible with either treatment contribute relatively more (Figure, A and B). The resulting target population mimics the characteristics of a pragmatic randomized trial that is highly inclusive, excluding no study participants from the available sample but emphasizing the comparison of patients at clinical equipoise. Moreover, overlap weighting has desirable statistical properties. It leads to exact balance on the mean of every measured covariate when the PS is estimated by a logistic regression and is proven to optimize precision of the estimated association between treatment and outcomes among a large class of PS weighting methods, including IPTW and an analogue to matching.6 Overlap weighting can be as efficient as randomization if no adjustment was needed.5\nWhat Are the Limitations of Overlap Weighting?\nLike all PS methods, overlap weighting cannot adjust for patient characteristics that are not measured and included in the model for the PS. It is important to identify confounding variables from the literature, attempt to include them in the analysis, and recognize potential bias due to unmeasured factors. For applications in which the initial imbalances in patient characteristics between treatment groups are modest, overlap weighting yields similar results to IPTW. The advantages of overlap weighting are greatest when comparator groups are initially very different.\nWhy Did the Authors Use Overlap Weighting in This Study?\nMehta et al4 used overlap weighting to achieve good balance and minimize variance of the estimated association between ACEI/ARB treatment and test results positive for SARS-CoV-2. Both goals were achieved. Balance was demonstrated by reporting the overlap weighted covariate means (or proportions) for the group that received ACEIs/ARBs and the group that did not receive ACEIs/ARBs. There was no difference between groups after weighting (Figure, C). The list of covariates included risk factors related to receiving ACEI/ARB treatment and associated with testing positive for COVID-19. The adjusted treatment comparisons were estimated with narrow CIs, providing strong evidence for the null result.\nHow Should the Results of Overlap Weighting Be Interpreted in This Study?\nThe primary results of the study by Mehta et al4 can be interpreted just like other PS methods. That is, after adjustment for differences in cardiovascular risk factors, 9.1% of patients who were treated with ACEIs/ARBs tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 compared with 9.4% of patients who were not treated with ACEIs/ARBs (odds ratio, 0.97 [95% CI, 0.81-1.15]). These estimates are measures of association between ACEI/ARB status and test positivity, with respect to a population of patients at equipoise either to receive treatment with ACEIs/ARBs or not and for whom all measured covariates are made similar across treatments through overlap weighting. Bias due to unmeasured differences between patients who received ACEI/ARB treatment vs those who did not cannot be ruled out.\nCaveats to Consider When Assessing the Results of an Overlap-Weighted Analysis\nOverlap weighting creates exact balance on the mean of every measured covariate when the PS is estimated by logistic regression (Figure, C). This is particularly important for reducing bias7; however, balance on the mean may not result in complete adjustment for confounding on that variable. In addition, the baseline characteristics table of the overlap weighted sample should be presented (Table 2 and 3 in Mehta et al4). This table can include covariate means, medians, interquartile ranges, or any other statistics that are useful to understanding the population. This approach will help to demonstrate which randomized clinical trial is best emulated by the overlap weighted analysis with respect to target population, balance, and precision.\nSection Editors: Roger J.
