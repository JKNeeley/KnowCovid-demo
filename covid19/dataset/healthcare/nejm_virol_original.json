Most cases among residents included respiratory illness consistent with Covid-19; however, in 7 residents no symptoms were documented. Hospitalization rates for facility residents, visitors, and staff were 54.5%, 50.0%, and 6.0%, respectively. The case fatality rate for residents was 33.7% (34 of 101). As of March 18, a total of 30 long-term care facilities with at least one confirmed case of Covid-19 had been identified in King County.\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn the context of rapidly escalating Covid-19 outbreaks, proactive steps by long-term care facilities to identify and exclude potentially infected staff and visitors, actively monitor for potentially infected patients, and implement appropriate infection prevention and control measures are needed to prevent the introduction of Covid-19.\nOn December 31, 2019, China reported a cluster of pneumonia cases of unknown cause that would later be identified as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).1-3 Patients with the illness, called coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19), frequently present with fever, cough, and shortness of breath within 2 to 14 days after exposure.4 As of March 23, 2020, there had been 332,930 confirmed cases of Covid-19 reported globally, and 14,510 deaths had been reported.5 In recognition of the widespread global transmission of Covid-19, the World Health Organization declared Covid-19 to be a pandemic on March 11, 2020.6 The first case of Covid-19 in the United States was diagnosed on January 20, 2020, in Snohomish County, Washington, in a person who had recently traveled to Wuhan, China.7\nOn February 28, Public Health\u2013Seattle and King County (PHSKC) was notified of a positive Covid-19 test result from a patient who had been admitted to a local hospital and tested on the basis of newly revised testing criteria from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).8 The patient resided in Facility A, a skilled nursing facility with approximately 130 facility residents and 170 staff. When the initial case was confirmed on February 28, 2020, PHSKC and the CDC immediately began case investigation, contact tracing, quarantine of exposed persons, isolation of persons with confirmed or suspected Covid-19, and on-site enhancement of infection prevention and control. Some of the information obtained through the investigation was rapidly reported through a Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report.9\nCase Report\nOn February 27, 2020, PHSKC was notified of a 73-year-old woman with cough, fever, and shortness of breath who resided in Facility A, in which a cluster of unexplained febrile respiratory illness was occurring. The index patient had symptom onset on February 19 and worsening respiratory status requiring supplemental oxygen for 5 days before she was transferred to a local hospital on February 24, 2020. At the hospital, she was found to be febrile (temperature as high as 39.6\u00b0C), with tachycardia, tachypnea, and hypoxemia (oxygen saturation, 83% while she was breathing ambient air). She became more hypoxemic over the next 24 hours, despite bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP), and was intubated on February 25, 2020, because of respiratory failure. A computed tomographic (CT) scan of the chest revealed diffuse bilateral pulmonary infiltrates. Her medical history included insulin-dependent type II diabetes mellitus, obesity, chronic kidney disease, hypertension, coronary artery disease, and congestive heart failure. She had no known travel or contact with persons known to have Covid-19.\nMultiplex viral respiratory panel and bacterial cultures (sputum and bronchoalveolar lavage) were unrevealing. The CDC testing criteria for Covid-19 had been recently revised to include severely ill persons for whom no cause had been identified.10 On February 27, an astute clinician requested Covid-19 testing on the basis of the new CDC criteria allowing testing in cases of severe, unexplained pneumonia despite the lack of an epidemiologic link and obtained nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs and a sputum specimen to test for SARS-CoV-2 by real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR). On February 28, 2020, results were positive, 9 days after symptom onset and 4 days after hospital admission. The patient died on March 2, 2020.\nMethods\nIn response to the travel-associated case of Covid-19 in neighboring Snohomish County, PHSKC activated its emergency response on January 20, 2020, and began active surveillance for Covid-19, focused on identifying cases of suspected and confirmed Covid-19 and tracing contacts. PHSKC collects data on demographics, clinical status, and results of laboratory testing gathered from Covid-19 case investigations into its local surveillance database and analyzes these data in combination with laboratory records and case reports obtained from the Washington Disease Reporting System.\nOn receiving notification on February 28 of the Covid-19 diagnosis for the index patient, who was a resident of Facility A, PHSKC immediately began an investigation of the cluster of Covid-19\u2013like illness that was occurring in this facility. A CDC field team arrived on March 1, at the request of PHSKC, to assist with the investigation. Facility residents, visitors, and health care personnel with confirmed Covid-19 were interviewed by telephone to collect information on symptoms, severity, coexisting conditions, travel history, and close contacts with known Covid-19. Guidance related to self-isolation, self-quarantine, and testing for symptomatic close contacts was provided during interviews, as appropriate. If a case patient was unable to be interviewed (e.g., because the patient had been intubated), a proxy was asked to provide as many details as possible. Medical chart abstractions were performed to confirm information about underlying health conditions among facility residents with Covid-19.\nSpecimen collection and diagnostic testing were conducted in accordance with CDC guidelines.11 In brief, upper respiratory specimens (nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs) were collected with synthetic fiber swabs. Each swab was stored in a sterile tube with viral transport media between 2\u00b0C and 8\u00b0C before being transported to the Washington Department of Health Public Health Laboratory for diagnostic testing. Sputum was collected only when the person had a productive cough or when clinically indicated. Diagnostic testing was done in accordance with the CDC\u2019s SARS-CoV-2 rRT-PCR panel for detection of SARS-CoV-2.12-14\nAs part of the intensive response, at least 100 long-term care facilities in King County were contacted by email on March 6, 2020, through a REDCap survey that was used to obtain information on residents or staff known to have Covid-19 or on clusters of influenza-like illness among residents and staff. Nonresponders were sent up to five reminders to complete the survey.15 In addition, countywide databases that capture all emergency medical service transfers from long-term care facilities to acute care facilities were reviewed on a daily basis for evidence of cases or clusters of influenza-like illness. Finally, routine passive surveillance for influenza-like illness clusters in long-term care facilities was used to identify possible Covid-19; reporting is mandated for a confirmed case of influenza or for two or more cases of influenza-like illness in a 72-hour period. All long-term care facilities with evidence of a cluster of respiratory illness were contacted by telephone for additional information, including information on infection-control strategies that were in place and on personal protective equipment (PPE) supplies. On the basis of this information, the long-term care facilities were prioritized according to risk of Covid-19 introduction, and the highest-priority facilities were visited by response personnel to perform diagnostic testing of those with influenza-like illness and to implement infection-control assessment, training, and support.\nResults\nOn February 28, 2020, four cases of Covid-19 were confirmed among residents of King County; 1 person had presumed travel-related exposure, and 3 were identified by testing hospitalized patients who had severe respiratory illness (e.g., pneumonia) and who had tested negative for influenza and other respiratory pathogens. One of these was the index patient from Facility A; one was a Facility A staff member. When the index case was identified on February 28, at least 45 residents and staff dispersed across Facility A had symptoms of respiratory illness; PHSKC was notified of this increase by the facility on February 27.\nFigure 1.\nConfirmed Cases of Covid-19 Linked to Facility A.\nTable 1.\nDemographic and Clinical Characteristics of Persons with Confirmed Covid-19 Linked to Facility A.\nAs of March 18, a total of 167 persons with Covid-19 that was epidemiologically linked to Facility A had been identified (Figure 1); 144 were residents of King County and 23 were residents of Snohomish County. Cases of Covid-19 occurred among facility residents (101 persons), health care personnel (50), and visitors (16) (Table 1). Among facility residents, 118 were tested; 101 results were positive and 17 negative. Most affected persons had respiratory illness consistent with Covid-19; however, chart review of facility residents found that in 7 cases no symptoms had been documented. Clinical presentation ranged from mild (no hospitalization) to severe, including 35 deaths by March 18. Reported dates of symptom onset ranged from February 15 to March 13. The median age of the patients was 83 years (range, 51 to 100) among facility residents, 62.5 years (range, 52 to 88) among visitors, and 43.5 years (range, 21 to 79) among facility personnel; 112 patients (67.1%) were women (Table 1). The hospitalization rates for residents, visitors, and staff were 54.5%, 50.0%, and 6.0%, respectively. As of March 18, the preliminary case fatality rate was 33.7% for residents and 6.2% for visitors; no staff members had died. Most (94.1% of 101) facility residents had chronic underlying health conditions, with hypertension (67.3%), cardiac disease (60.4%), renal disease (40.6%), diabetes mellitus (31.7%), pulmonary disease (31.7%), and obesity (30.7%) being most common. Of the coexisting conditions evaluated, hypertension was the only underlying condition present in 7 facility residents with Covid-19. The 50 health care personnel with confirmed Covid-19 worked in the following occupational categories: physical therapist, occupational therapist assistant, speech pathologist, environmental care (housekeeping, maintenance), nurse, certified nursing assistant, health information officer, physician, and case manager.\nFigure 2.\nTimeline Showing Long-Term Care Facilities in King County with One or More Confirmed Cases of COVID-19.\nThrough ongoing surveillance and outreach to provide technical assistance with infection prevention and control to long-term care facilities (e.g., nursing homes, assisted living), a total of 30 King County facilities with at least one confirmed Covid-19 case, including Facility A, were identified by March 18. Of the first 8 facilities affected after Facility A, at least 3 had clear epidemiologic links to Facility A (Figure 2). Two of the facilities with definitive epidemiologic links had staff working both at that facility and at Facility A; the third facility had received two patient transfers from Facility A. Information received from surveys of long-term care facilities and on-site visits identified factors that were likely to have contributed to the vulnerability of these facilities, including staff who had worked while symptomatic; staff who worked in more than one facility; inadequate familiarity with and adherence to PPE recommendations; challenges to implementing proper infection control practices, including inadequate supplies of PPE and other items (e.g., alcohol-based hand sanitizer); delayed recognition of cases because of a low index of suspicion; limited availability of testing; and difficulty identifying persons with Covid-19 on the basis of signs and symptoms alone. Examples of specific PPE challenges included an initial lack of available eye protection, frequent changes in PPE types because supply chains were disrupted and PPE was being obtained through various donations or suppliers, and a need for a designated staff member to observe PPE use to ensure that staff were consistent with safe PPE handling (e.g., not touching or adjusting face protection, primarily face masks, during extended use). Working collaboratively, state and local health departments and CDC staff provided five focused PPE trainings for facility staff, including donning and doffing demonstrations and practice, and three additional basic infection control visits, including hand hygiene assessments, audits of PPE use, and reviews of environmental cleaning and disinfection practices.\nDiscussion\nThe vulnerability of long-term care facilities to respiratory disease outbreaks, including influenza and other commonly circulating human coronaviruses such as the common cold, is well recognized.16,17 As this report shows, the spread of Covid-19 reflected the same vulnerability in at least one long-term care facility. In total, 167 confirmed cases of Covid-19 had been identified among residents, personnel, and visitors as of March 18, and 30 skilled nursing and assisted living facilities in King County had identified at least one confirmed case of Covid-19. Staff working in multiple facilities while ill and transfers of patients from one facility to another potentially introduced Covid-19 into some of these facilities. The transmission within Facility A and to other facilities in the area posed a serious threat to the medically vulnerable population residing within long-term care facilities and strained the local acute care hospitals. Although the use of vaccine and antiviral medications can be effective in reducing the spread of influenza in long-term care facilities, such interventions are not currently available for Covid-19.18 Residents and health care personnel at long-term care facilities are at risk for Covid-19 transmission and severe outcomes, particularly for residents who are predominantly at advanced ages and have underlying medical conditions. Publicly available information on staffing and quality measures shows no indication that baseline practices at Facility A placed residents at greater risk than residents at other similar facilities.\nThis investigation had a number of limitations. Not all residents and staff were interviewed and tested for SARS-CoV-2, which might have led to under-ascertainment of infections, particularly for those who were presymptomatic or asymptomatic. For example, at another facility (Facility B) that had a subsequent Covid-19 outbreak epidemiologically linked to Facility A, swabbing of all residents revealed that infections with low cycle threshold values (indicating a large quantity of viral RNA) occurred among some residents who did not have symptoms.19 There was not a complete roster of visitors to Facility A, and it is possible that some infections among visitors were also missed by these surveillance and investigation efforts. Because symptom onset dates were not available in many cases, the epidemic curve is presented by date of report; however, this does not adequately represent the timing of disease onset in the facility, given that the median time from symptom onset to diagnosis in this cohort was 8 days but had considerable variability. Finally, case ascertainment and testing ramped up after the outbreak was recognized at Facility A, but there could have been infections and transmission at other facilities in the area earlier.\nOn March 10, 2020, the governor of Washington implemented mandatory screening of health care workers and visitor restrictions for all licensed nursing homes and assisted living facilities.20 These strategies are coordinated and supported by public health authorities, partnering health care systems, regulatory agencies, and their respective governing bodies.20-23 Local and state authorities strengthened prevention and mitigation strategies targeting transmission of Covid-19 and other respiratory viruses in long-term care facilities that include screening and restricted access policies for visitors and nonessential personnel; screening of health care personnel, including measurement of body temperature and interviewing for presence of respiratory symptoms, to identify and exclude symptomatic workers; strategies for close clinical monitoring of residents; social distancing, including restricting resident movement and group activities; staff training on infection prevention and control and PPE use; and establishment of plans for county and state coordination of needs and contingency plans for acquiring PPE in anticipation of delays or interruptions in supply.20,22,24,25 In addition to education, hands-on training, and maintaining adequate supplies, facilities need to reinforce staff adherence to infection prevention and control practices with regular auditing and feedback from observation of staff workflow. Substantial disruptions, such as staff absenteeism and increased workload, may affect the consistency with which these practices are implemented and monitored. The impact of these policies in protecting long-term care facilities should continue to be evaluated, along with the role of serial testing strategies to identify infected staff or patients as testing reagents and supplies become more available.\nThe experience described here indicates that outbreaks of Covid-19 in long-term care facilities can have a considerable impact on vulnerable older adults and local health care systems. The findings also suggest that once Covid-19 has been introduced into a long-term care facility, it has the potential to spread rapidly and widely. This can cause serious adverse outcomes among facility residents and staff, which underscores the importance of proactive steps to identify and exclude potentially infected staff and visitors, early recognition of potentially infected patients, and implementation of appropriate infection prevention and control measures.21-24,26 Lessons learned from this initial cluster can provide valuable guidance for long-term care facilities in other parts of the United States.\nDisclosure forms provided by the authors are available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org.\nDrs.

Using Bayesian methods, we compared outcomes in patients who had been treated with these medications and in untreated patients, overall and in those with hypertension, after propensity-score matching for receipt of each medication class. A difference of at least 10 percentage points was prespecified as a substantial difference.\nRESULTS\nAmong 12,594 patients who were tested for Covid-19, a total of 5894 (46.8%) were positive; 1002 of these patients (17.0%) had severe illness. A history of hypertension was present in 4357 patients (34.6%), among whom 2573 (59.1%) had a positive test; 634 of these patients (24.6%) had severe illness. There was no association between any single medication class and an increased likelihood of a positive test. None of the medications examined was associated with a substantial increase in the risk of severe illness among patients who tested positive.\nCONCLUSIONS\nWe found no substantial increase in the likelihood of a positive test for Covid-19 or in the risk of severe Covid-19 among patients who tested positive in association with five common classes of antihypertensive medications.\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19), can infect host cells by means of interaction with membrane-bound angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) on respiratory epithelium.1 ACE2 is part of the renin\u2013angiotensin\u2013aldosterone system (RAAS) and its neurohormonal pathways; treatment with RAAS inhibitors can increase tissue expression of ACE2 and its presentation at the cell surface.2 For this reason, it has been suggested that treatment with ACE inhibitors or angiotensin-receptor blockers (ARBs) might increase the risk of Covid-19 after exposure to SARS-CoV-2.2-7 Some have suggested that calcium-channel blockers, which do not act on the RAAS, may be the preferred antihypertensive agents during the Covid-19 pandemic.8 Further fueling these concerns is the observation that hypertension may be associated with an increased risk of death among patients with Covid-19. A large, multicenter study on hypertension and risk of Covid-19 indicated that 24% of patients with severe disease had hypertension, as compared with 14% of patients with nonsevere disease, although that analysis was not adjusted for other clinical features.9\nHowever, ACE2 is protective in animal models of acute lung injury, and pretreatment with ACE inhibitors, ARBs, or beta-blockers may reduce the extent of experimentally induced lung injury and improve outcomes, an effect mediated by inhibition of the RAAS.2,10-15 Thus, others have hypothesized that these medications could theoretically be beneficial, reducing the risk of severe disease among patients with Covid-19.2\nOwing to the high global prevalence of hypertension (estimated to be 46% among adults in the United States), the relation between antihypertensive medications and Covid-19 outcomes is very important to public health.2,16 These considerations led the Heart Failure Society of America, the American College of Cardiology, and the American Heart Association to issue a joint statement calling for immediate research into this issue.17 We sought to estimate the association between the use of antihypertensive medications and the likelihood of a positive test for Covid-19 as well as the likelihood of severe Covid-19 (defined as intensive care, mechanical ventilation, or death) in a cohort of patients in a large health care network in New York City, an epicenter of the global Covid-19 pandemic.\nMethods\nPATIENT POPULATION\nWe identified all the patients in the New York University (NYU) Langone Health electronic health record who had Covid-19 test results recorded from March 1 to April 15, 2020, including tests sent to commercial laboratories, tests performed at our local laboratory, and tests ordered by NYU Langone Health providers and conducted at the New York City or State Department of Health. Patients were deemed to be Covid-19\u2013positive if any test was positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA and Covid-19\u2013negative if all tests were negative.\nMEDICATION AND HISTORY ASSESSMENT\nFor each identified patient with Covid-19 test results, we extracted medical history from the chart on the basis of discretely documented diagnostic codes that had been entered into the medical history or problem list sections of the medical record or on the basis of encounter diagnoses, and we characterized the patient as having or not having a history of hypertension, heart failure, myocardial infarction, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, and obstructive lung disease (e.g., asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) on the basis of documentation present in the preceding 18 months, because these disorders are often treated with the medications of interest (Table S1 in the Supplementary Appendix, available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org). We extracted medication data for each patient, on the basis of the history in the electronic health record, and defined previous treatment with an antihypertensive medication as use of the medication within the preceding 18 months, provided that there was no evidence that the medication was discontinued at least 1 month before the Covid-19 test. The criteria for medication use included clinical documentation in the chart of prescribed medications. Medication lists and problem lists are updated frequently in our electronic health record by clinicians, who are routinely prompted by the system to cross-reference the medication list with pharmacy fill records and to ask patients about adherence.\nWe report here on the following classes of antihypertensive medication \u2014 ACE inhibitors, ARBs, beta-blockers, calcium-channel blockers, and thiazide diuretics. We also analyzed the composite of treatment with ACE inhibitors or ARBs, because they act on the same system and are rarely used together. In this study, we considered sacubitril\u2013valsartan to be an ARB.\nSTUDY OVERSIGHT\nOur observational study was designed by the authors and approved with a waiver of authorization and informed consent by the institutional review board of the NYU Grossman School of Medicine. The data were analyzed by three of the authors, who vouch for the analysis. Four of the authors vouch for the accuracy of the data. The first author prepared the first draft of the manuscript. Four of the authors had full access to the data and were responsible for the decision to submit the manuscript for publication.\nANALYSIS OVERVIEW\nWe calculated the percentages of patients who were Covid-19\u2013negative and who were Covid-19\u2013positive among tested patients, both overall and among patients with a history of hypertension as noted in the electronic health record. Patients with no medical record data other than the Covid-19 test result were excluded from the analysis. Among the patients with a positive Covid-19 test result, we identified patients with severe Covid-19, which was defined as admission to the intensive care unit (ICU), the use of invasive or noninvasive mechanical ventilation, or death. We computed the percentages of patients who met and those who did not meet this definition of severe illness as of April 15, 2020, among patients who tested positive for Covid-19.\nTo address confounding by indication and other sources of bias arising from the use of observational data, we estimated a propensity score for the likelihood of treatment with each medication class of interest, and we matched patients who had been treated with each medication class to those who had not been treated with that medication class using a 1:1 ratio without replacement, according to the estimated propensity scores.18 We assessed the percentage of patients who tested positive for Covid-19 and the percentage of patients with a positive test who had severe Covid-19, in relation to each medication class, using data before and after matching.\nSTATISTICAL ANALYSIS\nFor a given medication class, we used propensity-score models that adjusted for the following variables \u2014 age; sex; race; ethnic group; body-mass index; smoking history; history of hypertension, myocardial infarction, heart failure, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, and obstructive lung disease (e.g., asthma and obstructive pulmonary diseases); and other classes of medication. Propensity-score matching was implemented with the use of a nearest-neighbor strategy. The caliper for the matching was specified in the nearest-neighbor strategy if the unspecified approach did not result in satisfactory balance. For body-mass index, the mean value was imputed for patients with missing data. Our goal was to rule out a clinically meaningful difference in risk, which we defined a priori as an absolute difference of at least 10 percentage points in the likelihood of a positive or negative test for Covid-19 and in the likelihood of the presence or absence of severe Covid-19. Our primary analysis involved patients with hypertension. We also analyzed data from all patients, without regard to hypertension.\nBefore and after creating the matched sets for each medication class, we computed the difference in the likelihood of the outcome between patients who had been treated and those who had not been treated with each medication class, and we sampled from the posterior distribution of the difference in these proportions using the posterior probabilities conditional on the outcomes in each medication group and a prior distribution. As our prior distribution, we assumed a Beta (a,b) distribution, a conjugate to the binomial distribution, with both shape parameters a and b equal to 1. Because very few data are currently available, these uninformative parameters produce prior probabilities of outcomes that are distributed uniformly between 0 and 1. We estimated the difference as the median of the posterior samples, along with a 95% credible interval for the difference. Association between a medication class and an outcome was considered to be present when the 95% credible interval excluded zero. A substantial difference was considered to be present when the lower boundary of the 95% credible interval exceeded zero and the upper boundary exceeded 10 percentage points. We conducted sensitivity analyses using traditional frequentist approaches rather than Bayesian approaches and using adjusted logistic regression rather than propensity-score matching. Analyses were performed with the use of R statistical software, version 3.6.1 (with the libraries MatchIt and BayesianFirstAid).\nResults\nCHARACTERISTICS OF THE PATIENTS\nFigure 1.\nPatient Population.\nTable 1.\nCharacteristics of the Study Population of Patients Tested for Covid-19.\nAs of April 15, 2020, a total of 12,594 patients had a Covid-19 test result and had an office, emergency department, or inpatient encounter in the NYU Langone Health system. Among these patients, 5894 (46.8%) had a positive test result and 6700 (53.2%) had a negative test result (Figure 1). Among the 5894 patients with a positive test, 1002 (17.0%) had severe Covid-19, as indicated by ICU admission (in 726 patients), mechanical ventilation (in 311), or death (in 447) by April 15, 2020. The characteristics of the patients in the study population are shown in Table 1.\nMEDICATION USE AND COVID-19 TEST RESULTS IN PATIENTS WITH HYPERTENSION\nTable 2.\nLikelihood of Positive Test for Covid-19, According to Treatment with Various Antihypertensive Agents, among Propensity-Score\u2013Matched Patients, with Hypertension and Overall.\nAmong the 12,594 patients who underwent testing for Covid-19, a total of 4357 (34.6%) had a history of hypertension; of these patients, 2573 (59.1%) were Covid-19\u2013positive and 1784 (40.9%) were Covid-19\u2013negative. The results of Covid-19 testing stratified according to previous treatment with each medication class in matched patients are shown in Table 2. We ruled out an absolute difference of at least 10 percentage points in the likelihood of a positive test with at least 97.5% certainty for ACE inhibitors, ARBs, beta-blockers, calcium-channel blockers, and thiazide diuretics.\nThe results of the unmatched analyses are shown in Table S2. In the unmatched analyses, several medication classes were associated with a higher likelihood of testing positive for Covid-19, probably owing to confounding by characteristics of the patients who were treated. Results of propensity-score\u2013matching quality are shown in Tables S4 through S9. The standardized mean differences for each class of medication was greatly reduced after matching.\nMEDICATION USE AND COVID-19 SEVERITY IN PATIENTS WITH HYPERTENSION\nTable 3.\nLikelihood of Severe Covid-19, According to Treatment with Various Antihypertensive Agents, in Propensity-Score\u2013Matched Patients with a Positive Test for Covid-19, with Hypertension and Overall.\nAmong the 2573 patients with hypertension and positive results on Covid-19 testing, 634 (24.6%) had severe Covid-19, as indicated by ICU admission (in 422 patients), mechanical ventilation (in 165), or death (in 343) by April 15, 2020. The likelihood of severe Covid-19 among patients who tested positive, matched on propensity score for previous treatment with each medication class, is shown in Table 3. We ruled out a substantial difference (\u226510 percentage points) in the likelihood of severe illness with at least 97.5% certainty for all the medication classes. There was a slightly higher likelihood of severe illness associated with the previous use of calcium-channel blockers (median difference between treated patients and untreated patients, 4.4 percentage points; 95% credible interval, 0.5 to 8.2). The results of unmatched analyses are provided in Table S3.\nANALYSES IN ALL PROPENSITY-SCORE\u2013MATCHED PATIENTS\nThe results of Covid-19 testing stratified according to previous treatment with each medication class in all propensity-score\u2013matched patients, without regard to hypertension history, are shown in Table 2. We ruled out a substantial difference in the likelihood of severe Covid-19 with at least 97.5% certainty for all the medication classes. Patients who had been taking a beta-blocker had a marginally lower likelihood of a positive Covid-19 test than did matched patients who were not taking a beta-blocker (median difference, \u22123.8 percentage points; 95% credible interval, \u22127.1 to \u22120.4). The results of the unmatched analyses are shown in Tables S2 and S3, and the results of propensity-score\u2013matching quality are shown in Tables S10 through S15.\nThe likelihood of severe Covid-19 among all the patients who tested positive, matched on propensity score for previous treatment with each medication class, is shown in Table 3. We ruled out a substantial difference in the likelihood of severe Covid-19 with at least 97.5% certainty for all the medication classes. Sensitivity analyses with the use of frequentist analyses of propensity-score\u2013matched sets and multivariate logistic regression showed unchanged conclusions in every case (Tables S16 through S19).\nDiscussion\nIn this observational analysis in a cohort of more than 12,500 patients who were tested for Covid-19 in a large health network in New York City, previous treatment with medications acting on the RAAS was not associated with a higher risk of testing positive for Covid-19. There was also no substantially higher risk (by \u226510 percentage points) of severe Covid-19 associated with any of the medications studied among the patients with a positive test in our cohort. In most cases, the study sample size permitted us, with a high degree of confidence, to rule out that the risk was higher \u2014 even by as little as 6 percentage points \u2014 among treated patients than among untreated patients. An effect size smaller than 10 percentage points may be of clinical interest, but we elected to report our findings now before the accrual of a larger sample in order to provide actionable information to the medical community, given the urgency and the rapid progression of the pandemic. Our findings may help to allay concerns on the part of patients and providers regarding the continued use of these agents in patients undergoing testing or receiving treatment for Covid-19.\nOur data suggested a modestly lower likelihood of a positive test for Covid-19 among patients taking beta-blockers that was of marginal significance in an analysis that included all matched patients. This finding could be attributable to effects of beta-blockers on the expression or presentation at the cell surface of ACE2, the viral receptor for SARS-CoV-2, or residual confounding in the observational study design. To be relevant in SARS-CoV-2 infection, the effect on ACE2 would need to be present on respiratory epithelium, but relevant studies in animals or humans are limited, so this proposed mechanism remains speculative. Furthermore, we did not observe a similar effect with ACE inhibitors or ARBs, which would be expected to have similar effects on ACE2. Because beta-blockers, ACE inhibitors, and ARBs act at different points in the RAAS, their effects on the risk of Covid-19 or the severity of Covid-19 could potentially differ. Our observation of a lack of association between beta-blocker use and the likelihood of severe Covid-19 argues against an antiviral effect.\nTwo small studies have shown consistent findings regarding the association between cardiac medications and Covid-19. In a multisite database study that included 78 patients with hypertension who were 65 years of age or older in China, there was no association between previous treatment with any cardiovascular medication class and severe Covid-19, but the risk of severe Covid-19 was lower in a subgroup of 46 patients who had received previous treatment with an ARB than among patients who had not received any of the five drug classes assessed in our study.19 A single-center study from China showed no significant difference in the likelihood of severe illness related to treatment with ACE inhibitors or ARBs in 42 patients.20\nA limitation of our study is that variations in the diagnostic characteristics for the Covid-19 testing methods that were used in our cohort may have led to misclassification of Covid-19 status. The true sensitivity of testing remains unknown. Some patients in the cohort underwent multiple tests, which increased the likelihood of identifying disease. At this time, many persons with possible Covid-19 in New York City and elsewhere are not tested, particularly those who are not hospitalized. Thus, our study may include an overestimation of the proportion of cases of severe Covid-19. That said, it is unlikely that reduced access to testing would add systematic bias in assessment of the relation between use of antihypertensive medications and Covid-19.\nThere are several other caveats to consider in interpretation of our analysis. Ascertainment of medication use from the electronic health record may not reflect actual drug exposure. We did not account for socioeconomic status, insurance, or health care access in propensity scores. However, the medication classes that we studied are available as generic drugs, including within the New York City public hospital system, which serves a largely indigent population. Despite propensity-score matching, there may be additional unmeasured confounders affecting our results. Propensity-score matching aims to create overall balance between comparison groups. Our confidence in the evidence from the primary Bayesian analysis is also supported by the sensitivity analyses that used frequentist methods. Some patients in the NYU Langone Health system may have been tested at other health care systems, and we did not have access to those test results.\nWe identified no adverse effects of use of medications that act on RAAS pathways on the likelihood of a positive test for Covid-19 among patients who were tested or on the likelihood of severe Covid-19 among patients with a positive test.\nDisclosure forms provided by the authors are available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org.\nThis article was published on May 1, 2020, at NEJM.org.\nAuthor Affiliations\nFrom the New York University (NYU) Grossman School of Medicine, New York.\nAddress reprint requests to Dr. Reynolds at the Cardiovascular Clinical Research Center, Leon H.

A total of 6272 case patients in whom infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was confirmed between February 21 and March 11, 2020, were matched to 30,759 beneficiaries of the Regional Health Service (controls) according to sex, age, and municipality of residence. Information about the use of selected drugs and patients\u2019 clinical profiles was obtained from regional databases of health care use. Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals for associations between drugs and infection, with adjustment for confounders, were estimated by means of logistic regression.\nRESULTS\nAmong both case patients and controls, the mean (\u00b1SD) age was 68\u00b113 years, and 37% were women. The use of ACE inhibitors and ARBs was more common among case patients than among controls, as was the use of other antihypertensive and non-antihypertensive drugs, and case patients had a worse clinical profile. Use of ARBs or ACE inhibitors did not show any association with Covid-19 among case patients overall (adjusted odds ratio, 0.95 [95% confidence interval {CI}, 0.86 to 1.05] for ARBs and 0.96 [95% CI, 0.87 to 1.07] for ACE inhibitors) or among patients who had a severe or fatal course of the disease (adjusted odds ratio, 0.83 [95% CI, 0.63 to 1.10] for ARBs and 0.91 [95% CI, 0.69 to 1.21] for ACE inhibitors), and no association between these variables was found according to sex.\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn this large, population-based study, the use of ACE inhibitors and ARBs was more frequent among patients with Covid-19 than among controls because of their higher prevalence of cardiovascular disease. However, there was no evidence that ACE inhibitors or ARBs affected the risk of COVID-19.\nStudies in animals have shown that angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a membrane-bound aminopeptidase that is abundantly expressed in the lungs, the heart, and other tissues,1 is used by coronaviruses as a functional receptor for their entrance into the cells.2,3 Angiotensin-receptor blockers (ARBs) and ACE inhibitors are considered first-choice drugs in hypertension, heart failure, post\u2013myocardial infarction states, and chronic kidney disease and also increase the expression of ACE2.4,5 Given these facts and observations, the hypothesis that their use may modify susceptibility to infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in humans has developed. There is, however, no consensus as to whether the risk and severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection might be increased or reduced with the use of such agents.1,6-10\nCurrent published clinical data are largely limited to small, uncontrolled studies of the demographic and clinical characteristics of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19), with little or no information regarding the type of antihypertensive treatment that they were taking at or close to the time of infection.11-15 This lack of information has been problematic, given the possibility that blockers of the renin\u2013angiotensin\u2013aldosterone system (RAAS) may affect the susceptibility to and the severity of Covid-19, an issue that has received much press and may influence patient behavior with respect to taking or discontinuing these agents, despite the advice of a number of professional scientific societies not to discontinue them.16-19 To date, reports indicate that withdrawal of RAAS blockers in patients with conditions for which these medications are commonly used leads to a marked increase in the risk of complications and death.20-22\nThe recent Covid-19 epidemic spread to and increased exponentially in Italy earlier than in any other Western country. By far the most severely hit part of Italy is Lombardy, a northern region in which SARS-CoV-2 has infected thousands of patients and has been associated with a high incidence of hospitalization for intensive care and a high mortality.23 The Regional Health Authority promptly established a population-based registry of patients with a confirmed diagnosis of infection with SARS-CoV-2. Taking advantage of the regional availability of databases of health care use that cover the dispensed essential drugs and services provided to beneficiaries of the Regional Health Service (i.e., virtually all residents), we carried out a case\u2013control investigation to evaluate the association between the use of RAAS blockers and the risk of Covid-19. The analysis was extended to other antihypertensive agents as well as to a large number of other medications. Data were also analyzed according to sex, age, and the severity of Covid-19 (i.e., patients receiving intensive hospital care or who died vs. other patients with the disease).\nMethods\nTARGET POPULATION AND DATA SOURCES\nResidents in Lombardy, 40 years of age or older, who were beneficiaries of the Regional Health Service formed the target population (just over 6 million people, approximately 17% of the entire Italian population in that age group). Italian citizens have equal access to essential health care services provided by the National Health Service. In Lombardy, that association has been paired with an automated system of databases that collect a variety of information, including codes in the International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision, Clinical Modification, for inpatient diagnoses and services supplied from public or private hospitals as well as Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical codes of outpatient dispensation of drugs reimbursed to the pharmacies after filing doctors\u2019 prescriptions. These various types of data can be interconnected, since a single individual identification code is used by all databases for each citizen enrolled. To preserve privacy, each identification code was automatically deidentified, the inverse process being allowed only to the Regional Health Authority on request from judicial authorities.\nAll the authors vouch for the accuracy and completeness of the data and for the fidelity of the study to the protocol (available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org). Deidentified data were extracted and processed from the regional repository, using statistical programs developed by the authors, according to a protocol previously discussed with and approved by the Regional Health Authority. Further details of the databases of health care use in Lombardy have been reported in previous studies.24-26\nCASE PATIENTS AND CONTROLS\nSince February 21, 2020, patients with a diagnosis of Covid-19 have been revealed to the Regional Health Authority from several sources: public and private hospitals (persons seen in the first aid service for an acute respiratory infection and infected inpatients, including those who received assisted ventilation); general practitioners (symptomatic outpatients receiving only home care); municipal registries (deaths due to Covid-19); and laboratories accredited by the Regional Health Authority. Diagnosis was based on the protocol released by the World Health Organization27 \u2014 that is, positive nasopharyngeal swab specimens tested with at least two real-time reverse-transcriptase\u2013polymerase-chain-reaction assays targeting different genes (E, RdRp, and M) of SARS-Cov-2. Up to February 25, diagnostic tests were carried out in all patients with suspected cases, whereas only symptomatic patients were tested from February 26 onward.\nThe date of Covid-19 diagnosis was considered as the index date, and patient data were extracted from the registry until March 11, 2020. We excluded patients who were not beneficiaries of the Regional Health Service (361 patients); who became beneficiaries of the Regional Health Service after January 1, 2019 (8 patients); or who were younger than 40 years of age at the index date (619 patients). The remaining 6292 patients were included in the study as case patients. Among them, the 617 patients who received assisted ventilation or died were classified as having a critical or fatal infection; the remaining patients were regarded as having relatively mild-to-moderate clinical manifestations of the infection. Approximately half the patients with mild-to-moderate cases received home care, and the remaining patients were hospitalized but did not received intensive care.\nFor each case patient, up to five controls were randomly selected from the target population to be matched for sex, age at index date, and municipality of residence. Before matching, persons who became beneficiaries of the Regional Health Service after January 1, 2019, were excluded from the target population. Patients who had received a diagnosis of Covid-19 had been eligible as potential controls until they became case patients, and all matches had to be at risk for Covid-19.\nCLINICAL FEATURES AND DRUG EXPOSURE\nPrevious hospitalizations for cardiovascular disease, cancer, respiratory disease, and kidney disease in case patients and controls were traced in the regional databases for a 5-year period before the index date. In addition, case patients and controls were categorized according to the Chronic Related Score (CReSc), a new index of patients\u2019 clinical profiles derived from inpatient and outpatient services provided by the Regional Health Service and validated for outcome prediction.28 A detailed description of the CReSc, which scores the presence or absence of 31 diseases or conditions in each patient, is provided in the Supplementary Appendix, available at NEJM.org. CReSc values range from 0 to 4, with higher values indicating a worse clinical status.\nMajor classes of antihypertensive agents (ACE inhibitors, ARBs, calcium-channel blockers, diuretics [including subtypes], and beta-blockers) that were dispensed to case patients and controls during 2019 were traced from the databases of health care use. In addition to ACE inhibitors and ARBs, other drugs that were dispensed and are known to act through the RAAS were noted \u2014 renin inhibitors and sacubitril\u2013valsartan, the latter used only in heart failure. We also noted antihypertensive drugs dispensed as monotherapy and as combination therapies (typically an RAAS blocker with another agent). Other drugs that were dispensed during 2019 included lipid-lowering agents (mainly statins), oral hypoglycemic agents (noted together and as the more commonly dispensed individual classes), insulin, antiplatelet agents, antiarrhythmic agents, anticoagulant agents, digitalis, nitrates, inhaled glucocorticoids, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, immunosuppressive agents (i.e., glucocorticoids, calcineurin inhibitors, antiproliferative agents, and monoclonal antibodies), short-acting \u03b2-agonists, long-acting \u03b2-agonists, and other agents used for chronic respiratory diseases. Diagnostic, therapeutic, and procedural codes that were used for the current study are shown in Table S1 in the Supplementary Appendix.\nSTATISTICAL ANALYSIS\nThe between-group relative difference in clinical features and drug exposures was used for comparing case patients and controls. Conditional logistic-regression models were fitted for estimating the odds ratio and corresponding 95% confidence interval for the risk of Covid-19 associated with exposures of interest. Models separately included clinical features and drug exposures listed above (unadjusted models), as well as all aforementioned baseline covariates together (adjusted model). Crude and adjusted estimates were obtained for the effect of antihypertensive therapy dispensed always as monotherapy or as a combination of two or more agents, both compared with the absence of any antihypertensive drug therapy dispensed during 2019. To test the hypothesis that exposure may affect the severity of clinical manifestations of Covid-19, analyses were restricted to the stratum of patients who had a critical or fatal infection. Stratifications for sex and age categories (<60 years vs. \u226560 years) were performed as secondary analyses.\nTo verify the robustness of our findings, we performed two further analyses. First, because records of exposure to antihypertensive drugs were not available after December 2019, data were analyzed according to three criteria \u2014 any prescriptions during 2019, at least three consecutive prescriptions during 2019, and at least one prescription in the last quarter of 2019, under the assumption that the two latter criteria might identify more reliably treatment that did not change. Second, because the strategy that was used for testing for coronavirus changed during the data collection, analyses were stratified according to the date of Covid-19 diagnosis (up to February 25, 2020, vs. February 26, 2020, and after).\nResults\nCASE PATIENTS AND CONTROLS\nAmong the 6292 case patients, a control of the same sex, age, and municipality of residence could not be found for 20 persons. The remaining 6272 case patients (99.7%) who were included in the analysis were matched to 30,759 controls; the 1:5 matching was fully successful for 6015 included case patients, whereas fewer than 5 controls were available for the remaining 257 case patients (4.1%). At the index date, the mean (\u00b1SD) age of case patients and controls was 68\u00b113 years, and nearly 37% were women (matching variables).\nTable 1.\nDemographic and Clinical Characteristics of Patients with Covid-19 (Case Patients) and Matched Controls.\nTable 1 shows that ARBs and ACE inhibitors were both more frequently prescribed in case patients than in controls. The percentage of patients who received ARBs was 22.2% among case patients and 19.2% among controls (relative difference, 13.3%); the percentage of patients who received ACE inhibitors was 23.9% and 21.4%, respectively (relative difference, 10.5%). Other antihypertensive drugs were also used more in case patients than in controls, the difference usually being larger than for ACE inhibitors and ARBs, particularly for loop diuretics (13.9% vs. 7.8%; relative difference, 43.6%) and mineralocorticoid-receptor antagonists (3.8% vs. 2.4%; relative difference, 37.1%). Use of renin inhibitors (1 case patient) and sacubitril\u2013valsartan (28 case patients) was uncommon, and no further analysis of these treatments was carried out. Case patients also used a combination of antihypertensive drugs more frequently than controls, had a more frequent history of hospitalization for cardiovascular and noncardiovascular diseases, and, according to the CReSc index, had an overall substantially worse clinical profile.\nARBS, ACE INHIBITORS, AND COVID-19\nTable 2.\nOdds Ratios for Covid-19 Associated with Use of RAAS Blockers, Other Blood-Pressure\u2013Lowering Drugs, Drugs for Other Disease, and Other Features.\nTable 3.\nOdds Ratios for Covid-19 Associated with Use of Antihypertensive Drugs Dispensed as Monotherapy or Combination Therapy.\nTable 2 shows unadjusted estimates of the risk of Covid-19 according to the drugs shown in Table 1, which suggested a possible effect. However, after multivariable adjustment, neither ARBs nor ACE inhibitors had a significant association with the risk of Covid-19. This was also the case for calcium-channel blockers, beta-blockers, and diuretics. An association with Covid-19 after multivariable adjustment was maintained by loop diuretics and some other non-antihypertensive drugs (insulin, antiplatelet agents, anticoagulants, immunosuppressant drugs, and drugs used for respiratory disease). As compared with patients who did not use antihypertensive drugs during 2019, those to whom antihypertensive agents were dispensed as monotherapy or as a combination of two or more agents appeared to have a greater risk of Covid-19 in the unadjusted (crude) analysis, but after multivariable adjustment, neither monotherapy nor combination therapy showed a significant association with the risk of Covid-19 (Table 3). The multivariable adjusted risk of Covid-19 was increased in patients with previous hospitalizations for cardiovascular or noncardiovascular diseases. It also became progressively greater as the CReSc increased (Table 2).\nSUBGROUP AND SENSITIVITY ANALYSES\nTable 4.\nAdjusted Odds Ratios for Covid-19 Associated with Use of RAAS Blockers and Other Antihypertensive Drugs.\nData on the risk of Covid-19 infection associated with the use of RAAS blockers and other drugs were similar in men and in women (Table 4 and Tables S2 and S3). There was no statistical evidence that the findings obtained for the entire cohort were modified by age or the severity of the clinical manifestations and course of Covid-19 (Table 4 and Tables S3 through S5). As shown in Figure S1, the data on Covid-19 and antihypertensive drugs were consistent regardless of whether drug use was assessed through loose or more strict criteria. Furthermore, the findings did not change substantially when case patients were stratified according to the date of Covid-19 diagnosis (Table S6).\nDiscussion\nIn the present study, the use of ARBs and ACE inhibitors was more frequent among patients who were infected with SARS-CoV-2 than among the large number of controls who were matched for age, sex, and place of residence. However, all other major antihypertensive drugs, such as calcium-channel blockers, beta-blockers, and diuretics, were also used more frequently in patients with Covid-19, with differences from controls that were larger than those shown by ARBs and ACE inhibitors. Furthermore, in a multivariable analysis in which data were adjusted for a number of treatment-related covariates and markers of patient clinical status, the use of ARBs or ACE inhibitors was not significantly associated with the risk of Covid-19. Finally, there was no statistical evidence of an independent association between the use of a combination of antihypertensive drugs (in which an ACE inhibitor or an ARB is by far the most common component) and the risk of Covid-19. Thus, our results do not provide evidence of an independent relationship between RAAS blockers and the susceptibility to Covid-19 in humans.\nWe found that patients with Covid-19 had a higher baseline prevalence of cardiovascular conditions and diseases (hypertension, coronary heart disease, heart failure, and chronic kidney disease) for which treatment with the medications studied here is often used. Such observations confirm previous observations by Chinese investigators that patients with Covid-19 generally have poorer health than the general population,11-15 a conclusion that in the present study is strongly supported by the evidence that patients with Covid-19 were more frequently treated with drugs for many noncardiovascular diseases, had a higher incidence of previous hospitalizations for a variety of causes, and had higher scores for chronic coexisting conditions than controls.6,29,30\nThe present study provides several additional findings. First, the conclusion that RAAS blockers do not modify susceptibility to Covid-19 applies to both sexes as well as to younger and older persons. Second, our data provide no evidence that, rather than modifying the susceptibility to Covid-19, RAAS blockers alter the evolution of the disease, thereby mainly affecting its severity. In our study, neither ACE inhibitors nor ARBs showed an independent association with Covid-19 in patients with mild-to-moderate disease or in those with severe disease. Third, patients with Covid-19 had much more frequent use of loop diuretics and mineralocorticoid-receptor antagonists than controls, and treatment with loop diuretics was associated with an increased risk of Covid-19 in the multivariable analysis. Rather than suggesting an association (for which there is no mechanistic support), this finding is likely to mean that use of loop diuretics reflects the existence of clinical conditions such as heart failure or advanced renal damage, the severity of which was not appropriately quantified by the available clinical data and scores. These observations from our study may account for the independent relationship that was found between Covid-19 and some noncardiovascular drugs, although more direct investigations with appropriate experimental designs would be required to clarify this issue.\nOne strength of the study is the large number of case patients as well as the inclusion of a large and well-matched control group, without which interpretation of the collected data would have been difficult. It is also a strength that the Lombardy database included previous hospitalizations and allowed the drugs prescribed to outpatients to be accurately observed, because pharmacists must file outpatient prescriptions to claim reimbursement, and incorrect reports carry legal consequences.\nLimitations of the study include the fact that information on drug use is limited to prescriptions, and actual drug consumption by the case patients and controls could not be assessed. Drugs that were purchased by the patients (because doctors prescribed them privately, and no records were in the National Health Service system) as well as those dispensed after December 31, 2019, were not captured by our analysis. However, the availability of free antihypertensive agents makes out-of-pocket purchase of these drugs rare, and an exploratory analysis involving patients in whom antihypertensive treatment had been taken regularly or closer to the time of infection did not modify the results. Our results reflect the doses of RAAS blockers used in Italian medical practice but did not allow us to investigate other doses, because this information was not included in the database. It is likely that the control group included some persons with Covid-19, since the general population in Italy was not tested. Unmeasured confounders may have been responsible for our findings. For example, given the hypothesis that RAAS blockers increase the risk of severe clinical manifestations of Covid-19, there may have been preferential dispensation of RAAS blockers to patients with better clinical profiles and a lower perceived likelihood of the development of severe Covid-19. However, there was no evidence that patients who received ARBs or ACE inhibitors had a better clinical profile than those who received other antihypertensive medications. Finally, our results apply to a largely white population and cannot be generalized to other races.\nThe present study does not provide evidence that the use of ACE inhibitors or ARBs is independently associated with the risk of Covid-19.\nDisclosure forms provided by the authors are available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org.\nThis article was published on May 1, 2020, at NEJM.org.\nA data sharing statement provided by the authors is available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org.\nWe thank Dr. Roberto Blaco, head of the Epidemiologic Observatory of Lombardy Region, for designing and managing the population-based Covid-19 registry and for making data available for the current study.\nAuthor Affiliations\nFrom the University of Milano\u2013Bicocca (G.M.), the National Center of Healthcare Research and Pharmacoepidemiology (F.R., G.C.) and the Unit of Biostatistics, Epidemiology, and Public Health, Department of Statistics and Quantitative Methods (F.R., G.C.), University of Milano\u2013Bicocca, Azienda Regionale per l\u2019Innovazione e gli Acquisti (M.L.), and Fondazione IRCCS Istituto Nazionale dei Tumori (G.A.), Milan, and Policlinico di Monza, Monza (G.M.) \u2014 all in Italy.\nAddress reprint requests to Dr. Corrao at the Department of Statistics and Quantitative Methods, Universit\u00e0 degli Studi di Milano\u2013Bicocca, Via Bicocca degli Arcimboldi, 8, Edificio U7, 20126 Milan, Italy, or at giovanni.corrao@unimib.it.\nSupplementary Material\nProtocol PDF 391KB\nSupplementary Appendix PDF 605KB\nDisclosure Forms PDF 195KB\nData Sharing Statement PDF 69KB\nReferences (30)\nCiting Article (1)", "10.1056/NEJMoa2002032": "24 References\n699 Citing Articles\nLetters\nAbstract\nBACKGROUND\nSince December 2019, when coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) emerged in Wuhan city and rapidly spread throughout China, data have been needed on the clinical characteristics of the affected patients.\nMETHODS\nWe extracted data regarding 1099 patients with laboratory-confirmed Covid-19 from 552 hospitals in 30 provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities in mainland China through January 29, 2020. The primary composite end point was admission to an intensive care unit (ICU), the use of mechanical ventilation, or death.\nRESULTS\nThe median age of the patients was 47 years; 41.9% of the patients were female. The primary composite end point occurred in 67 patients (6.1%), including 5.0% who were admitted to the ICU, 2.3% who underwent invasive mechanical ventilation, and 1.4% who died. Only 1.9% of the patients had a history of direct contact with wildlife. Among nonresidents of Wuhan, 72.3% had contact with residents of Wuhan, including 31.3% who had visited the city. The most common symptoms were fever (43.8% on admission and 88.7% during hospitalization) and cough (67.8%). Diarrhea was uncommon (3.8%). The median incubation period was 4 days (interquartile range, 2 to 7). On admission, ground-glass opacity was the most common radiologic finding on chest computed tomography (CT) (56.4%). No radiographic or CT abnormality was found in 157 of 877 patients (17.9%) with nonsevere disease and in 5 of 173 patients (2.9%) with severe disease. Lymphocytopenia was present in 83.2% of the patients on admission.\nCONCLUSIONS\nDuring the first 2 months of the current outbreak, Covid-19 spread rapidly throughout China and caused varying degrees of illness. Patients often presented without fever, and many did not have abnormal radiologic findings. (Funded by the National Health Commission of China and others.)\nQUICK TAKE\n\nClinical Characteristics of Covid-19\n\n 02:08\nIn early December 2019, the first pneumonia cases of unknown origin were identified in Wuhan, the capital city of Hubei province.1 The pathogen has been identified as a novel enveloped RNA betacoronavirus2 that has currently been named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which has a phylogenetic similarity to SARS-CoV.3 Patients with the infection have been documented both in hospitals and in family settings.4-8\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) has recently declared coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) a public health emergency of international concern.9 As of February 25, 2020, a total of 81,109 laboratory-confirmed cases had been documented globally.5,6,9-11 In recent studies, the severity of some cases of Covid-19 mimicked that of SARS-CoV.1,12,13 Given the rapid spread of Covid-19, we determined that an updated analysis of cases throughout mainland China might help identify the defining clinical characteristics and severity of the disease. Here, we describe the results of our analysis of the clinical characteristics of Covid-19 in a selected cohort of patients throughout China.\nMethods\nSTUDY OVERSIGHT\nThe study was supported by National Health Commission of China and designed by the investigators. The study was approved by the institutional review board of the National Health Commission. Written informed consent was waived in light of the urgent need to collect data. Data were analyzed and interpreted by the authors. All the authors reviewed the manuscript and vouch for the accuracy and completeness of the data and for the adherence of the study to the protocol, available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org.\nDATA SOURCES\nWe obtained the medical records and compiled data for hospitalized patients and outpatients with laboratory-confirmed Covid-19, as reported to the National Health Commission between December 11, 2019, and January 29, 2020; the data cutoff for the study was January 31, 2020. Covid-19 was diagnosed on the basis of the WHO interim guidance.14 A confirmed case of Covid-19 was defined as a positive result on high-throughput sequencing or real-time reverse-transcriptase\u2013polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR) assay of nasal and pharyngeal swab specimens.1 Only laboratory-confirmed cases were included in the analysis.\nWe obtained data regarding cases outside Hubei province from the National Health Commission. Because of the high workload of clinicians, three outside experts from Guangzhou performed raw data extraction at Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital, where many of the patients with Covid-19 in Wuhan were being treated.\nWe extracted the recent exposure history, clinical symptoms or signs, and laboratory findings on admission from electronic medical records. Radiologic assessments included chest radiography or computed tomography (CT), and all laboratory testing was performed according to the clinical care needs of the patient. We determined the presence of a radiologic abnormality on the basis of the documentation or description in medical charts; if imaging scans were available, they were reviewed by attending physicians in respiratory medicine who extracted the data. Major disagreement between two reviewers was resolved by consultation with a third reviewer. Laboratory assessments consisted of a complete blood count, blood chemical analysis, coagulation testing, assessment of liver and renal function, and measures of electrolytes, C-reactive protein, procalcitonin, lactate dehydrogenase, and creatine kinase. We defined the degree of severity of Covid-19 (severe vs. nonsevere) at the time of admission using the American Thoracic Society guidelines for community-acquired pneumonia.15\nAll medical records were copied and sent to the data-processing center in Guangzhou, under the coordination of the National Health Commission. A team of experienced respiratory clinicians reviewed and abstracted the data. Data were entered into a computerized database and cross-checked. If the core data were missing, requests for clarification were sent to the coordinators, who subsequently contacted the attending clinicians.\nSTUDY OUTCOMES\nThe primary composite end point was admission to an intensive care unit (ICU), the use of mechanical ventilation, or death. These outcomes were used in a previous study to assess the severity of other serious infectious diseases, such as H7N9 infection.16 Secondary end points were the rate of death and the time from symptom onset until the composite end point and until each component of the composite end point.\nSTUDY DEFINITIONS\nThe incubation period was defined as the interval between the potential earliest date of contact of the transmission source (wildlife or person with suspected or confirmed case) and the potential earliest date of symptom onset (i.e., cough, fever, fatigue, or myalgia). We excluded incubation periods of less than 1 day because some patients had continuous exposure to contamination sources; in these cases, the latest date of exposure was recorded. The summary statistics of incubation periods were calculated on the basis of 291 patients who had clear information regarding the specific date of exposure.\nFever was defined as an axillary temperature of 37.5\u00b0C or higher. Lymphocytopenia was defined as a lymphocyte count of less than 1500 cells per cubic millimeter. Thrombocytopenia was defined as a platelet count of less than 150,000 per cubic millimeter. Additional definitions \u2014 including exposure to wildlife, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), pneumonia, acute kidney failure, acute heart failure, and rhabdomyolysis \u2014 are provided in the Supplementary Appendix, available at NEJM.org.\nLABORATORY CONFIRMATION\nLaboratory confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 was performed at the Chinese Center for Disease Prevention and Control before January 23, 2020, and subsequently in certified tertiary care hospitals. RT-PCR assays were performed in accordance with the protocol established by the WHO.17 Details regarding laboratory confirmation processes are provided in the Supplementary Appendix.\nSTATISTICAL ANALYSIS\nContinuous variables were expressed as medians and interquartile ranges or simple ranges, as appropriate. Categorical variables were summarized as counts and percentages. No imputation was made for missing data. Because the cohort of patients in our study was not derived from random selection, all statistics are deemed to be descriptive only. We used ArcGIS, version 10.2.2, to plot the numbers of patients with reportedly confirmed cases on a map. All the analyses were performed with the use of R software, version 3.6.2 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing).\nResults\nDEMOGRAPHIC AND CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS\nFigure 1.\nDistribution of Patients with Covid-19 across Mainland China.\nOf the 7736 patients with Covid-19 who had been hospitalized at 552 sites as of January 29, 2020, we obtained data regarding clinical symptoms and outcomes for 1099 patients (14.2%). The largest number of patients (132) had been admitted to Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital. The hospitals that were included in this study accounted for 29.7% of the 1856 designated hospitals where patients with Covid-19 could be admitted in 30 provinces, autonomous regions, or municipalities across China (Figure 1).\nTable 1.\nClinical Characteristics of the Study Patients, According to Disease Severity and the Presence or Absence of the Primary Composite End Point.\nThe demographic and clinical characteristics of the patients are shown in Table 1. A total of 3.5% were health care workers, and a history of contact with wildlife was documented in 1.9%; 483 patients (43.9%) were residents of Wuhan. Among the patients who lived outside Wuhan, 72.3% had contact with residents of Wuhan, including 31.3% who had visited the city; 25.9% of nonresidents had neither visited the city nor had contact with Wuhan residents.\nThe median incubation period was 4 days (interquartile range, 2 to 7). The median age of the patients was 47 years (interquartile range, 35 to 58); 0.9% of the patients were younger than 15 years of age. A total of 41.9% were female. Fever was present in 43.8% of the patients on admission but developed in 88.7% during hospitalization. The second most common symptom was cough (67.8%); nausea or vomiting (5.0%) and diarrhea (3.8%) were uncommon. Among the overall population, 23.7% had at least one coexisting illness (e.g., hypertension and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease).\nOn admission, the degree of severity of Covid-19 was categorized as nonsevere in 926 patients and severe in 173 patients. Patients with severe disease were older than those with nonsevere disease by a median of 7 years. Moreover, the presence of any coexisting illness was more common among patients with severe disease than among those with nonsevere disease (38.7% vs. 21.0%). However, the exposure history between the two groups of disease severity was similar.\nRADIOLOGIC AND LABORATORY FINDINGS\nTable 2.\nRadiographic and Laboratory Findings.\nTable 2 shows the radiologic and laboratory findings on admission. Of 975 CT scans that were performed at the time of admission, 86.2% revealed abnormal results. The most common patterns on chest CT were ground-glass opacity (56.4%) and bilateral patchy shadowing (51.8%). Representative radiologic findings in two patients with nonsevere Covid-19 and in another two patients with severe Covid-19 are provided in Figure S1 in the Supplementary Appendix. No radiographic or CT abnormality was found in 157 of 877 patients (17.9%) with nonsevere disease and in 5 of 173 patients (2.9%) with severe disease.\nOn admission, lymphocytopenia was present in 83.2% of the patients, thrombocytopenia in 36.2%, and leukopenia in 33.7%. Most of the patients had elevated levels of C-reactive protein; less common were elevated levels of alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, creatine kinase, and d-dimer. Patients with severe disease had more prominent laboratory abnormalities (including lymphocytopenia and leukopenia) than those with nonsevere disease.\nCLINICAL OUTCOMES\nTable 3.\nComplications, Treatments, and Clinical Outcomes.\nNone of the 1099 patients were lost to follow-up during the study. A primary composite end-point event occurred in 67 patients (6.1%), including 5.0% who were admitted to the ICU, 2.3% who underwent invasive mechanical ventilation, and 1.4% who died (Table 3). Among the 173 patients with severe disease, a primary composite end-point event occurred in 43 patients (24.9%). Among all the patients, the cumulative risk of the composite end point was 3.6%; among those with severe disease, the cumulative risk was 20.6%.\nTREATMENT AND COMPLICATIONS\nA majority of the patients (58.0%) received intravenous antibiotic therapy, and 35.8% received oseltamivir therapy; oxygen therapy was administered in 41.3% and mechanical ventilation in 6.1%; higher percentages of patients with severe disease received these therapies (Table 3). Mechanical ventilation was initiated in more patients with severe disease than in those with nonsevere disease (noninvasive ventilation, 32.4% vs. 0%; invasive ventilation, 14.5% vs. 0%). Systemic glucocorticoids were given to 204 patients (18.6%), with a higher percentage among those with severe disease than nonsevere disease (44.5% vs. 13.7%). Of these 204 patients, 33 (16.2%) were admitted to the ICU, 17 (8.3%) underwent invasive ventilation, and 5 (2.5%) died. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation was performed in 5 patients (0.5%) with severe disease.\nThe median duration of hospitalization was 12.0 days (mean, 12.8). During hospital admission, most of the patients received a diagnosis of pneumonia from a physician (91.1%), followed by ARDS (3.4%) and shock (1.1%). Patients with severe disease had a higher incidence of physician-diagnosed pneumonia than those with nonsevere disease (99.4% vs. 89.5%).\nDiscussion\nDuring the initial phase of the Covid-19 outbreak, the diagnosis of the disease was complicated by the diversity in symptoms and imaging findings and in the severity of disease at the time of presentation. Fever was identified in 43.8% of the patients on presentation but developed in 88.7% after hospitalization. Severe illness occurred in 15.7% of the patients after admission to a hospital. No radiologic abnormalities were noted on initial presentation in 2.9% of the patients with severe disease and in 17.9% of those with nonsevere disease. Despite the number of deaths associated with Covid-19, SARS-CoV-2 appears to have a lower case fatality rate than either SARS-CoV or Middle East respiratory syndrome\u2013related coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Compromised respiratory status on admission (the primary driver of disease severity) was associated with worse outcomes.\nApproximately 2% of the patients had a history of direct contact with wildlife, whereas more than three quarters were either residents of Wuhan, had visited the city, or had contact with city residents. These findings echo the latest reports, including the outbreak of a family cluster,4 transmission from an asymptomatic patient,6 and the three-phase outbreak patterns.8 Our study cannot preclude the presence of patients who have been termed \u201csuper-spreaders.\u201d\nConventional routes of transmission of SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and highly pathogenic influenza consist of respiratory droplets and direct contact,18-20 mechanisms that probably occur with SARS-CoV-2 as well. Because SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in the gastrointestinal tract, saliva, and urine, these routes of potential transmission need to be investigated21 (Tables S1 and S2).\nThe term Covid-19 has been applied to patients who have laboratory-confirmed symptomatic cases without apparent radiologic manifestations. A better understanding of the spectrum of the disease is needed, since in 8.9% of the patients, SARS-CoV-2 infection was detected before the development of viral pneumonia or viral pneumonia did not develop.\nIn concert with recent studies,1,8,12 we found that the clinical characteristics of Covid-19 mimic those of SARS-CoV. Fever and cough were the dominant symptoms and gastrointestinal symptoms were uncommon, which suggests a difference in viral tropism as compared with SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and seasonal influenza.22,23 The absence of fever in Covid-19 is more frequent than in SARS-CoV (1%) and MERS-CoV infection (2%),20 so afebrile patients may be missed if the surveillance case definition focuses on fever detection.14 Lymphocytopenia was common and, in some cases, severe, a finding that was consistent with the results of two recent reports.1,12 We found a lower case fatality rate (1.4%) than the rate that was recently reportedly,1,12 probably because of the difference in sample sizes and case inclusion criteria. Our findings were more similar to the national official statistics, which showed a rate of death of 3.2% among 51,857 cases of Covid-19 as of February 16, 2020.11,24 Since patients who were mildly ill and who did not seek medical attention were not included in our study, the case fatality rate in a real-world scenario might be even lower. Early isolation, early diagnosis, and early management might have collectively contributed to the reduction in mortality in Guangdong.\nDespite the phylogenetic homogeneity between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV, there are some clinical characteristics that differentiate Covid-19 from SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and seasonal influenza infections. (For example, seasonal influenza has been more common in respiratory outpatient clinics and wards.) Some additional characteristics that are unique to Covid-19 are detailed in Table S3.\nOur study has some notable limitations. First, some cases had incomplete documentation of the exposure history and laboratory testing, given the variation in the structure of electronic databases among different participating sites and the urgent timeline for data extraction. Some cases were diagnosed in outpatient settings where medical information was briefly documented and incomplete laboratory testing was performed, along with a shortage of infrastructure and training of medical staff in nonspecialty hospitals. Second, we could estimate the incubation period in only 291 of the study patients who had documented information. The uncertainty of the exact dates (recall bias) might have inevitably affected our assessment. Third, because many patients remained in the hospital and the outcomes were unknown at the time of data cutoff, we censored the data regarding their clinical outcomes as of the time of our analysis. Fourth, we no doubt missed patients who were asymptomatic or had mild cases and who were treated at home, so our study cohort may represent the more severe end of Covid-19. Fifth, many patients did not undergo sputum bacteriologic or fungal assessment on admission because, in some hospitals, medical resources were overwhelmed. Sixth, data generation was clinically driven and not systematic.\nCovid-19 has spread rapidly since it was first identified in Wuhan and has been shown to have a wide spectrum of severity. Some patients with Covid-19 do not have fever or radiologic abnormalities on initial presentation, which has complicated the diagnosis.\nSupported by the National Health Commission of China, the National Natural Science Foundation, and the Department of Science and Technology of Guangdong Province.\nDisclosure forms provided by the authors are available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org.\nDrs.

Clinical data were obtained through review of medical records. The data reported here are those available through March 23, 2020. Each patient had at least 14 days of follow-up.\nRESULTS\nWe identified 24 patients with confirmed Covid-19. The mean (\u00b1SD) age of the patients was 64\u00b118 years, 63% were men, and symptoms began 7\u00b14 days before admission. The most common symptoms were cough and shortness of breath; 50% of patients had fever on admission, and 58% had diabetes mellitus. All the patients were admitted for hypoxemic respiratory failure; 75% (18 patients) needed mechanical ventilation. Most of the patients (17) also had hypotension and needed vasopressors. No patient tested positive for influenza A, influenza B, or other respiratory viruses. Half the patients (12) died between ICU day 1 and day 18, including 4 patients who had a do-not-resuscitate order on admission. Of the 12 surviving patients, 5 were discharged home, 4 were discharged from the ICU but remained in the hospital, and 3 continued to receive mechanical ventilation in the ICU.\nCONCLUSIONS\nDuring the first 3 weeks of the Covid-19 outbreak in the Seattle area, the most common reasons for admission to the ICU were hypoxemic respiratory failure leading to mechanical ventilation, hypotension requiring vasopressor treatment, or both. Mortality among these critically ill patients was high.

(00:07)\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the novel coronavirus first detected in Wuhan, China, that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19).1 Since initial detection of the virus, more than 400,000 cases of Covid-19 have been confirmed worldwide, with the first reported cases in the United States occurring on January 19, 2020, in the state of Washington.2,3 The number of cases in Washington continues to rise; as of March 27, 2020, there had been 3700 confirmed Covid-19 cases and 175 deaths.4 Most of the cases have been in King County, an urban county that includes Seattle and outlying suburbs and accounts for 1760 Covid-19 cases and 125 deaths. Genomic and epidemiologic analyses of sequenced virus RNA recovered in the western Washington region5 have shown that the spread of SARS-CoV-2 has been the result of local community transmission \u2014 meaning that the source of infection cannot be traced back to a known exposure. Person-to-person transmission has also been well documented in skilled nursing and long-term care facilities in the Seattle metropolitan area.\nInitial reports from China and Italy suggest high mortality and stressed intensive care unit (ICU) capacity.6,7 Reports describing patients admitted to the ICU with Covid-19 in the United States are limited.8 A better characterization of Covid-19 infection in critically ill patients is important to guide decision making regarding critical care capacity and allocation of resources.9 The aim of our multicenter report is to describe the demographic characteristics, coexisting conditions, imaging findings, and outcomes among critically ill patients with Covid-19 in the Seattle metropolitan area.\nMethods\nSTUDY POPULATION, SETTING, AND DATA COLLECTION\nWe included patients with laboratory-confirmed Covid-19 infection who were admitted to nine hospital ICUs in the Seattle region between February 24 and March 9, 2020. A confirmed case of Covid-19 was defined by a positive result on a reverse-transcriptase\u2013polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR) assay of a specimen collected on a nasopharyngeal swab. Only laboratory-confirmed cases were included.\nTwenty-four adults (18 years of age or older) were identified from nine hospitals, including three University of Washington (UW) Medicine Hospitals (Harborview Medical Center, UW Medical Center\u2013Montlake, and Northwest campuses), the Virginia Mason Medical Center, and the Swedish Hospitals (First Hill and Cherry Hill). This group represents six of the eight adult acute care hospitals in the city of Seattle; hospitals connected to these systems in suburbs outside Seattle (UW\u2013Valley Medical Center, Swedish\u2013Issaquah, and Swedish\u2013Edmonds) were also included in the group of nine. Pregnant women, prisoners, and children (those younger than 18 years of age) were excluded from the study. The UW institutional review board approved this study with the reliance agreement (also known as an authorization agreement) of other local medical centers. The institutional review board at Swedish Medical Center also independently approved the study. Informed consent was waived, and researchers analyzed only deidentified (anonymized) data.\nData from each institution\u2019s electronic medical record was obtained through a research form in Research Electronic Data Capture software (REDCap, Vanderbilt University). We obtained demographic data, information on clinical symptoms or signs at presentation, and laboratory and radiologic results during ICU admission. All laboratory tests and radiologic assessments, including plain chest radiography and computed tomography of the chest, were performed at the discretion of the treating physician.\nSTUDY DEFINITIONS\nCoexisting conditions were ascertained from physician documentation. Patient data were censored at the time of data cutoff, which occurred on March 23, 2020. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) was defined as acute-onset hypoxemia (the ratio of the partial pressure of arterial oxygen to the fraction of inspired oxygen [Pao2:Fio2], <300) with bilateral pulmonary opacities on chest imaging that were not fully explained by congestive heart failure or other forms of volume overload.10\nSPECIMEN COLLECTION AND TESTING\nClinical specimens for Covid-19 diagnostic testing were obtained in accordance with Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines. Initially, all clinical specimens were tested with the assay developed by the CDC, targeting the N1 and N2 genes,11 which was run at the Washington Department of Health State Public Health Laboratory. On March 2, UW began using an assay developed by the UW School of Medicine clinical virology laboratory (see the Methods section in the Supplementary Appendix, available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org). The assay is based on the World Health Organization standard, and it targets the SARS-CoV-2 E gene and RdRp gene.12 If both targets are detected, the assay is reported as positive; if one target is detected, the assay is reported as inconclusive and is later confirmed reflexively by the real-time RT-PCR assay developed by the CDC at the Washington State Public Health Laboratory.\nSTATISTICAL ANALYSIS\nDescriptive statistics were used to summarize the data; results are reported as medians and interquartile ranges or means and standard deviations, as appropriate. Categorical variables were summarized as counts and percentages. No imputation was made for missing data. Analysis was performed with Stata 15.1 software (StataCorp).\nResults\nDEMOGRAPHIC AND CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS OF THE PATIENTS\nTable 1.\nClinical Characteristics of the Patients at Baseline.\nDuring the period from February 24 through March 9, we identified 24 critically ill patients with confirmed Covid-19 infection at the nine hospitals surveyed. This number included all patients admitted to the ICU under the care of an intensivist at any time during the hospital stay. The demographic and clinical characteristics of the patients are shown in Table 1. The mean (\u00b1SD) age of the patients was 64\u00b118 years (range, 23 to 97); 63% were men. The mean duration of symptoms before hospital admission was 7\u00b14 days. None of the patients had recently traveled to a country with known transmission, such as China, South Korea, Iran, or Italy. A slight majority of patients (13 [54%]) had had recent contact with a person known to have been ill, but whether the sick contacts were infected with SARS-CoV-2 was not known because of the limited availability of testing at the time. Sixteen patients (67%) were admitted from home, and 6 patients (25%) were admitted from a skilled nursing facility. The most common symptoms on admission to the hospital were shortness of breath and cough, each of which occurred in 21 patients (88%). Documented fever was present in 12 patients (50%) on presentation at the hospital. Patient-level data are available in the Supplementary Appendix.\nChronic medical conditions were common in this critically ill population. Fourteen patients (58%) had diabetes mellitus and 5 (21%) had chronic kidney disease; 3 patients (14%) had asthma, and all 3 had recently received, as an outpatient, systemic glucocorticoids for a presumed asthma exacerbation before becoming critically ill. Five patients (22%) were current or former smokers and 1 patient (4%) had chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; 8 patients (33%) had more than one coexisting condition.\nLABORATORY AND RADIOLOGIC FINDINGS\nTable 2.\nLaboratory Data at Hospital Admission and Imaging Findings.\nTable 2 shows the laboratory and radiologic findings in the patients on admission and during the ICU course. On admission, lymphocytopenia was common (in 75% of the patients), with a median lymphocyte count of 720 per cubic millimeter (interquartile range, 520 to 1375). Arterial lactate was 1.5 mg per deciliter or higher in 8 patients, and hepatic enzymes were 40 U per liter or higher in 9 patients. Troponin concentrations were elevated in 2 patients early in their ICU course (maximum value, 0.80 ng per deciliter).\nFigure 1.\nChest Radiographs and CT Images of a 55-Year-Old Patient with SARS-CoV-2.\nA chest radiograph was obtained in 23 patients (96%) on ICU admission, and all the radiographs showed bilateral pulmonary opacities. No pleural effusions were seen. A computed tomographic (CT) scan of the chest was obtained in 5 patients (21%); four of the scans showed bilateral ground glass opacities, and one showed pulmonary nodules. Figure 1 provides representative images from a single patient, illustrating the rapid evolution of pulmonary opacities and the diffuse findings. A video showing the CT cross-sectional images of the chest is available at NEJM.org.\nMICROBIOLOGIC RESULTS\nThe performance of the local UW assay was similar to that of the CDC assay in comparison diagnostic testing. All patients had Covid-19 confirmed by an RT-PCR assay of a nasal swab. The UW assay returned one inconclusive result that was later confirmed as positive by the Washington State Public Health Laboratory.\nOf the patients with laboratory-confirmed Covid-19, nearly all (23 patients [96%]) also had nasopharyngeal swabs sent to test for influenza and respiratory syncytial virus, and 21 patients (88%) had an extended-spectrum respiratory viral panel. None of the patients had a coinfection with another virus (see Table S1 in the Supplementary Appendix). Sputum samples from 15 patients were sent for bacterial culture, and all were negative for bacterial growth; blood samples from 20 patients were sent, and all remained negative. Bronchoscopy was performed in 4 patients. Two patients had bronchoscopy performed before diagnosis of Covid-19; bacterial and viral RT-PCR results were negative for other respiratory viruses. Two subjects had bronchoscopy performed late in the hospitalization for mucous plugging, without additional cultures.\nRESPIRATORY FAILURE AND SHOCK\nTable 3.\nICU-Level Therapies and Clinical Outcomes.\nEighteen patients (75%) received invasive mechanical ventilation (Table 3). For patients who received mechanical ventilation, the Pao2:Fio2 ratios were consistent with moderate-to-severe ARDS. Pulmonary secretions were characterized as either moderate or thick and purulent in 14 patients (77%) during the first 7 days of mechanical ventilation. The median Fio2 on day 1 of mechanical ventilation was 0.9 (interquartile range, 0.7 to 1.0), and the Fio2 improved on day 3 to 0.6 (interquartile range, 0.5 to 0.7). The median driving pressure (the difference between plateau pressure and positive end expiratory pressure [PEEP]) on day 1 of mechanical ventilation was 13 cm of water (interquartile range, 11 to 17). During the first 3 days of mechanical ventilation, the median driving pressure was 12 to 13 cm of water. The median pulmonary compliance on day 1 was 29 ml per cm of water (interquartile range, 25 to 36). The pulmonary compliance improved during the first 3 days of mechanical ventilation, with median compliance on day 3 of 37 ml per cm of water (interquartile range, 25 to 42). Five patients (28%) were placed in a prone position, 7 (39%) received neuromuscular blockade, and 5 (28%) received inhaled pulmonary vasodilators to treat hypoxemic respiratory failure in ARDS. Tracheostomy was not completed in any of the patients.\nSeventeen patients (71%) presented with concurrent hypotension requiring vasopressors, without clear evidence of secondary infection. Of these patients, 3 (18%) had transient hypotension after intubation; 14 (82%) had hypotension that was unrelated to intubation or that persisted for more than 12 hours after intubation. None of the echocardiograms completed in 9 patients (38%) showed new cardiac dysfunction. Seven patients received compassionate-use remdesivir as antiviral therapy, 1 patient received hydroxychloroquine, and 1 patient received lopinavir\u2013ritonavir; no patient received systemic glucocorticoids or tocilizumab in the ICU.\nOUTCOMES\nFigure 2.\nOutcomes for Individual Patients Included in the Case Series.\nAll patients had at least 14 days of hospital follow-up. As of March 23, of the 24 patients, 12 (50%) had died, 4 (17%) had been discharged from the ICU but remained in the hospital, 3 (13%) were receiving mechanical ventilation and were still in the ICU, and 5 (21%) had been discharged from the hospital (Figure 2). A greater percentage of patients over 65 years of age had died than patients under 65 years of age (62% vs. 37%). The 12 deaths included 4 patients (17%) who had do-not-resuscitate orders in place before hospital admission for use in the event of cardiac arrest, and 6 additional patients (25%) had do-not-resuscitate orders that were instituted during their admission.\nThe median length of hospital stay among survivors was 17 days (interquartile range, 16 to 23), and the median length of ICU stay among survivors was 14 days (interquartile range, 4 to 17) (Table 3). The median duration of mechanical ventilation was 10 days (interquartile range, 7 to 12), and 6 patients (33%) had been extubated as of March 23, 2020. Three patients continued to receive ventilatory support, so the durations of mechanical ventilation and ICU stay are likely to be underestimates.\nDiscussion\nThis multicenter case series describes 24 critically ill patients who presented with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure and laboratory-confirmed Covid-19 infection. We included all patients with Covid-19 who were admitted to an ICU at nine Seattle-area hospitals between February 24 and March 9, 2020. All the patients had acquired Covid-19 without known exposure to a returning traveler. Coexisting lower respiratory bacterial infections were not identified in sputum and blood cultures obtained early in the clinical course. Overall outcomes were poor in patients who received ICU care.\nThe patients in our series presented with respiratory symptoms similar to those of patients described in reports from China, which indicates a common host response to SARS-CoV-2. Cough was the most common presenting symptom, as it was in reports from China, and the mean duration of symptoms before ICU admission was 1 week.13 Only half the patients had fever at the time of hospital admission, which suggests that fever may not be a useful criterion to determine the severity of illness and that diagnostic algorithms that require fever for Covid-19 testing may delay diagnosis. The majority of patients had chronic illnesses before their admission to the ICU, most commonly diabetes mellitus and chronic kidney disease. Lymphocytopenia was common on hospital admission, as it was in reports from China.13\nThe case fatality rate of 50% in this series (to date) is similar to that reported among critically ill patients in Chinese hospitals but lower than that in a single-center experience reported from our area.8,13 Although the case fatality rate was higher in persons 65 years of age or older, it was still substantial (37%) in persons younger than 65 years of age. Our case fatality rate may be an underestimate, given that 3 patients remained intubated at the time data were censored.\nPatients who received mechanical ventilation had high oxygen requirements soon after initiation of mechanical ventilation, with plateau pressures (mean, 25 cm of water) and driving pressures (mean, 12 to 13 cm of water) similar to those in populations of patients with ARDS enrolled in clinical trials.14,15 For example, the mean plateau pressure in the Reevaluation of Systemic Early Neuromuscular Blockade (ROSE) trial14 was 25 to 26 cm of water. Of the 18 patients who received invasive mechanical ventilation in this series, 6 had been successfully extubated. The earliest extubation occurred 8 days after initiation of invasive mechanical ventilation, which suggests that acute respiratory failure due to Covid-19 may require prolonged mechanical ventilation lasting days to weeks and that readiness for extubation is unlikely to occur early in patients receiving mechanical ventilation. Of patients who were extubated, the age range was 23 to 88 years, which suggests that age may not be the sole indicator for successful extubation.\nA large proportion of patients in this series presented with shock that required vasopressor support. In patients who had an echocardiogram, myocardial dysfunction was uncommon. The lack of bacterial or viral coinfection suggests that the observed shock was directly related to Covid-19. In these preliminary data, Covid-19 infection appears to differ from seasonal influenza, which is commonly associated with bacterial coinfection due to pathogens that colonize the nasopharynx, such as staphylococcus and streptococcus.16 Regarding antiviral interventions, 7 patients received compassionate-use remdesivir, but we have insufficient information to report associated outcomes. Bronchoscopy was performed in a minority of patients and did not appear to change clinical management.\nThree patients with mild asthma had received systemic glucocorticoids within 1 week before ICU admission, as outpatients, for presumed asthma exacerbation while they had symptoms of Covid-19. These 3 patients then presented to the hospital again, with severe respiratory failure requiring invasive mechanical ventilation. Previous studies have shown that glucocorticoid treatment for phylogenetically similar viruses, SARS-CoV (2003) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), was associated with a higher subsequent plasma viral load, longer duration of viremia, and worse clinical outcomes.17-20 These findings are in contrast to those of a recent nonrandomized observational study that suggested that glucocorticoids may be associated with improved clinical outcomes in patients with Covid-19 and ARDS.21 Further research is necessary to determine the role of systemic glucocorticoids in patients with Covid-19 infection.\nOur study has several notable limitations. First, some cases had incomplete documentation of clinical symptoms, missing laboratory testing, or both. However, given the need to provide objective data and the urgent timeline, we did not approach patients to obtain additional history or biologic samples for laboratory measurement. Second, 7 patients (29%) remained in hospitals at the time of data censoring on March 23, 2020; as a result, outcomes for those patients were not known. Third, because of our focus on the critical care needs of patients with the greatest severity of illness, our sample size is small. Finally, it is possible that critically ill patients with established goals of care that were not consistent with admission to an ICU were not included in this report. Specifically, this includes patients who received care on the general medical ward that focused on comfort measures only.\nThis early experience of the Covid-19 pandemic in the United States resembles the experience in other countries, with high mortality for patients requiring care in the ICU. Patients with coexisting conditions and older age are at risk for severe disease and poor outcomes after ICU admission. Better information is needed to inform care for these challenging patients. Our findings also highlight the importance of planning for mass critical care as the need for ICU care and ventilatory support to treat patients with Covid-19 grows rapidly in the United States.22,23\nSupported by a grant from the National Institutes of Health (K23DK116967, to Dr. Bhatraju).\nDisclosure forms provided by the authors are available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org.\nThis article was published on March 30, 2020, at NEJM.org.\nA data sharing statement provided by the authors is available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org.\nWe thank Adrienne Meyer from the University of Washington institutional review board for rapidly reviewing and facilitating study protocols across many area hospitals.\nAuthor Affiliations\nFrom the Division of Pulmonary, Critical Care and Sleep Medicine, Department of Medicine (P.K.B., B.J.G., M.N., R.K., M.M.W., L.E., P.A.K., T.E.W., A.L., C.M.), the Departments of Laboratory Medicine (K.R.J., A.K.N., A.L.G.) and Radiology (S.P.), and the Division of Allergy and Infectious Disease (J.D.G.), University of Washington, the Vaccine and Infectious Disease Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center (K.R.J., A.K.N., A.L.G.), the Sections of Critical Care and Pulmonary Medicine, Virginia Mason Medical Center (A.G.), and the Divisions of Pulmonary and Critical Care (C.R.D., S.O.) and Infectious Disease (J.D.G.), Swedish Medical Center \u2014 all in Seattle.\nAddress reprint requests to Dr. Bhatraju at University of Washington\u2013Harborview Medical Center, 325 9th Ave., Seattle, WA 98104, or at Bhatraju@uw.edu.\nSupplementary Material\nSupplementary Appendix PDF 234KB\nDisclosure Forms PDF 418KB\nData Sharing Statement PDF 77KB\nReferences (23)\nCiting Articles (43)", "10.1056/NEJMoa2008457": "22 References\n1 Citing Article\nAbstract\nBACKGROUND\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection can spread rapidly within skilled nursing facilities. After identification of a case of Covid-19 in a skilled nursing facility, we assessed transmission and evaluated the adequacy of symptom-based screening to identify infections in residents.\nMETHODS\nWe conducted two serial point-prevalence surveys, 1 week apart, in which assenting residents of the facility underwent nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal testing for SARS-CoV-2, including real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR), viral culture, and sequencing. Symptoms that had been present during the preceding 14 days were recorded. Asymptomatic residents who tested positive were reassessed 7 days later. Residents with SARS-CoV-2 infection were categorized as symptomatic with typical symptoms (fever, cough, or shortness of breath), symptomatic with only atypical symptoms, presymptomatic, or asymptomatic.\nRESULTS\nTwenty-three days after the first positive test result in a resident at this skilled nursing facility, 57 of 89 residents (64%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Among 76 residents who participated in point-prevalence surveys, 48 (63%) tested positive. Of these 48 residents, 27 (56%) were asymptomatic at the time of testing; 24 subsequently developed symptoms (median time to onset, 4 days). Samples from these 24 presymptomatic residents had a median rRT-PCR cycle threshold value of 23.1, and viable virus was recovered from 17 residents. As of April 3, of the 57 residents with SARS-CoV-2 infection, 11 had been hospitalized (3 in the intensive care unit) and 15 had died (mortality, 26%). Of the 34 residents whose specimens were sequenced, 27 (79%) had sequences that fit into two clusters with a difference of one nucleotide.\nCONCLUSIONS\nRapid and widespread transmission of SARS-CoV-2 was demonstrated in this skilled nursing facility. More than half of residents with positive test results were asymptomatic at the time of testing and most likely contributed to transmission. Infection-control strategies focused solely on symptomatic residents were not sufficient to prevent transmission after SARS-CoV-2 introduction into this facility.\nThe first reported case of coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) in the United States was diagnosed in a resident of Snohomish County, Washington, on January 20, 2020.1 In late February, an outbreak was identified in a skilled nursing facility in neighboring King County; morbidity and mortality among residents were high, straining the regional health care system.2,3\nWe report another outbreak of Covid-19 in a separate skilled nursing facility in the same county. In the course of this outbreak investigation, Public Health\u2013Seattle and King County (PHSKC) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) identified residents with asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection, which prompted further investigation. We performed serial point-prevalence surveys to assess the extent of transmission and to evaluate the adequacy of symptom-based screening of residents to identify infections. Initial findings of this investigation were previously reported.4\nDescription of the Outbreak\nOn February 29, 2020, in response to increased local awareness of Covid-19 in King County, Washington, administrative leadership at Facility A instituted enhanced infection-control measures. Nursing staff assessed residents twice daily for possible signs and symptoms of Covid-19, including fever (oral or temporal temperature measurement), cough, shortness of breath, and other symptoms. Health care personnel were assessed at the start of each shift with oral temperature measurement and screening for symptoms, including cough, shortness of breath, sore throat, or any other respiratory symptoms.\nOn March 1, one member of the health care staff tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 after having worked in a single unit (Unit 1) while symptomatic on February 26, the first day of symptoms, and on February 28. On March 5, the facility was informed that a hospitalized resident of Unit 1 (in whom symptoms had developed on March 2 and testing was done on March 3) had been diagnosed with Covid-19. Subsequently, all visitors were restricted and communal activities were canceled. PHSKC and the CDC initiated an outbreak investigation, and on March 6, provided on-site infection prevention and control recommendations, including the recommendation that all health care staff entering symptomatic residents\u2019 rooms wear eye protection, a gown, gloves, and a face mask (N95 respirators were not routinely available).5 On March 8, the CDC and PHSKC offered testing to all residents in Unit 1; 13 of 15 residents present were tested for SARS-CoV-2 (2 residents declined). A total of 6 residents tested positive; of these, 4 had symptoms (e.g., fever, cough, shortness of breath, or sore throat) and 2 had been asymptomatic during the preceding 14 days. On March 9, the facility implemented Covid-19 transmission-based precautions for all residents of Unit 1, regardless of symptoms or infection status.\nMethods\nSTUDY POPULATION\nFacility A is a 116-bed skilled nursing facility divided into four separate units with an equal mix of short- and long-term residents in each unit. There were 89 residents present at Facility A on March 3, the date of the first positive test in a resident. Facility A provided a list of full-time health care personnel by occupation. Results of positive SARS-CoV-2 tests obtained during postmortem examination or by outside health care providers during clinical evaluation of symptomatic residents and staff were provided to the CDC and PHSKC through March 26. All symptomatic health care personnel were advised to be tested by their health care provider; asymptomatic staff members were not tested as part of this investigation.\nPOINT-PREVALENCE SURVEYS\nOn two occasions, residents in the facility were offered SARS-CoV-2 testing as part of a facility-wide point-prevalence survey. The first survey was performed for all assenting residents, including those who had previously tested positive, on March 13 (10 days after the first resident had tested positive for SARS-CoV-2). Nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs were collected in accordance with CDC guidelines.6 A second survey was conducted 7 days later (March 19\u201320) for residents who had had either a negative test result or a positive result with atypical or no symptoms reported in the first survey.\nSYMPTOM ASSESSMENT\nOn the day of point-prevalence surveys, a standardized symptom-assessment form was completed by nurses for each resident tested. Symptoms present during the preceding 14 days were recorded on the basis of interview and review of medical records. Asymptomatic residents with a positive test result were reassessed for symptoms 7 days later. For additional details on symptom assessment, see the Supplementary Appendix, available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org.\nResidents were classified as symptomatic if they had had at least one new or worsened typical or atypical symptom of Covid-19 in the preceding 14 days. Residents with subjective fever or temperature greater than 100.0\u00b0F (37.8\u00b0C), cough, or shortness of breath were classified as symptomatic with typical symptoms.7 Residents were classified as symptomatic with atypical symptoms if their symptoms included only chills, malaise, increased confusion, rhinorrhea, nasal congestion, sore throat, myalgia, dizziness, headache, nausea, or diarrhea.\nAsymptomatic residents were those who had no symptoms or only stable chronic symptoms (e.g., chronic cough without worsening). Presymptomatic residents were those who were asymptomatic at the time of testing but developed symptoms within 7 days after testing. Residents who did not develop symptoms in the 7 days after testing remained classified as asymptomatic.\nLABORATORY TESTING\nThe Washington State Public Health Laboratory performed one-step real-time reverse transcriptase\u2013polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) on all samples, using the SARS-CoV-2 CDC assay protocol; cycle threshold (Ct) values were reported for two genetic markers: the N1 and N2 viral nucleocapsid protein gene regions.8,9 Values below 40 cycles indicate a positive result for SARS-CoV-2.\nAll rRT-PCR\u2013positive specimens from point-prevalence surveys were shipped to the CDC for viral culture using Vero-CCL-81 cells. Cells showing cytopathic effect were used for SARS-CoV-2 rRT-PCR to confirm isolation and viral growth in culture. Nucleic acid was extracted from rRT-PCR\u2013positive specimens and amplified for subsequent sequencing (Oxford Nanopore MinION), with phylogenetic trees inferred with the neighbor-joining method.10 Additional details on culture and sequencing methods are provided in the Supplementary Appendix.\nANALYSES\nThe daily proportions of residents with any known positive test for SARS-CoV-2 (including those tested as part of clinical management) were described according to their unit in the facility. The daily growth rate for the facility was estimated through regression analysis, using the log-transformed daily cumulative counts of all residents who were positive for SARS-CoV-2 from March 3 through March 20; doubling time was estimated by dividing the natural logarithm of 2 by the growth rate. Similarly, doubling time was estimated for all residents of King County, using case count data reported through the PHSKC Covid-19 data dashboard.11\nAll analyses were completed with SAS software, version 9.4 (SAS Institute). Data were collected as part of public health response and were deemed non\u2013human subjects research by the CDC.\nResults\nRESIDENTS\nFigure 1.\nResidents in Facility A on March 3 through Two Point-Prevalence Surveys.\nTable 1.\nDemographic Characteristics and Reported Symptoms in Residents of Facility A at the Time of Testing.\nOf the 89 residents who lived in Facility A when the first resident with confirmed Covid-19 was tested, 57 (64%) had tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 either during the point-prevalence surveys, clinical evaluation, or postmortem examination as of March 26. Seventy-six residents participated in the first point-prevalence survey on March 13 (Figure 1). Of these 76 residents, 48 (63%) tested positive in either the initial or subsequent point-prevalence surveys. Demographic characteristics, coexisting conditions, and symptoms of surveyed residents were similar, regardless of test result (Table 1).\nOf the 48 residents who tested positive from the surveys, 17 (35%) reported typical symptoms, 4 (8%) reported only atypical symptoms, and 27 (56%) reported no new symptoms or changes in chronic symptoms at the time of testing (Table 1 and Table S1). Among the 27 residents classified as asymptomatic, 15 reported no symptoms and 12 reported only stable chronic symptoms. Fifteen (56%) residents who were asymptomatic at the time of testing had documented cognitive impairment; similar proportions were reported in symptomatic residents (Table S2).\nIn the 7 days after their positive test, 24 of the 27 asymptomatic residents (89%) had onset of symptoms and were recategorized as presymptomatic. The median time to symptom onset was 4 days (interquartile range, 3 to 5). The most common new symptoms were fever (71%), cough (54%), and malaise (42%) (Table S3).\nCYCLE THRESHOLD AND VIRAL CULTURE\nFigure 2.\nCycle Threshold Values and Results of Viral Culture for Residents with Positive SARS-CoV-2 Tests According to Their Symptom Status.\nrRT-PCR Ct values for the N1 genetic markers for 47 residents ranged from 13.7 to 37.9; median Ct values for the four symptom status groups were similar (asymptomatic residents, 25.5; presymptomatic residents, 23.1; residents with atypical symptoms, 24.2; and residents with typical symptoms, 24.8) (Figure 2). SARS-CoV-2 growth was identified from 31 of 46 rRT-PCR\u2013positive specimens (Figure 2). Viral growth was observed for specimens obtained from 10 of 16 residents with typical symptoms, 3 of 4 with atypical symptoms, 17 of 24 who were presymptomatic, and 1 of 3 who remained asymptomatic.\nFigure 3.\nCycle Threshold Values Relative to First Evidence of Fever, Cough, or Shortness of Breath.\nWe observed no correlation between Ct values and the number of days from the first evidence of typical symptoms. Ct values consistent with a high viral load were identified among residents who tested positive before typical symptom onset (median Ct value among 26 observations, 24.0; interquartile range, 20.4 to 28.5) and those who tested positive 7 or more days after typical symptom onset (median Ct value among 8 observations, 25.0; interquartile range, 21.3 to 28.2) (Figure 3, and Fig. S1). Viable virus was isolated from specimens collected 6 days before to 9 days after the first evidence of typical symptoms.\nPREVALENCE AND TRANSMISSION IN THE FACILITY\nFigure 4.\nTimeline Showing Prevalence, Notable Events, and Implementation of Infection Prevention and Control Measures at Facility A.\nWe estimated the doubling time among residents to be 3.4 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 2.5 to 5.3) (Table S4). The doubling time for the surrounding King County was 5.5 days (95% CI, 4.8 to 6.7). As of April 3, a total of 11 of the 57 residents with SARS-CoV-2 infection identified by March 26 had been admitted to the hospital (including 3 in intensive care) and 15 had died (mortality, 26%). The unit where presumed introduction of infection took place and where the first resident with SARS-CoV-2 infection lived (Unit 1) had the highest prevalence in the facility at the end of the first point-prevalence survey. Although other units identified SARS-CoV-2 infection in residents later, their prevalence also continued to increase (Figure 4, and Fig. S4).\nBy the time of the first point-prevalence survey, 11 of 138 full-time staff members (8%) had had a positive test for SARS-CoV-2. By March 26, a total of 55 of the 138 (40%) had reported symptoms, 51 (37%) had been tested, and 26 (19%) had received a positive test result. Of the 26 staff members with positive tests, 17 were nursing staff and 9 had occupations that provided services across multiple units during their shift (therapists, environmental services, dietary services). No staff members with Covid-19 were hospitalized.\nThirty-nine specimens from 34 residents were sequenced. All sequences were identical or highly similar to sequences reported in previous analyses of Covid-19 cases in Washington (Fig. S3). Of the 34 residents whose specimens were sequenced, 27 (79%) had sequences that fit into two clusters with one nucleotide difference (Fig. S4 and Table S5).\nDiscussion\nTwenty-three days after identifying the first resident with SARS-CoV-2 infection, Facility A had a 64% prevalence of Covid-19 among residents, with a case fatality rate of 26% despite early adoption of infection-control measures. In addition, Covid-19 was diagnosed in 26 members of the staff (19%). These findings are strikingly similar to descriptions of the first Covid-19 outbreak in a U.S. skilled nursing facility, which occurred in the same county at nearly the same time.2 In the investigation reported here, more than half of the residents with positive tests were asymptomatic at the time of testing. Transmission from asymptomatic residents infected with SARS-CoV-2 most likely contributed to the rapid and extensive spread of infection to other residents and staff. Symptom-based infection-control strategies were not sufficient to prevent transmission after the introduction of SARS-CoV-2 into this skilled nursing facility.\nAlthough we are unable to quantify the contributions of asymptomatic and presymptomatic residents to transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in this facility, evidence suggests that these residents had the potential for substantial viral shedding. Ct values indicating large quantities of viral RNA were identified, and viable SARS-CoV-2 was isolated from specimens of asymptomatic and presymptomatic residents. Evidence of transmission from presymptomatic persons has been shown in epidemiologic investigations of SARS-CoV-2.12-14\nWe estimated that the doubling time in this facility was 3.4 days, which is faster than that of the surrounding community, 5.5 days. The accelerated doubling time was likely to have been due to inadequately controlled intrafacility transmission, which sequencing and spatiotemporal data suggest was the primary driver of new infections. Shedding of high viral titers from the respiratory tract, including shedding before the onset of symptoms, might have led to droplet and possibly aerosol transmission. Residents and staff members with undetected SARS-CoV-2 infection are likely to have contributed to transmission through interactions between and among residents and staff. The contribution of indirect contact transmission in this outbreak is not known. However, contaminated environmental surfaces and shared medical devices could also have played a role. Most of the early transmission appeared to have occurred in Unit 1, where the initial introduction of SARS-CoV-2 took place, several days before other units were involved. Early recognition of initial SARS-CoV-2 introduction combined with early interventions in all units might prevent spread within a facility.\nThe CDC and PHSKC confirmed Covid-19 infection in 26 symptomatic staff members associated with this skilled nursing facility as of March 26; these staff members most likely contributed to intrafacility transmission. A concurrent study of King County health care personnel with Covid-19 showed that 65% worked while symptomatic and that 17% of symptomatic health care personnel initially had mild, nonspecific symptoms and no fever, cough, shortness of breath, or sore throat.15 The potential for viral shedding from staff members with SARS-CoV-2 infection during either the presymptomatic or the mildly symptomatic phase of the illness reinforces current recommendations for expanded symptom screening for health care personnel and universal use of face masks for all health care staff in long-term care facilities.5\nCurrent interventions for preventing SARS-CoV-2 transmission in health care settings rely primarily on the presence of signs and symptoms to identify and isolate residents and staff who might have Covid-19. The data presented here suggest that sole reliance on symptom-based strategies may not be effective to prevent introduction of SARS-CoV-2 and further transmission in skilled nursing facilities. Impaired immune responses associated with aging and the high prevalence of underlying conditions, such as cognitive impairment and chronic cough, make it difficult to recognize early signs and symptoms of respiratory viral infections in this population.16 Studies have shown that in the elderly, including those living in skilled nursing facilities, influenza often manifests with few or atypical symptoms, delaying diagnosis and contributing to transmission.17,18 Furthermore, symptom-based cohorting strategies could inadvertently increase the risk of SARS-CoV-2 exposure for uninfected residents, given that typical symptoms were common in those who tested negative.\nOur investigation demonstrated a poor correlation between symptom onset and viral shedding that was potentially due to the difficulty of ascertaining precise dates of symptom onset or to differences in viral shedding in this population. Studies in other populations show that SARS-CoV-2 shedding is highest early in the illness.19,20 Our investigation shows that some facility residents shed virus for more than 7 days after symptom onset, a finding seen in some other populations.21 These data support current recommendations preferring a test-based strategy to discontinue transmission-based precautions for residents of skilled nursing facilities.22 If a non\u2013test-based strategy is used, these data support extending the duration of transmission-based precautions.22\nBecause asymptomatic or presymptomatic residents might play an important role in transmission in this high-risk population, additional prevention measures merit consideration, including using testing to guide the use of transmission-based precautions, isolation, and cohorting strategies. The ability to test large numbers of residents and staff with rapid turn-around times may expedite cohorting of residents and staff in locations designated for the care of those with SARS-CoV-2 infection either in different locations within individual facilities or in separate facilities.\nThis investigation has several limitations. First, challenges in symptom ascertainment may have resulted in misclassification of symptom grouping for some residents. However, multiple sources of symptom data were used to minimize such misclassification. The accuracy of symptom ascertainment for this investigation is likely to be equivalent to, if not exceed, symptom screening in most skilled nursing facilities, and thus, these findings should be generalizable to this setting. Second, because this analysis was conducted among residents of a skilled nursing facility, it is not known whether the findings apply to the general population, including younger persons, those without underlying medical conditions, or similarly aged populations in the general community or in other long-term care settings. Third, asymptomatic staff members were not tested; therefore, we are unable to document their role in transmission in this facility.\nSARS-CoV-2 can spread rapidly after introduction into skilled nursing facilities, resulting in substantial morbidity and mortality and increasing the burden on regional health care systems. Unrecognized asymptomatic and presymptomatic infections most likely contribute to transmission in these settings. During the current Covid-19 pandemic, skilled nursing facilities and all long-term care facilities should take proactive steps to prevent introduction of SARS-CoV-2. These steps include restricting visitors and nonessential personnel from entering the building, requiring universal use of face masks by all staff for source control while in the facility, and implementing strict screening of staff. Our data suggest that symptom-based strategies for identifying residents with SARS-CoV-2 are insufficient for preventing transmission in skilled nursing facilities. Once SARS-CoV-2 has been introduced, additional strategies should be implemented to prevent further transmission, including use of recommended personal protective equipment, when available, during all resident care activities regardless of symptoms.5 Consideration should be given to test-based strategies for identifying residents and staff with SARS-CoV-2 infection for the purpose of excluding infected staff and cohorting residents, either in designated units within a facility or in a separate facility designated for residents with Covid-19.\nDisclosure forms provided by the authors are available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org.\nMs. Arons and Ms. Hatfield contributed equally to this article.\nThe findings and conclusion in this report are those of the authors and do not necessarily represent the official position of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\nThis article was published on April 24, 2020, at NEJM.org.\nWe thank the facility residents; the staff of Facility A for their ongoing efforts to provide care in the face of these challenges; staff at the local and state health departments responding to this public health emergency; staff at the Washington State Department of Health Public Health Laboratories; CDC staff at the Emergency Operations Center; and members of the Covid-19 response teams at the local, state, and national levels for their unwavering commitment in the face of this global public health emergency.\nAuthor Affiliations\nFrom the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention COVID-19 Emergency Response (M.M.A., K.M.H., S.C.R., A.K., A.J., J.R.J., J.T., K.S., A.C.B., L.P.O., S.

Patients were those with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection who had an oxygen saturation of 94% or less while they were breathing ambient air or who were receiving oxygen support. Patients received a 10-day course of remdesivir, consisting of 200 mg administered intravenously on day 1, followed by 100 mg daily for the remaining 9 days of treatment. This report is based on data from patients who received remdesivir during the period from January 25, 2020, through March 7, 2020, and have clinical data for at least 1 subsequent day.\nRESULTS\nOf the 61 patients who received at least one dose of remdesivir, data from 8 could not be analyzed (including 7 patients with no post-treatment data and 1 with a dosing error). Of the 53 patients whose data were analyzed, 22 were in the United States, 22 in Europe or Canada, and 9 in Japan. At baseline, 30 patients (57%) were receiving mechanical ventilation and 4 (8%) were receiving extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. During a median follow-up of 18 days, 36 patients (68%) had an improvement in oxygen-support class, including 17 of 30 patients (57%) receiving mechanical ventilation who were extubated. A total of 25 patients (47%) were discharged, and 7 patients (13%) died; mortality was 18% (6 of 34) among patients receiving invasive ventilation and 5% (1 of 19) among those not receiving invasive ventilation.\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn this cohort of patients hospitalized for severe Covid-19 who were treated with compassionate-use remdesivir, clinical improvement was observed in 36 of 53 patients (68%). Measurement of efficacy will require ongoing randomized, placebo-controlled trials of remdesivir therapy. (Funded by Gilead Sciences.)\nSince the first cases were reported in December 2019, infection with the severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has become a worldwide pandemic.1,2 Covid-19 \u2014 the illness caused by SARS-CoV-2 \u2014 is overwhelming health care systems globally.3,4 The symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 infection vary widely, from asymptomatic disease to pneumonia and life-threatening complications, including acute respiratory distress syndrome, multisystem organ failure, and ultimately, death.5-7 Older patients and those with preexisting respiratory or cardiovascular conditions appear to be at the greatest risk for severe complications.6,7 In the absence of a proven effective therapy, current management consists of supportive care, including invasive and noninvasive oxygen support and treatment with antibiotics.8,9 In addition, many patients have received off-label or compassionate-use therapies, including antiretrovirals, antiparasitic agents, antiinflammatory compounds, and convalescent plasma.10-13\nRemdesivir is a prodrug of a nucleotide analogue that is intracellularly metabolized to an analogue of adenosine triphosphate that inhibits viral RNA polymerases. Remdesivir has broad-spectrum activity against members of several virus families, including filoviruses (e.g., Ebola) and coronaviruses (e.g., SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus [MERS-CoV]) and has shown prophylactic and therapeutic efficacy in nonclinical models of these coronaviruses.14-17 In vitro testing has also shown that remdesivir has activity against SARS-CoV-2. Remdesivir appears to have a favorable clinical safety profile, as reported on the basis of experience in approximately 500 persons, including healthy volunteers and patients treated for acute Ebola virus infection,18,19 and supported by our data (on file and shared with the World Health Organization [WHO]). In this report, we describe outcomes in a cohort of patients hospitalized for severe Covid-19 who were treated with remdesivir on a compassionate-use basis.\nMethods\nPATIENTS\nGilead Sciences began accepting requests from clinicians for compassionate use of remdesivir on January 25, 2020. To submit a request, clinicians completed an assessment form with demographic and disease-status information about their patient (see the Supplementary Appendix, available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org). Approval of requests was reserved for hospitalized patients who had SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed by reverse-transcriptase\u2013polymerase-chain-reaction assay and either an oxygen saturation of 94% or less while the patient was breathing ambient air or a need for oxygen support. In addition, patients were required to have a creatinine clearance above 30 ml per minute and serum levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) less than five times the upper limit of the normal range, and they had to agree not to use other investigational agents for Covid-19.\nIn approved cases, the planned treatment was a 10-day course of remdesivir, consisting of a loading dose of 200 mg intravenously on day 1, plus 100 mg daily for the following 9 days. Supportive therapy was to be provided at the discretion of the clinicians. Follow-up was to continue through at least 28 days after the beginning of treatment with remdesivir or until discharge or death. Data that were collected through March 30, 2020, are reported here. This open-label program did not have a predetermined number of patients, number of sites, or duration. Data for some patients included in this analysis have been reported previously.20-22 Details of the study design and conduct can be seen in the protocol (available at NEJM.org).\nSTUDY ASSESSMENTS\nData on patients\u2019 oxygen-support requirements, adverse events, and laboratory values, including serum creatinine, ALT, and AST, were to be reported daily, from day 1 through day 10, and additional follow-up information was solicited through day 28. Although there were no prespecified end points for this program, we quantified the incidence of key clinical events, including changes in oxygen-support requirements (ambient air, low-flow oxygen, nasal high-flow oxygen, noninvasive positive pressure ventilation [NIPPV], invasive mechanical ventilation, and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation [ECMO]), hospital discharge, and reported adverse events, including those leading to discontinuation of treatment, serious adverse events, and death. In addition, we evaluated the proportion of patients with clinical improvement, as defined by live discharge from the hospital, a decrease of at least 2 points from baseline on a modified ordinal scale (as recommended by the WHO R&D Blueprint Group), or both. The six-point scale consists of the following categories: 1, not hospitalized; 2, hospitalized, not requiring supplemental oxygen; 3, hospitalized, requiring supplemental oxygen; 4, hospitalized, requiring nasal high-flow oxygen therapy, noninvasive mechanical ventilation, or both; 5, hospitalized, requiring invasive mechanical ventilation, ECMO, or both; and 6, death.\nPROGRAM OVERSIGHT\nRegulatory and institutional review board or independent ethics committee approval was obtained for each patient treated with remdesivir, and consent was obtained for all patients in accordance with local regulations. The program was designed and conducted by the sponsor (Gilead Sciences), in accordance with the protocol. The sponsor collected the data, monitored conduct of the program, and performed the statistical analyses. All authors had access to the data and assume responsibility for the integrity and completeness of the reported data. The initial draft of the manuscript was prepared by a writer employed by Gilead Sciences along with one of the authors, with input from all the authors.\nSTATISTICAL ANALYSIS\nNo sample-size calculations were performed. The analysis population included all patients who received their first dose of remdesivir on or before March 7, 2020, and for whom clinical data for at least 1 subsequent day were available. Clinical improvement and mortality in the remdesivir compassionate-use cohort were described with the use of Kaplan\u2013Meier analysis. Associations between pretreatment characteristics and these outcomes were evaluated with Cox proportional hazards regression. Because the analysis did not include a provision for correcting for multiple comparisons in tests for association between baseline variables and outcomes, results are reported as point estimates and 95% confidence intervals. The widths of the confidence intervals have not been adjusted for multiple comparisons, so the intervals should not be used to infer definitive associations with outcomes. All analyses were conducted with SAS software, version 9.4 (SAS Institute).\nResults\nPATIENTS\nIn total, 61 patients received at least one dose of remdesivir on or before March 7, 2020; 8 of these patients were excluded because of missing postbaseline information (7 patients) and an erroneous remdesivir start date (1 patient) (Fig. S1 in the Supplementary Appendix). Of the 53 remaining patients included in this analysis, 40 (75%) received the full 10-day course of remdesivir, 10 (19%) received 5 to 9 days of treatment, and 3 (6%) fewer than 5 days of treatment.\nBASELINE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE PATIENTS\nTable 1.\nBaseline Demographic and Clinical Characteristics of the Patients.\nTable 1 shows baseline demographic and clinical characteristics of the 53 patients in the compassionate-use cohort. Patients were enrolled in the United States (22 patients), Japan (9), Italy (12), Austria (1), France (4), Germany (2), Netherlands (1), Spain (1), and Canada (1). A total of 40 patients (75%) were men, the age range was 23 to 82 years, and the median age was 64 years (interquartile range, 48 to 71). At baseline, the majority of patients (34 [64%]) were receiving invasive ventilation, including 30 (57%) receiving mechanical ventilation and 4 (8%) receiving ECMO. The median duration of invasive mechanical ventilation before the initiation of remdesivir treatment was 2 days (interquartile range, 1 to 8). As compared with patients who were receiving noninvasive oxygen support at baseline, those receiving invasive ventilation tended to be older (median age, 67 years, vs. 53 years), were more likely to be male (79%, vs. 68%), had higher median serum ALT (48 U per liter, vs. 27) and creatinine (0.90 mg per deciliter, vs. 0.79 [79.6 \u03bcmol per liter, vs. 69.8]), and a higher prevalence of coexisting conditions, including hypertension (26%, vs. 21%), diabetes (24%, vs. 5%), hyperlipidemia (18%, vs. 0%), and asthma (15%, vs. 5%). The median duration of symptoms before the initiation of remdesivir treatment was 12 days (interquartile range, 9 to 15) and did not differ substantially between patients receiving invasive ventilation and those receiving noninvasive ventilation (Table 1).\nCLINICAL IMPROVEMENT DURING REMDESIVIR TREATMENT\nFigure 1.\nOxygen-Support Status at Baseline and after Treatment.\nFigure 2.\nChanges in Oxygen-Support Status from Baseline in Individual Patients.\nOver a median follow-up of 18 days (interquartile range, 13 to 23) after receiving the first dose of remdesivir, 36 of 53 patients (68%) showed an improvement in the category of oxygen support, whereas 8 of 53 patients (15%) showed worsening (Figure 1). Improvement was observed in all 12 patients who were breathing ambient air or receiving low-flow supplemental oxygen and in 5 of 7 patients (71%) who were receiving noninvasive oxygen support (NIPPV or high-flow supplemental oxygen). It is notable that 17 of 30 patients (57%) who were receiving invasive mechanical ventilation were extubated, and 3 of 4 patients (75%) receiving ECMO stopped receiving it; all were alive at last follow-up. Individual patients\u2019 changes in the category of oxygen support are shown in Figure 2. By the date of the most recent follow-up, 25 of 53 patients (47%) had been discharged (24% receiving invasive ventilation [8 of 34 patients] and 89% [17 of 19 patients] receiving noninvasive oxygen support).\nFigure 3.\nCumulative Incidence of Clinical Improvement from Baseline to Day 36.\nBy 28 days of follow-up, the cumulative incidence of clinical improvement, as defined by either a decrease of 2 points or more on the six-point ordinal scale or live discharge, was 84% (95% confidence interval [CI], 70 to 99) by Kaplan\u2013Meier analysis (Figure 3A). Clinical improvement was less frequent among patients receiving invasive ventilation than among those receiving noninvasive ventilation (hazard ratio for improvement, 0.33; 95% CI, 0.16 to 0.68) (Figure 3B) and among patients 70 years of age or older (hazard ratio as compared with patients younger than 50 years, 0.29; 95% CI, 0.11 to 0.74) (Figure 3C). Sex, region of enrollment, coexisting conditions, and duration of symptoms before remdesivir treatment was initiated were not significantly associated with clinical improvement (Table S1).\nMORTALITY\nSeven of the 53 patients (13%) died after the completion of remdesivir treatment, including 6 of 34 patients (18%) who were receiving invasive ventilation and 1 of 19 (5%) who were receiving noninvasive oxygen support (see the Supplementary Appendix for case narratives). The median interval between remdesivir initiation and death was 15 days (interquartile range, 9 to 17). Overall mortality from the date of admission was 0.56 per 100 hospitalization days (95% CI, 0.14 to 0.97) and did not differ substantially among patients receiving invasive ventilation (0.57 per 100 hospitalization days; 95% CI, 0 to 1.2]) as compared with those receiving noninvasive ventilation (0.51 per 100 hospitalization days; 95% CI, 0.07 to 1.1]). Risk of death was greater among patients who were 70 years of age or older (hazard ratio as compared with patients younger than 70 years, 11.34; 95% CI, 1.36 to 94.17) and among those with higher serum creatinine at baseline (hazard ratio per milligram per deciliter, 1.91; 95% CI, 1.22 to 2.99). The hazard ratio for patients receiving invasive ventilation as compared with those receiving noninvasive oxygen support was 2.78 (95% CI, 0.33 to 23.19) (Table S2).\nSAFETY\nTable 2.\nSummary of Adverse Events.\nA total of 32 patients (60%) reported adverse events during follow-up (Table 2). The most common adverse events were increased hepatic enzymes, diarrhea, rash, renal impairment, and hypotension. In general, adverse events were more common in patients receiving invasive ventilation. A total of 12 patients (23%) had serious adverse events. The most common serious adverse events \u2014 multiple-organ-dysfunction syndrome, septic shock, acute kidney injury, and hypotension \u2014 were reported in patients who were receiving invasive ventilation at baseline.\nFour patients (8%) discontinued remdesivir treatment prematurely: one because of worsening of preexisting renal failure, one because of multiple organ failure, and two because of elevated aminotransferases, including one patient with a maculopapular rash.\nLABORATORY DATA\nGiven the nature of this compassionate-use program, data on a limited number of laboratory measures were collected. Median serum ALT, AST, and creatinine fluctuated during follow-up (Fig. S2).\nDiscussion\nTo date, no therapy has demonstrated efficacy for patients with Covid-19. This preliminary report describes the clinical outcomes in a small cohort of patients who were severely ill with Covid-19 and were treated with remdesivir. Although data from several ongoing randomized, controlled trials will soon provide more informative evidence regarding the safety and efficacy of remdesivir for Covid-19, the outcomes observed in this compassionate-use program are the best currently available data. Specifically, improvement in oxygen-support status was observed in 68% of patients, and overall mortality was 13% over a median follow-up of 18 days. In a recent randomized, controlled trial of lopinavir\u2013ritonavir in patients hospitalized for Covid-19, the 28-day mortality was 22%.10 It is important to note that only 1 of 199 patients in that trial were receiving invasive ventilation at baseline. In case series and cohort studies, largely from China, mortality rates of 17 to 78% have been reported in severe cases, defined by the need for admission to an intensive care unit, invasive ventilation, or both.23-28 For example, among 201 patients hospitalized in Wuhan, China, mortality was 22% overall and 66% (44 of 67) among patients receiving invasive mechanical ventilation.7 By way of comparison, the 13% mortality observed in this remdesivir compassionate-use cohort is noteworthy, considering the severity of disease in this patient population; however, the patients enrolled in this compassionate-treatment program are not directly comparable to those studied in these other reports. For example, 64% of remdesivir-treated patients were receiving invasive ventilation at baseline, including 8% who were receiving ECMO, and mortality in this subgroup was 18% (as compared with 5.3% in patients receiving noninvasive oxygen support), and the majority (75%) of patients were male, were over 60 years of age, and had coexisting conditions.\nUnfortunately, our compassionate-use program did not collect viral load data to confirm the antiviral effects of remdesivir or any association between baseline viral load and viral suppression, if any, and clinical response. Moreover, the duration of remdesivir therapy was not entirely uniform in our study, largely because clinical improvement enabled discharge from the hospital. The effectiveness of a shorter duration of therapy (e.g., 5 days, as compared with 10 days), which would allow the treatment of more patients during the pandemic, is being assessed in ongoing randomized trials of this therapy.\nNo new safety signals were detected during short-term remdesivir therapy in this compassionate-use cohort. Nonclinical toxicology studies have shown renal abnormalities, but no clear evidence of nephrotoxicity due to remdesivir therapy was observed. As reported in studies in healthy volunteers and patients infected with Ebola virus, mild-to-moderate elevations in ALT, AST, or both were observed in this cohort of patients with severe Covid-19.18,19 However, considering the frequency of liver dysfunction in patients with Covid-19, attribution of hepatotoxicity to either remdesivir or the underlying disease is challenging.29 Nevertheless, the safety and side-effect profile of remdesivir in patients with Covid-19 require proper assessment in placebo-controlled trials.\nInterpretation of the results of this study is limited by the small size of the cohort, the relatively short duration of follow-up, potential missing data owing to the nature of the program, the lack of information on 8 of the patients initially treated, and the lack of a randomized control group. Although the latter precludes definitive conclusions, comparisons with contemporaneous cohorts from the literature, in whom general care is expected to be consistent with that of our cohort, suggest that remdesivir may have clinical benefit in patients with severe Covid-19. Nevertheless, other factors may have contributed to differences in outcomes, including the type of supportive care (e.g., concomitant medications or variations in ventilatory practices) and differences in institutional treatment protocols and thresholds for hospitalization. Moreover, the use of invasive ventilation as a proxy for disease severity may be influenced by the availability of ventilators in a given location. The findings from these uncontrolled data will be informed by the ongoing randomized, placebo-controlled trials of remdesivir therapy for Covid-19.\nSupported by Gilead Sciences.\nDisclosure forms provided by the authors are available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org.\nThis article was published on April 10, 2020, at NEJM.org.\nWe thank Sarah Tse, Deborah Ajayi, and Gretchen Schmelz of BioScience Communications for creating earlier versions of the figures.

Concern has been aroused regarding a potential harmful effect of angiotensin-converting\u2013enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin-receptor blockers (ARBs) in this clinical context.\nMETHODS\nUsing an observational database from 169 hospitals in Asia, Europe, and North America, we evaluated the relationship of cardiovascular disease and drug therapy with in-hospital death among hospitalized patients with Covid-19 who were admitted between December 20, 2019, and March 15, 2020, and were recorded in the Surgical Outcomes Collaborative registry as having either died in the hospital or survived to discharge as of March 28, 2020.\nRESULTS\nOf the 8910 patients with Covid-19 for whom discharge status was available at the time of the analysis, a total of 515 died in the hospital (5.8%) and 8395 survived to discharge. The factors we found to be independently associated with an increased risk of in-hospital death were an age greater than 65 years (mortality of 10.0%, vs. 4.9% among those \u226465 years of age; odds ratio, 1.93; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.60 to 2.41), coronary artery disease (10.2%, vs. 5.2% among those without disease; odds ratio, 2.70; 95% CI, 2.08 to 3.51), heart failure (15.3%, vs. 5.6% among those without heart failure; odds ratio, 2.48; 95% CI, 1.62 to 3.79), cardiac arrhythmia (11.5%, vs. 5.6% among those without arrhythmia; odds ratio, 1.95; 95% CI, 1.33 to 2.86), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (14.2%, vs. 5.6% among those without disease; odds ratio, 2.96; 95% CI, 2.00 to 4.40), and current smoking (9.4%, vs. 5.6% among former smokers or nonsmokers; odds ratio, 1.79; 95% CI, 1.29 to 2.47). No increased risk of in-hospital death was found to be associated with the use of ACE inhibitors (2.1% vs. 6.1%; odds ratio, 0.33; 95% CI, 0.20 to 0.54) or the use of ARBs (6.8% vs. 5.7%; odds ratio, 1.23; 95% CI, 0.87 to 1.74).\nCONCLUSIONS\nOur study confirmed previous observations suggesting that underlying cardiovascular disease is associated with an increased risk of in-hospital death among patients hospitalized with Covid-19. Our results did not confirm previous concerns regarding a potential harmful association of ACE inhibitors or ARBs with in-hospital death in this clinical context. (Funded by the William Harvey Distinguished Chair in Advanced Cardiovascular Medicine at Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital.)\nAs the coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) pandemic has spread around the globe, there has been growing recognition that persons with underlying increased cardiovascular risk may be disproportionately affected.1-3 Several studies of case series have noted cardiac arrhythmias, cardiomyopathy, and cardiac arrest as terminal events in patients with Covid-19.1-4 Higher incidences of cardiac arrhythmias, acute coronary syndromes, and heart failure\u2013related events have also been reported during seasonal influenza outbreaks, which suggests that acute respiratory infections may result in activation of coagulation pathways, proinflammatory effects, and endothelial cell dysfunction.5 In addition, however, concern has been expressed that medical therapy for cardiovascular disease might specifically contribute to the severity of illness in patients with Covid-19.6,7\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of Covid-19, has been shown to establish itself in the host through the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as its cellular receptor.8 ACE2 is a membrane-bound aminopeptidase found ubiquitously in humans and expressed predominantly in heart, intestine, kidney, and pulmonary alveolar (type II) cells.7,9 Entry of SARS-CoV-2 into human cells is facilitated by the interaction of a receptor-binding domain in its viral spike glycoprotein ectodomain with the ACE2 receptor.10\nACE2 is counterregulatory to the activity of angiotensin II generated through ACE1 and is protective against detrimental activation of the renin\u2013angiotensin\u2013aldosterone system. Angiotensin II is catalyzed by ACE2 to angiotensin-(1\u20137), which exerts vasodilatory, antiinflammatory, antifibrotic, and antigrowth effects.11 It has been suggested that ACE inhibitors and angiotensin-receptor blockers (ARBs) may increase the expression of ACE2, which has been shown in the heart in rats,12 and thereby may confer a predisposition to more severe infection and adverse outcomes during Covid-19.6,7 Others have suggested that ACE inhibitors may counter the antiinflammatory effects of ACE2. However, in vitro studies have not shown direct inhibitory activity of ACE inhibitors against ACE2 function.9,13\nDespite these uncertainties, some have recommended cessation of treatment with ACE inhibitors and ARBs in patients with Covid-19.6 However, several scientific societies, including the American Heart Association, the American College of Cardiology, the Heart Failure Society of America, and the Council on Hypertension of the European Society of Cardiology, have urged that these important medications should not be discontinued in the absence of clear clinical evidence of harm.14,15 We therefore undertook a study to investigate the relationship between underlying cardiovascular disease and Covid-19 outcomes and to evaluate the association between cardiovascular drug therapy and mortality in this illness.\nMethods\nDATA SOURCE\nWe analyzed deidentified data from the Surgical Outcomes Collaborative (Surgisphere), an international registry. Our analysis included data from 169 hospitals located in 11 countries in Asia, Europe, and North America. The collaborative uses automated extraction of data from inpatient and outpatient electronic health records, supply-chain databases, and financial records, combined with point-of-care data entry for procedures. A manual data-entry process is used for quality assurance and validation. Data are collected through automated data transfers that capture information from each health care entity at regular intervals on a prospective, ongoing basis. Verifiable source documentation for the data elements includes electronic inpatient and outpatient medical records.\nData acquisition is facilitated through the use of a standardized Health Level Seven\u2013compliant data dictionary. After this data dictionary is harmonized with data from electronic health records, the majority of the data acquisition is completed with automated interfaces. The collected data sample from each health care entity is validated against financial records and external databases. All protected health information is stripped from each record before storage in a cloud-based data warehouse. The collaborative is compliant with the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality guidelines for registries and the Food and Drug Administration guidance on real-world evidence. The collection and analysis of data in the registry have been deemed exempt from ethics review.\nDATA COLLECTION\nThe collaborative registry was used as a resource to analyze data from all patients with polymerase-chain-reaction (PCR)\u2013proven Covid-19 who were admitted to the hospital between December 20, 2019, and March 15, 2020, and who were recorded in the registry as having either died in the hospital or survived to hospital discharge as of March 28, 2020. Data from the registry can be analyzed only after a patient\u2019s hospitalization is complete, and therefore our sample did not include patients who were admitted to the hospital during this time window but were still hospitalized at the end of it. Our sample also may have excluded some patients who had died or were discharged by March 28 but whose discharge status had not yet been recorded by the hospital.\nThe presence in the record of a positive laboratory finding confirming SARS-CoV-2 infection was used for classifying a patient as positive for Covid-19. A positive laboratory finding for SARS-CoV-2 was defined as a positive result on high-throughput sequencing or real-time reverse-transcriptase\u2013PCR (RT-PCR) assay of nasal or pharyngeal swab specimens. At each site, Covid-19 was diagnosed on the basis of the World Health Organization guidance.16 Patients who did not undergo testing, had no record of testing in the collaborative database, or had a negative test were not included in the present study. For this study, only one positive test was necessary for the patient to be included in the analysis.\nData on patients\u2019 demographic characteristics, coexisting conditions (based on codes from the International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, Clinical Modification), and cardiovascular drug therapy were included in this analysis. Clinical information included age, sex, continent of origin, and underlying coexisting conditions as noted in either the inpatient or the outpatient electronic health record. Coexisting conditions included chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), an immunosuppressed condition (glucocorticoid use, a preexisting immunologic condition, or ongoing chemotherapy in patients with cancer), current or remote history of smoking, and a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, or underlying cardiovascular disease (including coronary artery disease, heart failure, and cardiac arrhythmia). Cardiovascular drug therapy recorded at the time of hospital admission was also included, including any antiplatelet therapy, use of insulin or other hypoglycemic agents, beta-blockers, statins, ARBs, and ACE inhibitors.\nAll the authors reviewed the manuscript and vouch for the accuracy and completeness of the data provided.\nSTATISTICAL ANALYSIS\nThe primary analysis was an evaluation of the relationship of preexisting cardiovascular disease and drug therapy with the end point of in-hospital death while controlling for confounders, including demographic characteristics and coexisting conditions. Categorical variables are shown as frequencies and percentages, and continuous variables as means and standard deviations. Independent sample t-tests were completed, and point differences with 95% confidence intervals are reported for all comparisons between variables. Multiple imputation for missing values was not possible because for disease and drug variables there were no codes to indicate that data were missing; if the patient\u2019s electronic health record did not include information on a clinical characteristic, such as hyperlipidemia or the use of beta-blockers, it was assumed that that characteristic was not present.\nA multivariable logistic-regression analysis was performed to ascertain the effects of age, race, coexisting conditions (coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, cardiac arrhythmia, diabetes mellitus, COPD, current smoking, former smoking, hypertension, immunocompromised state, and hyperlipidemia), hospital location (according to country), and medications (ACE inhibitors, ARBs, beta-blockers, antiplatelet agents, statins, insulin, and oral hypoglycemic agents) on the likelihood of in-hospital death. Linearity of the continuous variables with respect to the logit of the dependent variable was confirmed. Odds ratios and corresponding 95% confidence intervals were calculated. Separate age- and sex-adjusted analyses were also performed. The 95% confidence intervals have not been adjusted for multiple testing and should not be used to infer definitive effects.\nOn the basis of the results of the initial analyses, additional analyses were performed to examine the robustness of the estimates initially obtained. Analyses according to continent of origin as well as country classification (as either high income or low\u2013middle income) were performed. A tipping-point analysis (an analysis that shows the effect size and prevalence of an unmeasured confounder that could shift the upper boundary of the confidence interval toward null) was performed. In addition, we sought to determine whether the effect of ACE inhibitors and statins noted in the overall study was also seen when the analysis was confined to a subgroup of patients who might have an indication for these agents. Thus, the association of ACE inhibitor use with in-hospital death was examined in the subgroup of patients with hypertension, and the association of statin use with in-hospital death was examined in the subgroup of patients with hyperlipidemia, with the use of age- and sex-adjusted logistic-regression analysis. All statistical analyses were performed with R software, version 3.6.3 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing), and SPSS Statistics software, version 26 (IBM).\nResults\nPATIENTS\nOur study population included 8910 hospitalized patients from 169 hospitals who had Covid-19, who were admitted between December 20, 2019, and March 15, 2020, and who completed their hospital course (discharged alive or died) by March 28, 2020. Patients who were hospitalized during this time without a completed course could not be included in the analysis. Our sample was made up of 1536 patients (17.2%) from North America, 5755 (64.6%) from Europe, and 1619 (18.2%) from Asia (details of the study population according to continent, country, and number of hospitals are provided in Table S1 in the Supplementary Appendix, available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org). The mean (\u00b1SD) age was 49\u00b116 years (16.5% of the patients were >65 years of age), 40.0% of the patients were women, 63.5% were white, 7.9% were black, 6.3% were Hispanic, and 19.3% were Asian.\nWith respect to cardiovascular risk factors, 30.5% of the patients had hyperlipidemia, 26.3% had hypertension, 14.3% had diabetes mellitus, 16.8% were former smokers, and 5.5% were current smokers. Preexisting cardiovascular disease in this sample included coronary artery disease (present in 11.3% of the patients), a history of congestive heart failure (2.1%), and a history of cardiac arrhythmia (3.4%). Other coexisting conditions included COPD (in 2.5% of the patients) and an underlying immunosuppressed condition (2.8%). Medical therapy included ACE inhibitors (8.6% of the patients), ARBs (6.2%), statins (9.7%), beta-blockers (5.9%), and antiplatelet agents (3.3%). Insulin was used in 3.4% of the patients, and other hypoglycemic agents were used in 9.6%. The mean length of hospital stay was 10.7\u00b12.7 days, with an overall in-hospital mortality of 5.8% (515 of 8910 patients) in this population of patients with completed outcomes. Of the patients who had been admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU) at any time during their hospitalization, 24.7% died, as compared with 4.0% of the patients who had not been admitted to an ICU.\nANALYSIS OF SURVIVORS AS COMPARED WITH NONSURVIVORS\nTable 1.\nDemographic Characteristics and Coexisting Conditions among Survivors and Nonsurvivors of Covid-19.\nTable 2.\nCardiovascular Drug Therapy at Hospitalization among Survivors and Nonsurvivors of Covid-19.\nTable 1 shows the distribution of demographic characteristics and coexisting conditions among survivors and nonsurvivors, along with the between-group differences and 95% confidence intervals. Nonsurvivors were older, more likely to be white, and more often men, and they had a greater prevalence of diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, coronary artery disease, heart failure, and cardiac arrhythmias. Patients who died were also more likely to have had COPD and a history of current smoking. Among medications, ACE inhibitors and statins were more commonly used by survivors than by nonsurvivors (Table 2), whereas no association between survival and the use of ARBs was found. The length of hospital stay differed between survivors and nonsurvivors (10.5\u00b12.5 days vs. 7.5\u00b12.8 days). When the data were analyzed according to age decile, continent, or income category of the country in which the hospital was located (high income or low\u2013middle income), the results were similar (Fig. S1 and Tables S2 and S3).\nMULTIVARIABLE LOGISTIC-REGRESSION ANALYSIS\nFigure 1.\nIndependent Predictors of In-Hospital Death from Multivariable Logistic-Regression Analysis.\nA multivariable logistic-regression model was developed. Independent predictors of in-hospital death and their corresponding odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals are shown in Figure 1. An age greater than 65 years, coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, cardiac arrhythmia, COPD, and current smoking were associated with a higher risk of in-hospital death. Female sex, the use of ACE inhibitors, and the use of statins were associated with a better chance of survival to hospital discharge, with no association found for the use of ARBs. For female sex, the odds ratio for dying in the hospital was 0.79 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.65 to 0.95); for ACE inhibitor use, the odds ratio was 0.33 (95% CI, 0.20 to 0.54); and for statin use, the odds ratio was 0.35 (95% CI, 0.24 to 0.52). For ARB use, the odds ratio was 1.23 (95% CI, 0.87 to 1.74). The presence or absence of an immunosuppressed condition, the race or ethnic group, and the presence or absence of hyperlipidemia or diabetes mellitus were not independent predictors of death in the hospital. The analyses according to continent and according to the income category of the country (high or low\u2013middle) were consistent with the overall results (Tables S4 and S5). Data from the age- and sex-adjusted multivariable logistic-regression analyses are shown in Table S6.\nADDITIONAL ANALYSES\nIn the tipping-point analysis to assess the potential effect of an unmeasured confounder, it was estimated that a hypothetical unobserved binary confounder with a prevalence of 10% in the study population would need to have an odds ratio of at least 10 in order for the observed associations for either ACE inhibitors or statins to have 95% confidence intervals crossing the odds ratio boundary of 1.0 (Table S7). We also separately examined the interaction of ACE inhibitor use with mortality in the subgroup with hypertension and the interaction of statin use with mortality in the subgroup with hyperlipidemia. These analyses, shown in Table S8, are consistent with the results of the primary analysis.\nDiscussion\nOur investigation confirms previous reports of the independent relationship of older age, underlying cardiovascular disease (coronary artery disease, heart failure, and cardiac arrhythmias), current smoking, and COPD with death in Covid-19. Our results also suggest that women are proportionately more likely than men to survive the infection. Neither harmful nor beneficial associations were noted for antiplatelet therapy, beta-blockers, or hypoglycemic therapy. It is important to note that we were not able to confirm previous concerns regarding a potential harmful association of either ACE inhibitors or ARBs with in-hospital mortality in this clinical context.\nIn viral infections such as influenza, older age is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular events and death.5 In the 2003 epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS, caused by SARS-CoV-1 infection), sex differences in the risk of death similar to those we observed were noted.17 Women have stronger innate and adaptive immunity and greater resistance to viral infections than men.18 In animal models of SARS-CoV-1 infection, higher susceptibility of male mice to SARS-CoV-1 and greater accumulation of macrophages and neutrophils in the lungs have been described.19 Ovariectomy or the use of estrogen-receptor antagonists increased mortality from SARS-CoV-1 infection in female animals. Furthermore, the difference in risk between the sexes increased with advancing age.19 These findings may support the observation in our investigation that suggested an association between survival and female sex, independent of older age.\nInfection with SARS-CoV-2 is a mild disease in most people, but in some the disease progresses to a severe respiratory illness characterized by a hyperinflammatory syndrome, multiorgan dysfunction, and death.20 In the lung, the viral spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 interacts with cell-surface ACE2, and the virus is internalized by endocytosis. The endocytic event up-regulates the activity of ADAM metallopeptidase domain 17 (ADAM17), which cleaves ACE2 from the cell membrane, resulting in a loss of ACE2-mediated protection against the effects of activation of the tissue renin\u2013angiotensin\u2013aldosterone system while mediating the release of proinflammatory cytokines into the circulation.21 The stress of critical illness and inflammation may unite in destabilizing preexisting cardiovascular illness. Vascular endothelial cell dysfunction, inflammation-associated myocardial depression, stress cardiomyopathy, direct viral infection of the heart and its vessels, or the host response may cause or worsen heart failure, demand-related ischemia, and arrhythmias.22 These factors may underlie the observed associations between cardiovascular disease and death in Covid-19.\nIn our analyses, use of either ACE inhibitors or statins was associated with better survival among patients with Covid-19. However, these associations should be considered with extreme caution. Because our study was not a randomized, controlled trial, we cannot exclude the possibility of confounding. In addition, we examined relationships between many variables and in-hospital death, and no primary hypothesis was prespecified; these factors increased the probability of chance associations being found. Therefore, a cause-and-effect relationship between drug therapy and survival should not be inferred. These data also offer no information concerning the potential effect of initiation of ACE inhibitor or statin therapy in patients with Covid-19 who do not have an appropriate indication for these medications. Randomized clinical trials evaluating the role of ACE inhibitors and statins will be necessary before any conclusion can be reached regarding a potential benefit of these agents in patients with Covid-19.\nIn this multinational observational study involving patients hospitalized with Covid-19, we confirmed previous observations suggesting that underlying cardiovascular disease is independently associated with an increased risk of in-hospital death. We were not able to confirm previous concerns regarding a potential harmful association of ACE inhibitors or ARBs with in-hospital mortality in this clinical context.\nSupported by the William Harvey Distinguished Chair in Advanced Cardiovascular Medicine at Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 1 (SARS-CoV-1) and SARS-CoV-2, which have been responsible for the SARS epidemic in 2002 to 2004 and for the more recent coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) pandemic, respectively, interface with the RAAS through angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), an enzyme that physiologically counters RAAS activation but also functions as a receptor for both SARS viruses.1,2 The interaction between the SARS viruses and ACE2 has been proposed as a potential factor in their infectivity,3,4 and there are concerns about the use of RAAS inhibitors that may alter ACE2 and whether variation in ACE2 expression may be in part responsible for disease virulence in the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic.5-8 Indeed, some media sources and health systems have recently called for the discontinuation of ACE inhibitors and angiotensin-receptor blockers (ARBs), both prophylactically and in the context of suspected Covid-19.\nGiven the common use of ACE inhibitors and ARBs worldwide, guidance on the use of these drugs in patients with Covid-19 is urgently needed. Here, we highlight that the data in humans are too limited to support or refute these hypotheses and concerns. Specifically, we discuss the uncertain effects of RAAS blockers on ACE2 levels and activity in humans, and we propose an alternative hypothesis that ACE2 may be beneficial rather than harmful in patients with lung injury. We also explicitly raise the concern that withdrawal of RAAS inhibitors may be harmful in certain high-risk patients with known or suspected Covid-19.\nCovid-19 and Older Adults with Coexisting Conditions\nInitial reports5-8 have called attention to the potential overrepresentation of hypertension among patients with Covid-19. In the largest of several case series from China that have been released during the Covid-19 pandemic (Table S1 in the Supplementary Appendix, available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org), hypertension was the most frequent coexisting condition in 1099 patients, with an estimated prevalence of 15%9; however, this estimate appears to be lower than the estimated prevalence of hypertension seen with other viral infections10 and in the general population in China.11,12\nCoexisting conditions, including hypertension, have consistently been reported to be more common among patients with Covid-19 who have had severe illness, been admitted to the intensive care unit, received mechanical ventilation, or died than among patients who have had mild illness. There are concerns that medical management of these coexisting conditions, including the use of RAAS inhibitors, may have contributed to the adverse health outcomes observed. However, these conditions appear to track closely with advancing age,13 which is emerging as the strongest predictor of Covid-19\u2013related death.14 Unfortunately, reports to date have not rigorously accounted for age or other key factors that contribute to health as potential confounders in risk prediction. With other infective illnesses, coexisting conditions such as hypertension have been key prognostic determinants,10 and this also appears to be the case with Covid-19.15\nIt is important to note that, despite inferences about the use of background RAAS inhibitors, specific details have been lacking in studies (Table S1). Population-based studies have estimated that only 30 to 40% of patients in China who have hypertension are treated with any antihypertensive therapy; RAAS inhibitors are used alone or in combination in 25 to 30% of these treated patients.11,12 Given such estimates, only a fraction of patients with Covid-19, at least in China, are anticipated to have been previously treated with RAAS inhibitors. Data showing patterns of use of RAAS inhibitors and associated health outcomes that rigorously account for treatment indication and illness severity among patients with Covid-19 are needed.\nUncertain Effects of RAAS Inhibitors on ACE2 in Humans\nFigure 1.\nInteraction between SARS-CoV-2 and the Renin\u2013Angiotensin\u2013Aldosterone System.\nTissue-specific and circulating components of the RAAS make up a complex intersecting network of regulatory and counterregulatory peptides (Figure 1). ACE2 is a key counterregulatory enzyme that degrades angiotensin II to angiotensin-(1\u20137), thereby attenuating its effects on vasoconstriction, sodium retention, and fibrosis. Although angiotensin II is the primary substrate of ACE2, that enzyme also cleaves angiotensin I to angiotensin-(1\u20139) and participates in the hydrolysis of other peptides.16 In studies in humans, tissue samples from 15 organs have shown that ACE2 is expressed broadly, including in the heart and kidneys, as well as on the principal target cells for SARS-CoV-2 (and the site of dominant injury), the lung alveolar epithelial cells.17 Of interest, the circulating levels of soluble ACE2 are low and the functional role of ACE2 in the lungs appears to be relatively minimal under normal conditions18 but may be up-regulated in certain clinical states.\nBecause ACE inhibitors and ARBs have different effects on angiotensin II, the primary substrate of ACE2, the effects of these agents on ACE2 levels and activity may be anticipated to differ. Despite substantial structural homology between ACE and ACE2, their enzyme active sites are distinct. As a result, ACE inhibitors in clinical use do not directly affect ACE2 activity.19 Experimental animal models have shown mixed findings with respect to the effects of ACE inhibitors on ACE2 levels or activity in tissue.20-25 Similarly, animal models have had inconsistent findings with respect to the effects of ARBs on ACE2, with some showing that ARBs may increase messenger RNA expression or protein levels of ACE2 in tissue21,26-34 and others showing no effect.23\nIn contrast to available animal models, there are few studies in humans regarding the effects of RAAS inhibition on ACE2 expression. In one study, the intravenous administration of ACE inhibitors in patients with coronary artery disease did not influence angiotensin-(1\u20137) production, a finding that calls into question whether ACE inhibitors have any direct effects on ACE2-directed angiotensin II metabolism.35 Similarly, in another study, among patients with hypertension, angiotensin-(1\u20137) levels appeared to be unaffected after initial treatment with the ACE inhibitor captopril; however, with exposure to captopril monotherapy over a period of 6 months, angiotensin-(1\u20137) levels increased.36 Furthermore, few studies have examined plasma ACE2 activity or urinary ACE2 levels in patients who have received long-term treatment with RAAS inhibitors. In cross-sectional studies involving patients with heart failure,37 atrial fibrillation,38 aortic stenosis,39 and coronary artery disease,40 plasma ACE2 activity was not higher among patients who were taking ACE inhibitors or ARBs than among untreated patients. In a longitudinal cohort study involving Japanese patients with hypertension, urinary ACE2 levels were higher among patients who received long-term treatment with the ARB olmesartan than among untreated control patients, but that association was not observed with the ACE inhibitor enalapril or with other ARBs (losartan, candesartan, valsartan, and telmisartan).41 Previous treatment with ACE inhibitors was associated with increased intestinal messenger RNA levels of ACE2 in one study, but that association was not observed with ARBs25; data are lacking regarding the effects of RAAS inhibitors on lung-specific expression of ACE2.\nThese seemingly conflicting data indicate the complexity underlying RAAS responses to pathway modulators and reinforce the concept that findings from preclinical models may not readily translate to human physiology. Such data do suggest that effects on ACE2 should not be assumed to be uniform across RAAS inhibitors or even in response to therapies within a given drug class.41 It is important to note that the plasma ACE2 level may not be a reliable indicator of the activity of the full-length membrane-bound form, in part because ACE2 is shed from the membrane, a process that appears to be separately regulated by an endogenous inhibitor.42 In addition to the degree of expression, the biologic relevance of ACE2 may vary according to tissue and clinical state. Unfortunately, data showing the effects of ACE inhibitors, ARBs, and other RAAS inhibitors on lung-specific expression of ACE2 in experimental animal models and in humans are lacking. Furthermore, even if RAAS inhibitors modify ACE2 levels or activity (or both) in target tissue beds, clinical data are lacking to indicate whether this would in turn facilitate greater engagement and entry of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Further mechanistic studies in humans are needed to better define the unique interplay between SARS-CoV-2 and the RAAS network.\nPotential for Benefit Rather Than Harm of RAAS Blockers in Covid-19\nSARS-CoV-2 appears not only to gain initial entry through ACE2 but also to subsequently down-regulate ACE2 expression such that the enzyme is unable to exert protective effects in organs. It has been postulated but unproven that unabated angiotensin II activity may be in part responsible for organ injury in Covid-19.43,44 After the initial engagement of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, there is subsequent down-regulation of ACE2 abundance on cell surfaces.45 Continued viral infection and replication contribute to reduced membrane ACE2 expression, at least in vitro in cultured cells.46 Down-regulation of ACE2 activity in the lungs facilitates the initial neutrophil infiltration in response to bacterial endotoxin47 and may result in unopposed angiotensin II accumulation and local RAAS activation. Indeed, in experimental mouse models, exposure to SARS-CoV-1 spike protein induced acute lung injury, which is limited by RAAS blockade.45 Other mouse models have suggested that dysregulation of ACE2 may mediate acute lung injury that is secondary to virulent strains of influenza48,49 and respiratory syncytial virus.50 In a small study, patients with Covid-19 appeared to have elevated levels of plasma angiotensin II, which were in turn correlated with total viral load and degree of lung injury.44 Restoration of ACE2 through the administration of recombinant ACE2 appeared to reverse this devastating lung-injury process in preclinical models of other viral infections49,50 and safely reduced angiotensin II levels in a phase 2 trial evaluating acute respiratory distress syndrome in humans.51\nDysregulated ACE2 may theoretically also attenuate cardioprotection in the context of myocardial involvement and abnormal pulmonary hemodynamics52,53 in Covid-19. Markers of myocardial injury have been shown to be elevated during the disease course of Covid-1954 and to increase rapidly with clinical deterioration and preceding death.14 Many viruses are cardiotropic, and subclinical viral myocarditis is commonly seen in viremia associated with a wide range of infectious agents. ACE2 has a well-recognized role in myocardial recovery and injury response; in one study, ACE2 knockout in animal models contributed to adverse left ventricular remodeling in response to acute injury driven by angiotensin II.55 In autopsies of patients who died from SARS, 35% of heart samples showed the presence of viral RNA, which in turn was associated with reduced ACE2 protein expression.56 Administration of recombinant ACE2 normalizes angiotensin II levels in human explanted hearts with dilated cardiomyopathy.57 These hypotheses have prompted trials to test whether the provision of recombinant ACE2 protein may be beneficial in restoring balance to the RAAS network and potentially preventing organ injury (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT04287686\n. opens in new tab\n). In addition, paired trials of losartan as a treatment for Covid-19 are being conducted among patients who have not previously received treatment with a RAAS inhibitor and are either hospitalized (NCT04312009\n. opens in new tab\n) or not hospitalized (NCT04311177\n. opens in new tab\n).\nMaintenance of RAAS Inhibitors with Known or Suspected Covid-19\nDespite these theoretical uncertainties regarding whether pharmacologic regulation of ACE2 may influence the infectivity of SARS-CoV-2, there is clear potential for harm related to the withdrawal of RAAS inhibitors in patients in otherwise stable condition. Covid-19 is particularly severe in patients with underlying cardiovascular diseases,9 and in many of these patients, active myocardial injury,14,54,58-60 myocardial stress,59 and cardiomyopathy59 develop during the course of illness. RAAS inhibitors have established benefits in protecting the kidney and myocardium, and their withdrawal may risk clinical decompensation in high-risk patients.\nAlthough rates of heart failure have been infrequently reported in epidemiologic reports from China to date, the prevalence of heart failure among critically ill patients with Covid-19 in the United States may be high (>40%).59 In the Quinapril Heart Failure Trial, among patients with chronic symptomatic heart failure, withdrawal of quinapril resulted in a progressive decline in clinical status.61 In the TRED-HF trial, among asymptomatic patients with heart failure with recovered left ventricular ejection fraction, the phased withdrawal of medical therapy (including RAAS inhibitors) resulted in rapid relapse of dilated cardiomyopathy.62 In addition, RAAS inhibitors are a cornerstone of therapy after myocardial infarction: maintenance of therapy in the days to weeks after the index event has been shown to reduce early mortality.63 Among patients with unstable clinical status, myocardial injury associated with Covid-19 may pose even higher early risks after withdrawal of RAAS inhibitors.\nWithdrawal of RAAS inhibitors that are being administered for the management of hypertension may be less risky than withdrawal of RAAS inhibitors that are being administered for conditions in which they are considered guideline-directed therapy but may be associated with other challenges. Switching from a RAAS inhibitor to another antihypertensive therapy in a stable ambulatory patient may require careful follow-up to avoid rebound increases in blood pressure. In addition, selection of dose-equivalent antihypertensive therapies may be challenging in practice and may be patient-dependent. Even small and short-lived periods of blood pressure instability after a therapeutic change have been associated with excess cardiovascular risk.64-66 This may be an especially important consideration in patients with Covid-19, which appears to result in a state of RAAS activation,44 and in settings (e.g., China) where baseline blood-pressure control is infrequently reached at the population level.11,12\nThe effects of withdrawing RAAS inhibitors or switching treatments are uncertain among patients with chronic kidney disease. Although reported rates of chronic kidney disease appear to be low among hospitalized patients with Covid-19 in China (1 to 3%) (Table S1), the prevalence may be higher among patients who are critically ill and among those in other geographic regions.59 Many patients have varying degrees of acute kidney injury during illness.14,67,68 For these high-risk patients, individualized treatment decisions regarding the maintenance of RAAS inhibitors that are guided by hemodynamic status, renal function, and clinical stability are recommended.\nOn the basis of the available evidence, we think that, despite the theoretical concerns and uncertainty regarding the effect of RAAS inhibitors on ACE2 and the way in which these drugs might affect the propensity for or severity of Covid-19, RAAS inhibitors should be continued in patients in otherwise stable condition who are at risk for, are being evaluated for, or have Covid-19 (see text box), a position now supported by multiple specialty societies (Table S2). Although additional data may further inform the treatment of high-risk patients with Covid-19, clinicians need to be cognizant of the unintended consequences of prematurely discontinuing proven therapies in response to hypothetical concerns that may be based on incomplete experimental evidence.69\nKEY POINTS RELATED TO THE INTERPLAY BETWEEN COVID-19 AND THE RENIN\u2013ANGIOTENSIN\u2013ALDOSTERONE SYSTEM\n\u2022 ACE2, an enzyme that physiologically counters RAAS activation, is the functional receptor to SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for the Covid-19 pandemic\n\u2022 Select preclinical studies have suggested that RAAS inhibitors may increase ACE2 expression, raising concerns regarding their safety in patients with Covid-19\n\u2022 Insufficient data are available to determine whether these observations readily translate to humans, and no studies have evaluated the effects of RAAS inhibitors in Covid-19\n\u2022 Clinical trials are under way to test the safety and efficacy of RAAS modulators, including recombinant human ACE2 and the ARB losartan in Covid-19\n\u2022 Abrupt withdrawal of RAAS inhibitors in high-risk patients, including those who have heart failure or have had myocardial infarction, may result in clinical instability and adverse health outcomes\n\u2022 Until further data are available, we think that RAAS inhibitors should be continued in patients in otherwise stable condition who are at risk for, being evaluated for, or with Covid-19\nDisclosure forms provided by the authors are available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org.\nThis article was published on March 30, 2020, at NEJM.org.\nAuthor Affiliations\nFrom the Cardiovascular Division, Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital, and Harvard Medical School, Boston (M.V., T.M., M.A.P., S.D.S.); the Center for Care Delivery and Outcomes Research, Minneapolis VA Health Care System, and University of Minnesota, Minneapolis (O.V.); and the British Heart Foundation Cardiovascular Research Centre, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, United Kingdom (J.J.V.M.).\nAddress reprint requests to Dr. Solomon at the Cardiovascular Division, Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital, 75 Francis St., Boston, MA 02115, or at ssolomon@bwh.harvard.edu.\nSupplementary Material\nSupplementary Appendix PDF 150KB\nDisclosure Forms PDF 311KB\nReferences (69)\nCiting Articles (48)", "10.1056/NEJMoa2001282": "26 References\n143 Citing Articles\nLetters\nAbstract\nBACKGROUND\nNo therapeutics have yet been proven effective for the treatment of severe illness caused by SARS-CoV-2.\nMETHODS\nWe conducted a randomized, controlled, open-label trial involving hospitalized adult patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, which causes the respiratory illness Covid-19, and an oxygen saturation (Sao2) of 94% or less while they were breathing ambient air or a ratio of the partial pressure of oxygen (Pao2) to the fraction of inspired oxygen (Fio2) of less than 300 mm Hg. Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either lopinavir\u2013ritonavir (400 mg and 100 mg, respectively) twice a day for 14 days, in addition to standard care, or standard care alone. The primary end point was the time to clinical improvement, defined as the time from randomization to either an improvement of two points on a seven-category ordinal scale or discharge from the hospital, whichever came first.\nRESULTS\nA total of 199 patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection underwent randomization; 99 were assigned to the lopinavir\u2013ritonavir group, and 100 to the standard-care group. Treatment with lopinavir\u2013ritonavir was not associated with a difference from standard care in the time to clinical improvement (hazard ratio for clinical improvement, 1.31; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.95 to 1.80). Mortality at 28 days was similar in the lopinavir\u2013ritonavir group and the standard-care group (19.2% vs. 25.0%; difference, \u22125.8 percentage points; 95% CI, \u221217.3 to 5.7). The percentages of patients with detectable viral RNA at various time points were similar. In a modified intention-to-treat analysis, lopinavir\u2013ritonavir led to a median time to clinical improvement that was shorter by 1 day than that observed with standard care (hazard ratio, 1.39; 95% CI, 1.00 to 1.91). Gastrointestinal adverse events were more common in the lopinavir\u2013ritonavir group, but serious adverse events were more common in the standard-care group. Lopinavir\u2013ritonavir treatment was stopped early in 13 patients (13.8%) because of adverse events.\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn hospitalized adult patients with severe Covid-19, no benefit was observed with lopinavir\u2013ritonavir treatment beyond standard care. Future trials in patients with severe illness may help to confirm or exclude the possibility of a treatment benefit. (Funded by Major Projects of National Science and Technology on New Drug Creation and Development and others; Chinese Clinical Trial Register number, ChiCTR2000029308\n. opens in new tab\n.)\nBeginning in December 2019, a novel coronavirus, designated SARS-CoV-2, has caused an international outbreak of respiratory illness termed Covid-19. The full spectrum of Covid-19 ranges from mild, self-limiting respiratory tract illness to severe progressive pneumonia, multiorgan failure, and death.1-4 Thus far, there are no specific therapeutic agents for coronavirus infections. After the emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003, screening of approved drugs identified lopinavir, a human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type 1 aspartate protease inhibitor, as having in vitro inhibitory activity against SARS-CoV, the virus that causes SARS in humans.5-7 Ritonavir is combined with lopinavir to increase its plasma half-life through the inhibition of cytochrome P450. An open-label study published in 2004 suggested, by comparison with a historical control group that received only ribavirin, that the addition of lopinavir\u2013ritonavir (400 mg and 100 mg, respectively) to ribavirin reduced the risk of adverse clinical outcomes (acute respiratory distress syndrome [ARDS] or death) as well as viral load among patients with SARS.5 However, the lack of randomization and a contemporary control group and the concomitant use of glucocorticoids and ribavirin in that study made the effect of lopinavir\u2013ritonavir difficult to assess. Similarly, lopinavir has activity, both in vitro8 and in an animal model,9 against Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and case reports have suggested that the combination of lopinavir\u2013ritonavir with ribavirin and interferon alfa resulted in virologic clearance and survival.10-12 However, because convincing data about the efficacy of this approach in humans are lacking,12 a clinical trial (with recombinant interferon beta-1b) for MERS is currently under way (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT02845843\n. opens in new tab\n).13-15\nTo evaluate the efficacy and safety of oral lopinavir\u2013ritonavir for SARS-CoV-2 infection, we conducted a randomized, controlled, open-label trial, LOTUS China (Lopinavir Trial for Suppression of SARS-Cov-2 in China), in adult patients hospitalized with Covid-19.\nMethods\nPATIENTS\nPatients were assessed for eligibility on the basis of a positive reverse-transcriptase\u2013polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR) assay (Shanghai ZJ Bio-Tec or Sansure Biotech) for SARS-CoV-2 in a respiratory tract sample tested by the local Center for Disease Control (CDC) or by a designated diagnostic laboratory. Male and nonpregnant female patients 18 years of age or older were eligible if they had a diagnostic specimen that was positive on RT-PCR, had pneumonia confirmed by chest imaging, and had an oxygen saturation (Sao2) of 94% or less while they were breathing ambient air or a ratio of the partial pressure of oxygen (Pao2) to the fraction of inspired oxygen (Fio2) (Pao2:Fio2) at or below 300 mg Hg. Exclusion criteria included a physician decision that involvement in the trial was not in the patient\u2019s best interest, presence of any condition that would not allow the protocol to be followed safely, known allergy or hypersensitivity to lopinavir\u2013ritonavir, known severe liver disease (e.g., cirrhosis, with an alanine aminotransferase level >5\u00d7 the upper limit of the normal range or an aspartate aminotransferase level >5\u00d7 the upper limit of the normal range), use of medications that are contraindicated with lopinavir\u2013ritonavir and that could not be replaced or stopped during the trial period (see the Supplementary Appendix, available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org); pregnancy or breast-feeding, or known HIV infection, because of concerns about the development of resistance to lopinavir\u2013ritonavir if used without combining with other antiretrovirals. Patients who were unable to swallow received lopinavir\u2013ritonavir through a nasogastric tube.\nTRIAL DESIGN AND OVERSIGHT\nThis was an open-label, individually randomized, controlled trial conducted from January 18, 2020, through February 3, 2020 (the date of enrollment of the last patient), at Jin Yin-Tan Hospital, Wuhan, Hubei Province, China. Because of the emergency nature of the trial, placebos of lopinavir\u2013ritonavir were not prepared. Eligible patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either lopinavir\u2013ritonavir (400 mg and 100 mg, orally; freely provided by the national health authority) twice daily, plus standard care, or standard care alone, for 14 days. Standard care comprised, as necessary, supplemental oxygen, noninvasive and invasive ventilation, antibiotic agents, vasopressor support, renal-replacement therapy, and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). To balance the distribution of oxygen support between the two groups as an indicator of severity of respiratory failure, randomization was stratified on the basis of respiratory support methods at the time of enrollment: no oxygen support or oxygen support with nasal duct or mask, or high-flow oxygen, noninvasive ventilation, or invasive ventilation including ECMO. The permuted block (four patients per block) randomization sequence, including stratification, was prepared by a statistician not involved in the trial, using SAS software, version 9.4 (SAS Institute). To minimize allocation bias, we performed allocation concealment with an interactive Web-based response system until randomization was finished on the system through a computer or phone.\nThe trial was approved by the institutional review board of Jin Yin-Tan Hospital. Written informed consent was obtained from all patients or from the patient\u2019s legal representative if the patient was too unwell to provide consent. The trial was conducted in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and the Good Clinical Practice guidelines of the International Conference on Harmonisation. The authors were responsible for designing the trial and for compiling and analyzing the data. The authors vouch for the completeness and accuracy of the data and for the adherence of the trial to the protocol. Full details about the trial design are provided in the protocol, available at NEJM.org.\nCLINICAL AND LABORATORY MONITORING\nPatients were assessed once daily by trained nurses using diary cards that captured data on a seven-category ordinal scale and on safety from day 0 to day 28, hospital discharge, or death. Safety was monitored by the Good Clinical Practice office from Jin Yin-tan Hospital. Other clinical data were recorded using the WHO-ISARIC (World Health Organization\u2013International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infections Consortium) case record form (https://isaric.tghn.org\n. opens in new tab\n).16 Serial oropharyngeal swab samples were obtained on day 1 (before lopinavir\u2013ritonavir was administered) and on days 5, 10, 14, 21, and 28 until discharge or death had occurred and were tested at Teddy Clinical Research Laboratory (Tigermed\u2013DiAn Joint Venture), using quantitative real-time RT-PCR (see the Supplementary Appendix). RNA was extracted from clinical samples with the MagNA Pure 96 system, detected and quantified by Cobas z480 qPCR (Roche), with the use of LightMix Modular SARS-CoV-2 (COVID19) assays (TIB MOBIOL). These samples were obtained for all 199 patients who were still alive at every time point. Sampling did not stop when a swab at a given time point was negative. Baseline throat swabs were tested for detection of E gene, RdRp gene, and N gene, and samples on the subsequent visits were quantitatively and qualitatively detected for E gene. Clinical data were recorded on paper case record forms and then double-entered into an electronic database and validated by trial staff.\nOUTCOME MEASURES\nThe primary end point was the time to clinical improvement, defined as the time from randomization to an improvement of two points (from the status at randomization) on a seven-category ordinal scale or live discharge from the hospital, whichever came first. The end point of clinical improvement was used in our previous influenza study17 and was also recommended by the WHO R&D Blueprint expert group.18 Ordinal scales have been used as end points in clinical trials in patients hospitalized with severe influenza.16-19 The seven-category ordinal scale consisted of the following categories: 1, not hospitalized with resumption of normal activities; 2, not hospitalized, but unable to resume normal activities; 3, hospitalized, not requiring supplemental oxygen; 4, hospitalized, requiring supplemental oxygen; 5, hospitalized, requiring nasal high-flow oxygen therapy, noninvasive mechanical ventilation, or both; 6, hospitalized, requiring ECMO, invasive mechanical ventilation, or both; and 7, death.\nOther clinical outcomes included clinical status as assessed with the seven-category ordinal scale on days 7 and 14, mortality at day 28, the duration of mechanical ventilation, the duration of hospitalization in survivors, and the time (in days) from treatment initiation to death. Virologic measures included the proportions with viral RNA detection over time and viral RNA titer area-under-the-curve (AUC) measurements.\nSafety outcomes included adverse events that occurred during treatment, serious adverse events, and premature discontinuation of treatment. Adverse events were classified according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 4.0.\nSTATISTICAL ANALYSIS\nThe trial was initiated in rapid response to the Covid-19 public health emergency, at which time there was very limited information about clinical outcomes in hospitalized patients with Covid-19. The original total sample size was set at 160, since it would provide the trial with 80% power to detect a difference, at a two-sided significance level of \u03b1=0.05, of 8 days in the median time to clinical improvement between the two groups, assuming that the median time in the standard-care group was 20 days and that 75% of the patients would reach clinical improvement. The planned enrollment of 160 patients in the trial occurred quickly, and the assessment at that point was that the trial was underpowered; thus, a decision was made to continue enrollment by investigators. Subsequently, when another agent (remdesivir) became available for clinical trials, we decided to suspend enrollment in this trial.\nPrimary efficacy analysis was on an intention-to-treat basis and included all the patients who had undergone randomization. The time to clinical improvement was assessed after all patients had reached day 28, with failure to reach clinical improvement or death before day 28 considered as right-censored at day 28 (right-censoring occurs when an event may have occurred after the last time a person was under observation, but the specific timing of the event is unknown). The time to clinical improvement was portrayed by Kaplan\u2013Meier plot and compared with a log-rank test. Hazard ratios with 95% confidence intervals were calculated by means of the Cox proportional-hazards model. Five patients who had been assigned to the lopinavir\u2013ritonavir group did not receive any doses (three of them died within 24 hours) but were included in the intention-to-treat analysis, since no reciprocal removals occurred in the standard-care group. A modified intention-to-treat analysis that excluded three early deaths was also performed. Post hoc analyses include subgroup analysis for National Early Warning Score 2 (NEWS2)19 of 5 or below or greater than 5 and those who underwent randomization up to 12 days or more than 12 days after the onset of illness.\nBecause the statistical analysis plan did not include a provision for correcting for multiplicity in tests for secondary or other outcomes, results are reported as point estimates and 95% confidence intervals. The widths of the confidence intervals have not been adjusted for multiplicity, so the intervals should not be used to infer definitive treatment effects for secondary outcomes. Safety analyses were based on the patients\u2019 actual treatment exposure. Statistical analyses were conducted with SAS software, version 9.4 (SAS Institute).\nResults\nPATIENTS\nFigure 1.\nRandomization and Treatment Assignment.\nOf the 199 patients who underwent randomization, 99 patients were assigned to receive lopinavir\u2013ritonavir and 100 patients to standard care alone. Of the 99 patients assigned to receive lopinavir\u2013ritonavir, 94 (94.9%) received treatment as assigned (Figure 1). In the lopinavir\u2013ritonavir group, 5 patients did not receive any doses of lopinavir\u2013ritonavir: 3 because of early death within 24 hours after randomization and 2 others because the attending physician refused to prescribe lopinavir\u2013ritonavir after randomization.\nTable 1.\nDemographic and Clinical Characteristics of the Patients at Baseline.\nTable 2.\nPatients\u2019 Status and Treatments Received at or after Enrollment.\nThe median age of patients was 58 years (interquartile range [IQR], 49 to 68 years), and 60.3% of the patients were men (Table 1). The median interval time between symptom onset and randomization was 13 days (IQR, 11 to 16 days) (Table 2). There were no important between-group differences in demographic characteristics, baseline laboratory test results, distribution of ordinal scale scores, or NEWS2 scores at enrollment. During the trial, systemic glucocorticoids were administered in 33.0% of the patients in the lopinavir\u2013ritonavir group and in 35.7% of those in the standard-care group.\nPRIMARY OUTCOME\nFigure 2.\nTime to Clinical Improvement in the Intention-to-Treat Population.\nPatients assigned to lopinavir\u2013ritonavir did not have a time to clinical improvement different from that of patients assigned to standard care alone in the intention-to-treat population (median, 16 days vs. 16 days; hazard ratio for clinical improvement, 1.31; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.95 to 1.80; P=0.09) (Figure 2). In the modified intention-to-treat population, the median time to clinical improvement was 15 days in the lopinavir\u2013ritonavir group, as compared with 16 days in the standard-care group (hazard ratio, 1.39; 95% CI, 1.00 to 1.91) (Table S1 and Fig. S1 in the Supplementary Appendix). In the intention-to-treat population, lopinavir\u2013ritonavir treatment within 12 days after the onset of symptoms was not found to be associated with a shorter time to clinical improvement (hazard ratio, 1.25; 95% CI, 0.77 to 2.05); similar results were found regarding later treatment with lopinavir\u2013ritonavir (hazard ratio, 1.30; 95% CI, 0.84 to 1.99) (Fig. S2A and S2B). No significant differences were observed when the time to clinical improvement was assessed by NEWS2 score at entry in the intention-to-treat population (Fig. S3A and S3B). In addition, when the time to clinical deterioration (defined as a one-category increase on the seven-category scale) was compared between the two groups, no difference was observed (hazard ratio for clinical deterioration, 1.01; 95% CI, 0.76 to 1.34) (Fig. S4).\nSECONDARY OUTCOMES\nTable 3.\nOutcomes in the Intention-to-Treat Population.\nThe 28-day mortality was numerically lower in the lopinavir\u2013ritonavir group than in the standard-care group for either the intention-to-treat population (19.2% vs. 25.0%; difference, \u22125.8 percentage points; 95% CI, \u221217.3 to 5.7) or the modified intention-to treat population (16.7% vs. 25.0%; difference, \u22128.3 percentage points; 95% CI, \u221219.6 to 3.0) (Table 3).\nPatients in the lopinavir\u2013ritonavir group had a shorter stay in the intensive care unit (ICU) than those in the standard-care group (median, 6 days vs. 11 days; difference, \u22125 days; 95% CI, \u22129 to 0), and the duration from randomization to hospital discharge was numerically shorter (median, 12 days vs. 14 days; difference, 1 day; 95% CI, 0 to 3). In addition, the percentage of patients with clinical improvement at day 14 was higher in the lopinavir\u2013ritonavir group than in the standard-care group (45.5% vs. 30.0%; difference, 15.5 percentage points; 95% CI, 2.2 to 28.8) (Fig. S5). There were no significant differences for other outcomes such as duration of oxygen therapy, duration of hospitalization, and time from randomization to death.\nVIROLOGY\nFigure 3.\nMean Change from Baseline in SARS-CoV-2 Viral RNA Load by qPCR on Throat Swabs.\nA total of 69 patients (35%) who had a diagnostic respiratory tract sample that was positive on RT-PCR had a negative RT-PCR result on the throat swab taken after consent. The mean (\u00b1SD) baseline viral RNA loads in the throat swabs taken after consent were slightly higher in the lopinavir\u2013ritonavir group than in the standard-care group at randomization (4.4\u00b12.0 log10 copies per milliliter vs. 3.7\u00b12.1) (Table 2). The viral RNA loads over time did not differ between the lopinavir\u2013ritonavir recipients and those receiving standard care (Figure 3), including analysis according to duration of illness (Fig. S6).\nThe percentage of patients with detectable viral RNA for SARS-CoV-2 was similar in the lopinavir\u2013ritonavir group and the standard-care group on any sampling day (day 5, 34.5% vs. 32.9%; day 10, 50.0% vs. 48.6%; day 14, 55.2% vs. 57.1%; day 21, 58.6% vs. 58.6%; and day 28, 60.3% vs. 58.6%) (Table S2).\nSAFETY\nTable 4.\nSummary of Adverse Events in the Safety Population.\nA total of 46 patients (48.4%) in the lopinavir\u2013ritonavir group and 49 (49.5%) in the standard-care group reported adverse events between randomization and day 28 (Table 4). Gastrointestinal adverse events including nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea were more common in lopinavir\u2013ritonavir group than in the standard-care group (Table 4). The percentages of patients with laboratory abnormalities were similar in the two groups (Table 4). Serious adverse events occurred in 51 patients: 19 events in the lopinavir\u2013ritonavir group and 32 events in the standard-care group (Table 4). There were 4 serious gastrointestinal adverse events in the lopinavir\u2013ritonavir group but none in the standard-care group; all 4 events were judged by the investigators to be related to the trial medication. Respiratory failure, acute kidney injury, and secondary infection were more common in patients receiving standard care. All deaths during the observation period were judged by the site investigators to be unrelated to the intervention.\nDiscussion\nThis randomized trial found that lopinavir\u2013ritonavir treatment added to standard supportive care was not associated with clinical improvement or mortality in seriously ill patients with Covid-19 different from that associated with standard care alone. However, in the modified intention-to-treat analysis, which excluded three patients with early death, the between-group difference in the median time to clinical improvement (median, 15 days vs. 16 days) was significant, albeit modest. Of note, the overall mortality in this trial (22.1%) was substantially higher than the 11% to 14.5% mortality reported in initial descriptive studies of hospitalized patients with Covid-19,1,2 which indicates that we enrolled a severely ill population.\nOur patient population was heterogeneous with regard to duration and severity of illness at enrollment. In a post hoc subgroup analysis, the difference in mortality between the lopinavir\u2013ritonavir group and the standard-care group was observed to be numerically greater among patients treated within 12 days after the onset of symptoms than among those treated later. The question of whether earlier lopinavir\u2013ritonavir treatment in Covid-19 could have clinical benefit is an important one that requires further study. The finding is consistent with studies showing that patients with SARS-CoV-2 viral pneumonia have progression in the second week of illness1 and with the time-to-treatment effects observed in previous antiviral studies in SARS20 and severe influenza.21-23 In addition, we found that the numbers of lopinavir\u2013ritonavir recipients who had serious complications (acute kidney injury and secondary infections) or requiring noninvasive or invasive mechanical ventilation for respiratory failure were fewer than in those not receiving treatment. These observations are hypothesis-generating and require additional studies to determine whether lopinavir\u2013ritonavir treatment given at a certain stage of illness can reduce some complications in Covid-19.\nWe did not find that adding lopinavir\u2013ritonavir treatment reduced viral RNA loads or duration of viral RNA detectability as compared with standard supportive care alone. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was still detected in 40.7% of the patients in the lopinavir\u2013ritonavir group at end of the trial (day 28). A recent report showed that the median duration of viral shedding in Covid-19 was 20 days in patients with severe illness and could be as long as 37 days.24 Neither that study nor the current one found evidence that lopinavir\u2013ritonavir exerted a significant antiviral effect. The reasons for the apparent lack of antiviral effect are uncertain, but the sampling methods used in the current trial were most likely suboptimal. Samples were taken only intermittently (on days 1, 5, 10, 14, 21, and 28), and more frequent sampling in the first 5 days could have provided more detailed characterization of viral load kinetics in the two groups over this critical period. In addition, previous studies have shown that throat-swab specimens have lower viral loads than nasopharyngeal samples,25 and importantly, we were unable to do sampling of lower respiratory tract secretions. Of note, depending on cell type used, the 50% effective concentrations (EC50) of lopinavir in vitro for SARS-CoV has ranged from 4.0 to 10.7 \u03bcg per milliliter,5,6,8 although other studies reported that lopinavir was inactive26 or that higher concentrations (25 \u03bcg per milliliter) were required for inhibition.7 For MERS-CoV, the EC50 values have ranged from 5 to approximately 7 \u03bcg per milliliter).1,8,13 Both the mean peak (9.6 \u03bcg per milliliter) and trough (5.5 \u03bcg per milliliter) serum concentrations of lopinavir in adults just approach these concentrations. Whether the EC50 value is an adequate threshold and whether unbound lopinavir concentrations in human plasma are sufficient for inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 are questionable.1\nNearly 14% of lopinavir\u2013ritonavir recipients were unable to complete the full 14-day course of administration. This was due primarily to gastrointestinal adverse events, including anorexia, nausea, abdominal discomfort, or diarrhea, as well as two serious adverse events, both acute gastritis. Two recipients had self-limited skin eruptions. Such side effects, including the risks of hepatic injury, pancreatitis, more severe cutaneous eruptions, and QT prolongation, and the potential for multiple drug interactions due to CYP3A inhibition, are well documented with this drug combination. The side-effect profile observed in the current trial arouses concern about the use of higher or more prolonged lopinavir\u2013ritonavir dose regimens in efforts to improve outcomes.\nOur trial has several limitations. In particular, the trial was not blinded, so it is possible that knowledge of the treatment assignment might have influenced clinical decision-making that could have affected the ordinal scale measurements we used. We will continue to follow these patients to evaluate their long-term prognosis. The characteristics of the patients at baseline were generally balanced across the two groups, but the somewhat higher throat viral loads in the lopinavir\u2013ritonavir group raise the possibility that this group had more viral replication. Although we did not observe differences between groups in the frequency of use of concurrent pharmacologic interventions, such as glucocorticoids, this might have been another confounder. In addition, approximately 45% and 40% of the patients in lopinavir\u2013ritonavir group had positive RNA detection by throat swabs on day 14 and day 28, respectively, but we do not know if infectious virus was still present, since we did not attempt virus isolation or assess the possible emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants with reduced susceptibility to lopinavir. Finally, we do not have data on the lopinavir exposure levels in these seriously and often critically ill patients.\nIn conclusion, we found that lopinavir\u2013ritonavir treatment did not significantly accelerate clinical improvement, reduce mortality, or diminish throat viral RNA detectability in patients with serious Covid-19. These early data should inform future studies to assess this and other medication in the treatment of infection with SARS-CoV-2. Whether combining lopinavir\u2013ritonavir with other antiviral agents, as has been done in SARS5,20 and is being studied in MERS-CoV,15 might enhance antiviral effects and improve clinical outcomes remains to be determined.\nSupported by grants from Major Projects of National Science and Technology on New Drug Creation and Development (2020ZX09201001) and (2020ZX09201012); the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences (CAMS) Emergency Project of Covid-19 (2020HY320001); and a National Science Grant for Distinguished Young Scholars (81425001/H0104).

In late 2019, infection with a novel betacoronavirus, subsequently named SARS-CoV-2, was reported in people who had been exposed to a seafood market in Wuhan, China, where live animals were sold. Since then, there has been rapid spread of the virus, leading to a global pandemic of Covid-19. Here, we discuss the presentation and management of Covid-19 in patients with mild or moderate illness, as well as prevention and control of the infection. Discussion of Covid-19 that occurs in children and during pregnancy and of severe disease is beyond the scope of this article.\nKEY CLINICAL POINTS\nMild or Moderate Covid-19\nCovid-19 (the illness caused by SARS-CoV-2) has a range of clinical manifestations, including cough, fever, malaise, myalgias, gastrointestinal symptoms, and anosmia.\nDiagnosis of Covid-19 is usually based on detection of SARS-CoV-2 by PCR testing of a nasopharyngeal swab or other specimen.\nEvaluation and management of Covid-19 depends on the severity of the disease; patients with mild disease typically recover at home.\nPatients with moderate or severe Covid-19 are usually hospitalized for observation and supportive care.\nThere are no proven therapies for Covid-19; thus, referral of patients to clinical trials is critical.\nInfection control and prevention efforts center on personal protective equipment for health care workers, social distancing, and testing.\nStrategies and Evidence\nCoronaviruses are RNA viruses that are divided into four genera; alphacoronaviruses and betacoronaviruses are known to infect humans.1 SARS-CoV-2 is related to bat coronaviruses and to SARS-CoV-1, the virus that causes severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS).2 Similar to SARS-CoV-1, SARS-CoV-2 enters human cells through the angiotensin-converting\u2013enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor.3 SARS-CoV-2 has RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and proteases, which are targets of drugs under investigation.\nTRANSMISSION\nSARS-CoV-2 is primarily spread from person to person through respiratory droplets, which are typically released when an infected person coughs or sneezes. Because droplets usually fall within a few meters, the likelihood of transmission is decreased if people remain at least 2 m apart. Transmission is thought not to normally occur through the inhalation of aerosols (virions suspended in air), but there are concerns that the virus may be aerosolized during certain activities (e.g., singing)4 or procedures (e.g., intubation or the use of nebulizers) and that it may linger in aerosols for more than 3 hours.5 SARS-CoV-2 RNA has been detected in blood and stool, although fecal\u2013oral spread has not been documented. SARS-CoV-2 may persist on cardboard, plastic, and stainless steel for days.5,6 As a result, contamination of inanimate surfaces may play a role in transmission.4,7\nA major challenge to containing the spread of SARS-CoV-2 is that presymptomatic people are infectious.8 Recent reports suggest that patients may be infectious 1 to 3 days before symptom onset and that up to 40 to 50% of cases may be attributable to transmission from asymptomatic or presymptomatic people.4,9 Just before or soon after symptom onset, patients have high nasopharyngeal viral levels, which then fall over the course of approximately 1 week.10 Patients with severe disease may shed the virus for longer periods, although the duration of infectious viral shedding is unclear.11\nCLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS\nThe median incubation period, from exposure to symptom onset, is approximately 4 to 5 days, and 97.5% of patients who are symptomatic will have symptoms within 11.5 days after infection.12 Symptoms may include fever, cough, sore throat, malaise, and myalgias. Some patients have gastrointestinal symptoms, including anorexia, nausea, and diarrhea.13,14 Anosmia and ageusia have also been reported.15,16 In some series of hospitalized patients, shortness of breath developed a median of 5 to 8 days after initial symptom onset13,17; its occurrence is suggestive of worsening disease.\nRisk factors for complications of Covid-19 include older age (e.g., >65 years), cardiovascular disease, chronic lung disease, hypertension, diabetes, and obesity.17-21 It is unclear whether certain other conditions (kidney disease, immunosuppression, cancer, and uncontrolled human immunodeficiency virus [HIV] infection) confer an increased risk of complications, but because these conditions may be associated with worse outcomes after infection with other respiratory pathogens, close monitoring of patients with Covid-19 who have these conditions is warranted.\nLaboratory findings in hospitalized patients may include lymphopenia and elevated levels of d-dimer, lactate dehydrogenase, C-reactive protein, and ferritin. At presentation, the procalcitonin level is typically normal. Findings associated with poor outcomes in some series include an increasing white-cell count with lymphopenia, a prolonged prothrombin time, and elevated levels of liver enzymes, lactate dehydrogenase, d-dimer, interleukin-6, C-reactive protein, and procalcitonin.13,19,22-24 When abnormalities are present on imaging, the typical findings are ground-glass opacifications or consolidation.25\nDIAGNOSIS\nThe diagnosis of Covid-19 is usually based on the detection of SARS-CoV-2 by means of polymerase-chain-reaction (PCR) assay.26 Soon after symptom onset, the sensitivity of PCR testing of nasopharyngeal swabs appears to be high, but false negatives may occur, with uncertain frequency. If a person is suspected to have Covid-19 but has negative testing of a nasopharyngeal swab, repeat testing is prudent, especially if that person lives in an area with active community transmission.27\nThe type of specimen that is collected depends on which specimens have been validated for use with the specific PCR test. Most PCR assays used in the United States can test nasopharyngeal swabs. (A video\n. opens in new tab\ndemonstrating how to obtain a nasopharyngeal swab specimen is available at NEJM.org.) However, laboratories are increasingly able to test sputum and lower respiratory tract specimens. Sputum samples (or endotracheal aspirates from intubated patients) may be easier to obtain in some settings, and testing of sputum may be more sensitive than testing of a nasopharyngeal swab.28 Sputum induction is contraindicated because of concerns about aerosolization. There are limited data regarding the use of oropharyngeal swabs; in one study, testing of these swabs was less sensitive than testing of nasopharyngeal swabs, particularly later in the disease course.29 If a nasopharyngeal swab cannot be obtained (e.g., because of supply shortages), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends the use of an oropharyngeal swab.30 The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recently recognized on-site self-collection of an anterior nares specimen as an acceptable method of collection31; this option may facilitate home-based testing and reduce exposures for health care workers.\nEVALUATION\nEvaluation and management of Covid-19 is guided by the severity of the illness. According to initial data from China, 81% of people with Covid-19 had mild or moderate disease (including people without pneumonia and people with mild pneumonia), 14% had severe disease, and 5% had critical illness.32\nTable 1.\nEstablished and Potential Risk Factors for Severe Covid-19.\nPatients who have mild signs and symptoms generally do not need additional evaluation, and depending on the risk profile, they may not even need to undergo Covid-19 testing, since the infection will usually resolve. However, some patients who have mild symptoms initially will subsequently have precipitous clinical deterioration that occurs approximately 1 week after symptom onset.17,18 In patients who have risk factors for severe disease (Table 1), close monitoring for clinical progression is warranted, with a low threshold for additional evaluation.\nIf new or worsening symptoms (e.g., dyspnea) develop in patients with initially mild illness, additional evaluation is warranted. A physical examination should be performed to assess for tachypnea, hypoxemia, and abnormal lung findings. In addition, testing for other pathogens (e.g., influenza virus, depending on the season, and other respiratory viruses) should be performed, if available, and chest imaging should be considered.\nIf findings on the initial assessment are suggestive of moderate or severe illness, hospitalization is generally warranted. Patients with moderate disease may have dyspnea, but the blood oxygen saturation is usually at least 94% while the patient is breathing ambient air. Indicators of severe disease are marked tachypnea (respiratory rate, \u226530 breaths per minute), hypoxemia (oxygen saturation, \u226493%; ratio of partial pressure of arterial oxygen to fraction of inspired oxygen, <300), and lung infiltrates (>50% of the lung field involved within 24 to 48 hours).32\nLaboratory testing in hospitalized patients should include a complete blood count and a comprehensive metabolic panel. In most instances, and especially if a medication that affects the corrected QT (QTc) interval is considered, a baseline electrocardiogram should be obtained.\nChest radiography is usually the initial imaging method. Some centers also use lung ultrasonography. The American College of Radiology recommends against the use of computed tomography (CT) as a screening or initial imaging study to diagnose Covid-19, urging that it should be used \u201csparingly\u201d and only in hospitalized patients when there are specific indications.33\nAdditional tests that are sometimes performed include coagulation studies (e.g., d-dimer measurement) and tests for inflammatory markers (e.g., C-reactive protein and ferritin), lactate dehydrogenase, creatine kinase, and procalcitonin. The prognostic value and clinical utility of the results of these and other tests remain uncertain.\nMANAGEMENT OF MILD OR MODERATE COVID-19\nPatients who have mild illness usually recover at home, with supportive care and isolation in accordance with guidelines.34 It may be useful for people who are at high risk for complications to have a pulse oximeter to self-monitor the oxygen saturation.\nPatients who have moderate or severe disease are usually monitored in the hospital. If there is clinical evidence of bacterial pneumonia, empirical antibacterial therapy is a reasonable option but should be stopped as soon as possible. Empirical treatment for influenza may be considered during the period when seasonal influenza transmission is occurring, until results of specific testing are known.\nThere are no approved treatments for Covid-19; thus, people with Covid-19 should be referred to clinical trials. Several agents have been touted as treatments for Covid-19, but at this point, the data are insufficient to inform a recommendation for or against the use of these agents outside of clinical trials; well-conducted randomized trials will be critical in determining how Covid-19 should be treated.\nHydroxychloroquine and Chloroquine with or without Azithromycin\nChloroquine and hydroxychloroquine have in vitro activity against SARS-CoV-2, perhaps by blocking endosomal transport.35 Hydroxychloroquine also has antiinflammatory effects. Chloroquine is recommended in China for the treatment of Covid-19, but high-quality data are lacking to show whether it or hydroxychloroquine is safe and effective for this indication. A small open-label, nonrandomized study from France showed a higher rate of SARS-CoV-2 clearance by day 6 in 14 patients who were treated with hydroxychloroquine than in patients who declined to participate in the study or were at a different clinic. The effects appeared to be greater in the 6 patients who were receiving hydroxychloroquine combined with azithromycin; 6 patients in the hydroxychloroquine group were excluded from the analysis, a factor that potentially biases the results.36 A case series showed high rates of viral clearance and clinical improvement in patients treated with hydroxychloroquine plus azithromycin.37 However, both studies had substantial methodologic limitations, including a lack of adequate comparison groups.\nA small randomized trial showed no significant difference in SARS-CoV-2 clearance or the disease course between the hydroxychloroquine group and the control group.38 Results from additional studies are currently available as non\u2013peer-reviewed preprints. One small trial,39 for which important details are not yet available, showed a modest improvement in the group that received hydroxychloroquine, as compared with a control group, whereas other studies did not show increased viral clearance or clinical benefit with hydroxychloroquine.40,41 Study limitations preclude definitive conclusions. Safety concerns with hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin include the potential for QTc prolongation, which is greater when both agents are used together. A study in which patients received high-dose chloroquine was stopped because of a trend toward excessively high mortality.42\nDetermination of the role of hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin for the treatment of Covid-19 hinges on the results of well-conducted clinical trials. The FDA has issued an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for the use of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine from the strategic national stockpile for the treatment of hospitalized adults with Covid-19, but this action does not constitute FDA approval of these agents for this indication. The EUA encourages the conduct of and participation in randomized, controlled trials to provide evidence for the effectiveness of these drugs for the treatment of Covid-19.\nLopinavir\u2013Ritonavir\nLopinavir\u2013ritonavir, an HIV-1 protease inhibitor, has been proposed as a treatment, but it is not known whether drug levels adequate to inhibit the SARS-CoV-2 protease can be reliably achieved in people with Covid-19 who receive this medication. In an open-label, randomized trial involving 199 hospitalized patients, the addition of lopinavir\u2013ritonavir to standard care did not result in faster clinical improvement or brisker drops in SARS-CoV-2 RNA levels.43 At this time, most experts advise against the use of lopinavir\u2013ritonavir or any other HIV-1 protease inhibitor for the treatment of Covid-19 outside of clinical trials. In addition, people with HIV-1 should be discouraged from changing their antiretroviral regimen to one that includes an HIV-1 protease inhibitor, given the lack of data supporting the use of such drugs for the treatment or prevention of Covid-19.\nRemdesivir\nRemdesivir, an inhibitor of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, has had activity against SARS-CoV-2 in vitro44 and against other coronaviruses in several animal models.45-47 In a case series involving patients with severe Covid-19 who received remdesivir through a compassionate-use program, the majority of patients had a decrease in the need for oxygen support, but there was no comparison group.48 Results of ongoing phase 3, randomized, controlled trials are anticipated.\nImmunomodulation\nBecause of concerns that a hyperinflammatory state may drive many of the severe manifestations of Covid-19, several immunomodulating therapies \u2014 including glucocorticoids, convalescent plasma, and anticytokine therapy \u2014 are under investigation, largely in patients with severe disease. Discussion of these agents is beyond the scope of this article.\nUSE OF CONCOMITANT MEDICATIONS IN PEOPLE WITH COVID-19\nBecause SARS-CoV-2 enters human cells through the ACE2 receptor,3 questions have been raised regarding whether the use of ACE inhibitors or angiotensin-receptor blockers (ARBs) \u2014 which may increase ACE2 levels \u2014 might increase the acquisition of SARS-CoV-2 or the severity of Covid-19.49 However, given the absence of definitive clinical data, the current recommendation is that patients who are receiving ACE inhibitors or ARBs for another indication (e.g., hypertension or heart failure) should not stop taking these agents routinely, even if they have Covid-19.49,50 Some reports have suggested a possible deleterious effect of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs on the course of Covid-19, but several authoritative organizations have noted the absence of clinical data to support this concern.51-53 Concerns have also been raised about the use of glucocorticoids, and some guidelines suggest that they should not be used in patients with Covid-19 pneumonia.54 The use of systemic or inhaled glucocorticoids should not be stopped in patients who are taking them for other indications.54\nINFECTION CONTROL AND PREVENTION\nTable 2.\nSARS-CoV-2 Transmission According to Stage of Infection.\nHealth care workers must be protected from acquiring SARS-CoV-2 when they are providing clinical care (Table 2). Using telehealth when possible, reducing the number of health care workers who interact with infected patients, and performing health care environmental cleaning are critical. Personal protective equipment (PPE) should include, at a minimum, an isolation gown, gloves, a face mask, and eye protection (goggles or a face shield). Although the use of droplet-contact precautions (a gown, gloves, a face mask, and eye protection) for the routine care of patients with Covid-19 is consistent with guidelines from other countries and the World Health Organization (WHO),55-58 the CDC prefers the use of a respirator (usually an N95 filtering facepiece respirator, a powered air-purifying respirator [PAPR] unit, or a contained air-purifying respirator [CAPR] unit) instead of a face mask.59 However, in the context of supply shortages, the CDC regards the use of face masks as an acceptable alternative. The CDC and the WHO both recommend the use of enhanced protection for aerosol-generating procedures, including the use of a respirator and an airborne infection isolation room. At sites where enhanced protection is not available, the use of nebulizers and other aerosol-generating procedures should be avoided, when possible. Recent studies indicating that transmission occurs before symptom onset may support universal droplet-contact precautions for all initial patient encounters.4,60-63\nStrategies to facilitate infection prevention and control are needed for people with unstable housing and people who live in congregate settings, where physical distancing is inconsistent or impossible (e.g., dormitories, jails, prisons, detention centers, long-term care facilities, and behavioral health facilities).\nAreas of Uncertainty\nNumerous uncertainties remain in our understanding of the spread of Covid-19 and its management. The contribution of transmission from asymptomatic and presymptomatic people to the community and nosocomial spread of SARS-CoV-2, and the extent to which fomites and aerosols (those not generated by medical procedures) contribute to transmission, are unclear. Data to inform treatment remain limited. Trials are in progress to assess the effects of various medications \u2014 such as hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin, remdesivir, and favipiravir (which has anti-influenza activity)64 \u2014 on the disease course in patients with different severities of illness, as well as to evaluate hydroxychloroquine as prophylaxis in high-risk or exposed people. Studies are under way to develop an effective vaccine. It is unknown whether infection confers partial or complete immunity (and, if so, for how long) and whether results of serologic testing can be used to inform when health care workers and others can safely return to work.\nGuidelines in a Rapidly Changing Pandemic\nMany professional organizations have developed interim guidelines for the management and prevention of Covid-19 (see the Supplementary Appendix, available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org). Guidelines from the Infectious Diseases Society of America54 and the National Institutes of Health65 highlight the fact that there are no proven therapies for Covid-19 and that randomized trials are critical.\nConclusions and Recommendations\nThe patient in the vignette is at high risk for having Covid-19 with potential complications. Given his dyspnea and risk factors for severe illness, we would refer him for PCR testing of a nasopharyngeal swab for SARS-CoV-2, along with an examination and chest radiography. He should be advised to wear a mask en route; after arrival at a health care facility, he would be given a surgical mask and promptly escorted to an examination room. Admission would be warranted for close monitoring given his dyspnea and increased risk. On the basis of the limited available data, we would continue his ARB and inhaled glucocorticoids. In the absence of high-quality data to support any Covid-19\u2013specific therapy, we would recommend enrollment in a randomized clinical trial, if possible. When the patient\u2019s condition improves sufficiently for discharge, he should be advised to remain isolated for a minimum of 7 days after symptom onset and for at least 3 days after resolution of fever and improvement in respiratory symptoms. There may be additional local guidance regarding the duration of isolation.\nDisclosure forms provided by the authors are available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org.\nThis article was published on April 24, 2020, at NEJM.org.\nWe thank our treasured colleagues Drs.

However, data are limited on how SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19, enters and spreads in a population.\nMETHODS\nWe targeted testing to persons living in Iceland who were at high risk for infection (mainly those who were symptomatic, had recently traveled to high-risk countries, or had contact with infected persons). We also carried out population screening using two strategies: issuing an open invitation to 10,797 persons and sending random invitations to 2283 persons. We sequenced SARS-CoV-2 from 643 samples.\nRESULTS\nAs of April 4, a total of 1221 of 9199 persons (13.3%) who were recruited for targeted testing had positive results for infection with SARS-CoV-2. Of those tested in the general population, 87 (0.8%) in the open-invitation screening and 13 (0.6%) in the random-population screening tested positive for the virus. In total, 6% of the population was screened. Most persons in the targeted-testing group who received positive tests early in the study had recently traveled internationally, in contrast to those who tested positive later in the study. Children under 10 years of age were less likely to receive a positive result than were persons 10 years of age or older, with percentages of 6.7% and 13.7%, respectively, for targeted testing; in the population screening, no child under 10 years of age had a positive result, as compared with 0.8% of those 10 years of age or older. Fewer females than males received positive results both in targeted testing (11.0% vs. 16.7%) and in population screening (0.6% vs. 0.9%). The haplotypes of the sequenced SARS-CoV-2 viruses were diverse and changed over time. The percentage of infected participants that was determined through population screening remained stable for the 20-day duration of screening.\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn a population-based study in Iceland, children under 10 years of age and females had a lower incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection than adolescents or adults and males. The proportion of infected persons identified through population screening did not change substantially during the screening period, which was consistent with a beneficial effect of containment efforts. (Funded by deCODE Genetics\u2013Amgen.)\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) caused clusters of severe respiratory illness in Wuhan, China, in late 2019.1 By January 2020, the virus had been isolated and sequenced,2,3 which revealed close relationships to coronaviruses such as SARS-CoV-14,5 and MERS-CoV.6 As of March 31, researchers had deposited 3095 SARS-CoV-2 sequences in a repository (Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data; GISAID).7 As of April 4, a total of 1,051,635 persons in 208 countries were reported to be infected by SARS-CoV-2, which causes coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19), a disease that had led to more than 75,000 deaths.8 Although the number of new cases has decreased drastically in China, it has rapidly increased in Europe and the United States, with the total number of deaths associated with Covid-19 in Italy, Spain, France, and the United States exceeding that in China.9 On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced that Covid-19 should be characterized as a pandemic.10 At great economic cost, many countries have adopted unprecedented measures to curb the spread of the virus, such as large-scale use of isolation and quarantine, closing borders, imposing limits on public gatherings, and implementing nationwide lockdowns.\nEarly reports from China and Italy indicated that SARS-CoV-2 causes illness of varying degrees,11,12 with females and children being underrepresented among cases, especially among severe and fatal cases. It is unclear whether this is because females and children are less likely to be infected by SARS-CoV-2 or because Covid-19 is less likely to become symptomatic after infection in these demographic groups.\nThe first SARS-CoV-2 infection in Iceland was confirmed on February 28, 2020, in a person who had just returned from northern Italy before that region had been designated as a high-risk area by the Icelandic authorities. Iceland is an island with 364,000 inhabitants, with only one major gateway into the country, the international airport through which 7 million travelers pass each year. On March 19, all travel outside Iceland was designated as high risk. By March 31, a total of 1308 persons in Iceland had tested positive for SARS-CoV-2.13\nIn this study, we used two strategies for SARS-CoV-2 testing in Iceland \u2014 targeted testing of persons at high risk for infection and population screening \u2014 which provided a gauge of success of measures implemented to curb the spread of the virus. We also sequenced the genomes of SARS-CoV-2 from samples obtained from some persons who had tested positive in order to establish the origins of the specific virions spreading in Iceland and to determine how the virus has mutated as it has spread.\nMethods\nSTUDY OVERSIGHT AND DESIGN\nFigure 1.\nStudy Design for Targeted Testing and Population Screening.\nThe study, which was sponsored by deCODE Genetics\u2013Amgen, was approved by the National Bioethics Committee of Iceland. A flowchart outlining the milestones in the study is shown in Figure 1.\nTARGETED TESTING OF PERSONS AT HIGH RISK\nTargeted testing began on January 31, 2020, and involved persons who were deemed to be at high risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Included in this group were mainly persons who were already symptomatic (cough, fever, body aches, and shortness of breath) and who were returning to Iceland from countries or regions that were classified by the health authorities as being at high risk or who had been in contact with infected persons.\nPOPULATION SCREENING\nPopulation screening for SARS-CoV-2 was initiated on March 13 and was open to all residents of Iceland who were symptom-free or who had mild symptoms of the common cold, which is prevalent in Iceland at this time of the year. Registration for the test was performed online. Sample collection was carried out in Reykjavik, the capital of Iceland. Hence, the majority of participants resided in the capital area. During sample collection, a health care worker administered a questionnaire regarding the participant\u2019s recent travels, contacts with infected persons, and symptoms compatible with Covid-19.\nTo evaluate the sampling method of the population screening, we also invited 6782 randomly chosen Icelanders between the ages 20 and 70 years to participate through a telephone text message sent between March 31 and April 1. Of these invitees, 2283 (33.7%) had participated by April 4. Of the invited persons, 2797 (41.2%) were male; of the invitees who participated in the study, 864 (37.8%) were male. Data from the open-invitation subgroup and random-sample subgroup were evaluated separately.\nAll participants who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 were required to self-isolate until 10 days after fever had subsided or until they tested negative, and all contacts of these participants were required to self-quarantine for 2 weeks. (Details regarding these measures are provided in the Supplementary Appendix, available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org.) In addition to isolating participants who had tested positive and quarantining those at high risk for infection, the Icelandic authorities, on March 16, initiated a ban on gatherings of more than 100 persons and stated that social distancing of at least 2 m should be maintained. On March 24, gatherings were restricted to no more than 20 people; to protect the elderly and other groups who are at increased risk for serious illness from Covid-19, health authorities promoted self-isolation and banned visits to nursing homes and hospitals. To date, although universities and colleges have been closed since March 16, day care centers and elementary schools have remained open. The Icelandic authorities have not restricted international travel but have required that returning Icelanders go into quarantine. On March 19, all travel outside Iceland was designated as high-risk.\nTRACKING OF SARS-COV-2 INFECTIONS\nAll the participants who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 were contacted by telephone by a team designated by the authorities to track their infection. The participants were asked about their symptoms and onset, recent travels, and previous contacts with infected persons. They were also asked to identify everyone with whom they had been in contact during the 24 hours before they had noticed their first symptom and to indicate the duration and degree of intimacy of the contact. All registered contacts were interviewed by telephone, asked about their symptoms, and requested to go into 2 weeks of quarantine. Those with symptoms and those in whom symptoms developed in quarantine were tested for SARS-CoV-2.\nACQUISITION AND PREPARATION OF SAMPLES\nWe obtained nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal samples and combined them into a single tube for each participant before RNA isolation. Viral RNA from all samples was isolated within 24 hours, either at the Department of Clinical Microbiology Laboratory at Landspitali\u2013National University Hospital of Iceland (LUH) or at deCODE Genetics. Both extraction methods are based on an automated magnetic bead-purification procedure. Testing for SARS-CoV-2 was performed either at LUH or deCODE Genetics with the use of similar quantitative real-time polymerase-chain-reaction (qRT-PCR) assay methods (see the Supplementary Appendix).\nSEQUENCING\nWe performed reverse transcription and multiplex PCR on the basis of information provided by the Artic Network initiative (https://artic.network/\n. opens in new tab\n) to generate complementary DNA and sequencing libraries using the NEBNext Ultra II kit (New England Biolabs). All samples were sequenced on Illumina MiSeq sequencers with the use of 300-cycle MiSeq v2 reagent kits (Illumina). Details regarding sequencing are provided in the Supplementary Appendix.\nANALYSIS OF SEQUENCING DATA\nWe aligned amplicon sequences to the reference genome of the SARS-CoV-2 (GenBank number, NC_045512.2)2 using the latest Burrows\u2013Wheeler Aligner (BWA-MEM) and variants called with sequencing utilities bcftools14 (see the Supplementary Appendix). The mutations that are listed in Table S3 in the Supplementary Appendix were used to define clades with the use of the joint calling from the Graphtyper.15 For network analysis of haplotypes, we generated a median-joining network8 of SARS-CoV-2 sequences using data from our sequencing effort in Iceland and from GISAID that were available on March 22 (Table S4). To reduce noise in the network, an imputation step was implemented for sequences with missing nucleotides at sites where other sequences varied, in which the missing nucleotide was imputed to the consensus variant for the clade to which it was assigned on the basis of nonmissing sites.\nSTATISTICAL ANALYSIS\nWe used a likelihood ratio method to calculate 95% confidence intervals of fractions with the Clopper\u2013Pearson exact method when the estimated fraction was 0 or 1, as implemented in the R package binom (https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=binom\n. opens in new tab\n). For comparisons of demographic characteristics (sex and age) and symptoms between groups, we used the likelihood ratio method and logistic regression to estimate 95% confidence intervals of odds ratios. In the logistic regression, we used the testing status for SARS-CoV-2 as the response and included the variable assessed as a covariate. In assessing the difference in test status according to sex, we used an indicator for an age of less than 10 years as a covariate. (The setting of the age threshold at 10 years was arbitrary.) We did not adjust confidence intervals for multiple testing.\nResults\nSARS-COV-2 INFECTION\nTable 1.\nStudy Participants in Targeted Testing or Population Screening for SARS-CoV-2, According to Timing.\nFigure 2.\nDistribution of Targeted Testing and Population Screening for SARS-CoV-2 and Percentages of Positive Results, According to Age and Sex.\nOn April 4, 2020, among the 9199 persons who were targeted for testing, 1221 (13.3%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Through population screening, positive results were reported for 100 of 13,080 participants (0.8%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.6 to 1.0); positive test results were reported for 87 of 10,797 persons (0.8%; 95% CI, 0.6 to 1.0) who accepted the open invitation for testing and 13 of 2283 persons (0.6%; 95% CI, 0.3 to 0.9) who were invited at random (Table 1 and Figure 2). The percentage of infected participants that was determined through population screening remained stable for the 20-day duration of screening (Figure 2F).\nSample collection for population screening began on March 13, and the first positive test results were communicated to the Icelandic health authorities on March 15 (Fig. S2). Because of this timing and rapid changes in the definition of high-risk areas by the Icelandic authorities, we report the targeted testing in two phases: early-phase testing (January 31 through March 15) and later-phase testing (March 16 through 31).\nINITIATION OF TESTING\nIn the early targeted testing, 65.0% of the participants who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 had recently traveled outside Iceland. In the later phase, 15.5% had recently traveled outside the country (Table 1 and Fig. S3). Similarly, the proportion of participants in the population screening and who had recently traveled outside the country also fell rapidly during the study period. Overall, 23.0% of those with positive test results through population screening had recently traveled, in contrast to 8.7% of those who tested negative.\nOf the participants who tested positive from the early targeted-testing phase and who had traveled, 86.1% had visited areas designated as being at high risk by the end of February (China and the Alps mountain regions in Austria, Italy, and Switzerland), whereas only 1 of the participants with a positive test identified through population screening had traveled to a high-risk area. The quarantining of persons arriving from these high-risk regions accounted for the very low proportion of participants in the population-screening group who had recently traveled. On the other hand, 12 of 87 participants (13.8%) with positive tests in the screening group had recently traveled to the United Kingdom, as compared with 1.8% of those who tested negative, which suggests relatively early spread of the virus in the U.K. population.\nIn the early phase of targeted testing, 40.1% of the participants who tested positive reported having had contact with a known infected person, as compared with 60.2% in the later phase of targeted testing. However, only 6.9% of the participants in the population-screening group reported having had contact with an infected person, probably because infected persons and their contacts were in isolation and therefore not eligible for the population screening.\nSYMPTOMS OF DISEASE\nAmong the participants with positive results for SARS-CoV-2, symptoms of Covid-19 were reported by 93% of those in the overall targeted-testing group and by 57% of those in the overall population-screening group. However, 29% of participants who tested negative in the overall population-screening group also reported having symptoms. Reports of symptoms became less common among participants in the population screening during the study period (Fig. S4).\nAGE AND VIRAL SUSCEPTIBILITY\nThe mean (\u00b1SD) age of persons who were targeted for testing overall (40.3\u00b118.4 years) was similar to the mean age (39.7\u00b118.0 years) in the overall population-screening group (Figure 2A through 2C). In the two data sets, those who tested positive were older and had a narrower age distribution than the full-participant data set (Table 1). Of the 564 children under the age of 10 years in the targeted testing group, 38 (6.7%) tested positive, in contrast to positive test results in 1183 of 8635 persons who were 10 years of age or older (13.7%). In analyses involving participants up to 20 years of age, we observed a gradual increase with older age in the percentage who tested positive (Fig. S5). In the population-screening group, the difference was even more marked: none of the 848 children under the age of 10 years tested positive, as compared with 100 of 12,232 persons (0.8%; 95% CI, 0.7 to 1.0) 10 years of age or older.\nSEX AND VIRAL SUSCEPTIBILITY\nIn the overall targeted-testing and population-screening groups, more females were tested than males (60.5% and 55.1%, respectively) (Table 1). However, in the targeted testing, the percentage of males who tested positive was greater than that of females (16.7% vs. 11.0%), for an odds ratio of 1.66 (95% CI, 1.47 to 1.87). In the population screening, the relative difference between the sexes was similar (0.9% vs. 0.6%), for an odds ratio of 1.55 (95% CI, 1.04 to 2.30) (Figure 2D and Fig. S6).\nVIRAL HAPLOTYPES\nFigure 3.\nDistribution of Variants across the SARS-CoV-2 Genome, a Median-Joining Network of Haplotypes, and Cumulative Counts from Targeted Testing and Population Screening.\nTable 2.\nDistribution of SARS-CoV-2 Haplotypes, According to Timing of Diagnosis and Internationally Imported or Local Transmission.\nWe sequenced SARS-CoV-2 RNA extracted from 643 samples; of these samples, we obtained coverage of more than 90% of the SARS-CoV-2 genome from 581 samples and more than 67% from 605 samples. We called 409 sequence variants, 291 of which were not found in the GISAID database (Figure 3A). (GISAID accession numbers are provided in the Supplementary Appendix.) We used clade-informative mutations (Table S3) to assign haplotypes to persons: 518 from the targeted-testing group and 59 from the population-screening group (Table 2, Figure 3C, and Fig. S7).\nGEOGRAPHIC VIRAL ORIGIN\nTo shed further light on the geographic origin of the SARS-CoV-2 infections in residents of Iceland, we generated a median-joining network of 1547 complete viral sequences (513 from complete viral genomes from Icelanders and 1034 from other populations around the world) (Figure 3B). Several viral lineages have emerged during the 3 to 4 months since the original outbreak in China, with an average of five mutations separating the lineages from the founding haplotype from Wuhan (the central haplotype of clade A). Although the sequencing efforts vary considerably among populations, it is clear that the geographical distribution of clades is highly structured. Thus, A and B haplotypes are common in East Asia, whereas the B1a haplotype appears to be at the center of the outbreak on the West Coast of the United States, and A2a and its descendants are almost exclusively found in European populations.\nCOMPOSITION OF HAPLOTYPES\nThe haplotypes of SARS-CoV-2 infections observed in Iceland cluster into several diverse clades (Figure 3B). To estimate the number of introductions of the SARS-CoV-2 virus to Iceland, we searched for infected persons who had traveled internationally or had an unknown source of infection. This led us to 363 persons for whom viral genomes had been sequenced. These genomes clustered into 42 distinct clades, which provided a lower boundary on the number of individual introductions.\nOf the 157 sequenced virions obtained during the early targeted testing, 143 were in the A2 clade (Table 2 and Fig. S7). By the time we initiated the population screening, all travelers who had returned from ski resorts in the Alps had been requested to self-quarantine and were not eligible for participation, which resulted in a substantially different composition of haplotypes. For example, the A2a2 haplotype, which was most commonly seen in travelers coming from Austria in the early phase of targeted testing, was much less frequent in travelers in the population screening. The A1a haplotype was more common in the general population than in those who received targeted testing, with a total of 23 of 59 haplotypes among participants in the population-screening group, as compared with only 8 of 157 haplotypes in the early-targeted testing.\nThe composition of haplotypes changed substantially from early targeted testing to later targeted testing. The A2a1 and A2a2 haplotypes, which had collectively made up 103 of 157 haplotypes (65.6%) in the early-targeted testing, were reduced to 115 of 361 haplotypes (31.9%) in the later-targeted testing, mostly because of the increased frequency of the A1a and other A2a-derived haplotypes. This change probably meant that population screening identified clusters of infected persons who seeded infection from areas that had not been designated as high risk, such as the United Kingdom. The relatively high prevalence of A1a and A2a clades in the later-targeted testing group was unsurprising: the targeted testing had been extended to include those who had traveled to additional high-risk areas, and population screening had identified cases that could be used to inform tracking efforts. The A2a3a and A2a2a haplotypes were the two most common haplotypes in Iceland; of the 577 persons who provided samples that were sequenced, the A2a3a haplotype was found in 78 (13.5%) and the A2a2a haplotype was found in 45 (7.8%).\nHAPLOTYPE ANALYSIS OF CONTACT-TRACING NETWORKS\nFigure 4.\nOverall Clusters in the Contact-Tracing Network, a Network Cluster Including a Novel Domestic Mutation, and Source of Exposure.\nHaplotype analysis that was based on SARS-CoV-2 sequences overlaid on contact-tracing networks16 showed concordance between the contacts identified by the tracking team and those based on viral sequences (Figure 4A). Of the 369 pairs of persons found through contact tracing, 295 were consistent with the sequence data (i.e., their haplotypes differed by strictly less than 3 mutations).\nFigure 4B shows one of the most complex contact-tracing networks, in which clusters of persons returning from Italy or Austria transmitted the virus to persons in Iceland. The figure shows a network of 14 persons who were infected in Iceland. Haplotype analysis showed that these persons were infected by viruses with the A2a1 haplotype, more commonly imported from northern Italy than from Austria (Table 2). This cluster also contained persons with a mutation that was specific to Iceland. The cluster can be traced to a person who had both mutated and wild-type haplotypes; those whom this person infected had only the mutated haplotype. We searched for persons carrying these mutations who were not associated with this cluster and found two who had probably been infected by someone in the cluster through an unknown contact.\nCONTACT TRACING AND EXPOSURE TYPE\nWe categorized exposure into six categories: family, social, tourism (working in the travel industry in Iceland), work (including schools), travel (international), and unknown and observed a shift in the composition of exposures from international travel and social exposure to familial exposure over time (Figure 4C).\nDiscussion\nIn Iceland, the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection among persons at high risk for infection and the stability of the infection rate in the general population provide grist for both assurance and alarm. The percentage of participants who tested positive in population screening remained stable (0.8%) over the course of 20 days, and the infection rates in the two screening groups (recruited through open invitation and through random sampling) were not substantially different. These results were consistent with a slow spread of SARS-CoV-2 through the Icelandic population.\nThe lack of increase in the incidence of infection over time may be due to containment efforts by the Icelandic health care authorities and their nimble response to the outbreak abroad. Testing of exposed persons with symptoms had been carried out for 1 month before the first SARS-CoV-2 case was identified in Iceland. Self-isolation, quarantining, and other social-distancing measures may also have helped to prevent an increase in the infection rate.\nAlthough we asked participants who had respiratory symptoms that they described as more than mild not to participate in population screening, close to half the participants reported symptoms, most commonly rhinorrhea and coughing. Thus, a weakness in the design of the population-screening component of the study was that persons who were concerned about potential infection may have been more likely to participate than others. Symptoms were common both in participants who tested positive and in those who tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 in the overall population-screening group. Notably, 43% of the participants who tested positive reported having no symptoms, although symptoms almost certainly developed later in some of them. During the study, the prevalence of symptoms decreased considerably in both testing groups (despite the stability of the SARS-CoV-2 infection rate), probably owing to a general decrease in other respiratory infections, which in turn may have been brought about through measures implemented to decrease the spread of SARS-CoV-2.\nYoung children and females were less likely to test positive for SARS-CoV-2 than adolescents or adults and males. Whether the lower incidence of positive results in these two groups resulted from less exposure to the virus or from biologic resistance is not known. In other studies, investigators have found that infected children and females were less likely to have severe disease than adults and males, respectively.11,12\nThe haplotype composition of the viruses from persons who were identified through population screening was different from that of viruses infecting persons who tested positive in the early phase of targeted testing, so we conclude that the haplotypes of the virus that were propagating in the general population came from a different source (as compared with those infecting high-risk persons in the early phase of targeted testing), perhaps brought into Iceland by persons arriving from countries that had not yet been designated as high-risk areas.\nThus, the frequency of the SARS-CoV-2 infection in the overall Icelandic population was stable from March 13 to April 1, a finding that appears to indicate that the containment measures had been working. However, the virus has spread to the extent that unless we continue to test and isolate, track contacts, and quarantine, we are likely to fail in our efforts to contain the virus.\nSupported by deCODE Genetics\u2013Amgen.\nDisclosure forms provided by the authors are available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org.\nDrs.

Case series have indicated that hypertension, diabetes, and coronary artery disease \u2014 conditions for which clinicians often prescribe RAAS inhibitors \u2014 are more common in patients with severe Covid-19 than in those with milder illness.6 Coverage of the hypothesis by the press and some websites has emphasized the theoretical risk with statements such as, \u201cPeople with high blood pressure and diabetes could be at higher risk of severe or fatal coronavirus symptoms because of how their medicines work, scientists say,\u201d7 and, \u201c[Reports suggest that] you are four times as likely to die from Covid-19 if you are taking one of these drugs, prior to contracting the virus.\u201d8\nSign up for the Weekly Table of Contents email.\nEach week, receive an email with links to the articles published in the current week's issue of the New England Journal of Medicine. SIGN UP\nIn this rapidly evolving setting, clinicians are weighing the alleged harm of continuing these medications in patients for whom ACE inhibitors and ARBs have known benefit against the harm to their cardiovascular and kidney health associated with discontinuing them. Three articles now published in the Journal provide data about whether ACE inhibitors and ARBs are indeed harmful in the context of the Covid-19 epidemic. All are observational studies with the looming possibility of confounding, but each has unique strengths, and their message is consistent \u2014 none of the three studies showed evidence of harm with continued use of ACE inhibitors and ARBs.\nMehra et al.9 conducted a database study involving patients who had been hospitalized in 11 countries on three continents. The study included 8910 patients who had received a diagnosis of Covid-19, who had been admitted to the hospital between December 20, 2019, and March 15, 2020, and who had either died in the hospital or survived to hospital discharge. In multivariate logistic-regression analysis, an age greater than 65 years, coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, history of cardiac arrhythmia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and current smoking were associated with an increased risk of in-hospital death. Female sex was associated with a decreased risk. Neither ACE inhibitors nor ARBs were associated with an increased risk of in-hospital death. A secondary analysis that was restricted to patients with hypertension (those for whom an ACE inhibitor or ARB would be indicated) also did not show harm.\nMancia et al.10 conducted a case\u2013control study involving patients with confirmed Covid-19 in the Lombardy region of Italy, which has been severely affected by the pandemic. In this analysis, 6272 people with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection that had been diagnosed between February 21 and March 11, 2020, were compared with 30,759 controls who were matched according to age, sex, and municipality of residence. In a conditional logistic-regression multivariate analysis, neither ACE inhibitors nor ARBs were associated with the likelihood of SARS-CoV-2 infection. An additional analysis comparing patients with severe or fatal infections with matched controls also did not show an association between these drugs and severe Covid-19.\nReynolds et al.11 conducted a study based on data from the electronic health records of 12,594 patients in the New York University (NYU) Langone Health system who were tested for Covid-19 between March 1 and April 15, 2020. A total of 5894 patients had a positive test, among whom 1002 had severe illness (defined as admission to the intensive care unit, mechanical ventilation, or death). Propensity-score matching was performed among all tested patients and among patients with hypertension (to assess whether the likelihood of a positive test result was associated with each of several antihypertensive drug classes), as well as among Covid-19\u2013positive patients and all such patients with hypertension (to assess whether the likelihood of severe illness among those with a positive test was associated with the same drug classes). The investigators\u2019 Bayesian analysis showed no positive association for any of the analyzed drug classes, including ACE inhibitors and ARBs, for either a positive test result or severe illness.\nTaken together, these three studies do not provide evidence to support the hypothesis that ACE inhibitor or ARB use is associated with the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection, the risk of severe Covid-19 among those infected, or the risk of in-hospital death among those with a positive test. Each of these studies has weaknesses inherent in observational data, but we find it reassuring that three studies in different populations and with different designs arrive at the consistent message that the continued use of ACE inhibitors and ARBs is unlikely to be harmful in patients with Covid-19. Several other smaller studies from China and the United Kingdom have come to the same conclusion.12-15\nWe note that Mehra et al. found that use of either ACE inhibitors or statins may be associated with a lower risk of in-hospital death than nonuse, but neither of the other two studies estimated a lower risk of Covid-19 or the likelihood of a positive test among patients treated with these agents. The unexpected result in the study by Mehra et al. may be due to unmeasured confounding and, in the absence of a randomized trial, should not be regarded as evidence to prescribe these drugs in patients with Covid-19.\nProfessional scientific societies and experts have spoken with one voice in advising that patients should not discontinue ACE inhibitor or ARB therapy out of a concern that they are at increased risk for infection, severe illness, or death during the Covid-19 pandemic.16-18 The data from these three studies support those recommendations. Ultimately, one or more randomized trials will be needed to answer definitively the question of whether ACE inhibitors or ARBs pose a harm to patients with Covid-19.\nDisclosure forms provided by the authors are available with the full text of this editorial at NEJM.org.\nThis editorial was published on May 1, 2020, at NEJM.org.\nAuthor Affiliations\nFrom the Department of Mathematics and Statistics, Boston University (R.B.D.), the Department of Biostatistics, Harvard T.H.

An increasing number of frontline providers are wondering whether this effort should include universal use of masks by all health care workers. Universal masking is already standard practice in Hong Kong, Singapore, and other parts of Asia and has recently been adopted by a handful of U.S. hospitals.\nWe know that wearing a mask outside health care facilities offers little, if any, protection from infection. Public health authorities define a significant exposure to Covid-19 as face-to-face contact within 6 feet with a patient with symptomatic Covid-19 that is sustained for at least a few minutes (and some say more than 10 minutes or even 30 minutes). The chance of catching Covid-19 from a passing interaction in a public space is therefore minimal. In many cases, the desire for widespread masking is a reflexive reaction to anxiety over the pandemic.\nSign up for the Weekly Table of Contents email.\nEach week, receive an email with links to the articles published in the current week's issue of the New England Journal of Medicine. SIGN UP\nThe calculus may be different, however, in health care settings. First and foremost, a mask is a core component of the personal protective equipment (PPE) clinicians need when caring for symptomatic patients with respiratory viral infections, in conjunction with gown, gloves, and eye protection. Masking in this context is already part of routine operations for most hospitals. What is less clear is whether a mask offers any further protection in health care settings in which the wearer has no direct interactions with symptomatic patients. There are two scenarios in which there may be possible benefits.\nThe first is during the care of a patient with unrecognized Covid-19. A mask alone in this setting will reduce risk only slightly, however, since it does not provide protection from droplets that may enter the eyes or from fomites on the patient or in the environment that providers may pick up on their hands and carry to their mucous membranes (particularly given the concern that mask wearers may have an increased tendency to touch their faces).\nMore compelling is the possibility that wearing a mask may reduce the likelihood of transmission from asymptomatic and minimally symptomatic health care workers with Covid-19 to other providers and patients. This concern increases as Covid-19 becomes more widespread in the community. We face a constant risk that a health care worker with early infection may bring the virus into our facilities and transmit it to others. Transmission from people with asymptomatic infection has been well documented, although it is unclear to what extent such transmission contributes to the overall spread of infection.1-3\nMore insidious may be the health care worker who comes to work with mild and ambiguous symptoms, such as fatigue or muscle aches, or a scratchy throat and mild nasal congestion, that they attribute to working long hours or stress or seasonal allergies, rather than recognizing that they may have early or mild Covid-19. In our hospitals, we have already seen a number of instances in which staff members either came to work well but developed symptoms of Covid-19 partway through their shifts or worked with mild and ambiguous symptoms that were subsequently diagnosed as Covid-19. These cases have led to large numbers of our patients and staff members being exposed to the virus and a handful of potentially linked infections in health care workers. Masking all providers might limit transmission from these sources by stopping asymptomatic and minimally symptomatic health care workers from spreading virus-laden oral and nasal droplets.\nWhat is clear, however, is that universal masking alone is not a panacea. A mask will not protect providers caring for a patient with active Covid-19 if it\u2019s not accompanied by meticulous hand hygiene, eye protection, gloves, and a gown. A mask alone will not prevent health care workers with early Covid-19 from contaminating their hands and spreading the virus to patients and colleagues. Focusing on universal masking alone may, paradoxically, lead to more transmission of Covid-19 if it diverts attention from implementing more fundamental infection-control measures.\nSuch measures include vigorous screening of all patients coming to a facility for symptoms of Covid-19 and immediately getting them masked and into a room; early implementation of contact and droplet precautions, including eye protection, for all symptomatic patients and erring on the side of caution when in doubt; rescreening all admitted patients daily for signs and symptoms of Covid-19 in case an infection was incubating on admission or they were exposed to the virus in the hospital; having a low threshold for testing patients with even mild symptoms potentially attributable to a viral respiratory infection (this includes patients with pneumonia, given that a third or more of pneumonias are caused by viruses rather than bacteria); requiring employees to attest that they have no symptoms before starting work each day; being attentive to physical distancing between staff members in all settings (including potentially neglected settings such as elevators, hospital shuttle buses, clinical rounds, and work rooms); restricting and screening visitors; and increasing the frequency and reliability of hand hygiene.\nThe extent of marginal benefit of universal masking over and above these foundational measures is debatable. It depends on the prevalence of health care workers with asymptomatic and minimally symptomatic infections as well as the relative contribution of this population to the spread of infection. It is informative, in this regard, that the prevalence of Covid-19 among asymptomatic evacuees from Wuhan during the height of the epidemic there was only 1 to 3%.4,5 Modelers assessing the spread of infection in Wuhan have noted the importance of undiagnosed infections in fueling the spread of Covid-19 while also acknowledging that the transmission risk from this population is likely to be lower than the risk of spread from symptomatic patients.3 And then the potential benefits of universal masking need to be balanced against the future risk of running out of masks and thereby exposing clinicians to the much greater risk of caring for symptomatic patients without a mask. Providing each health care worker with one mask per day for extended use, however, may paradoxically improve inventory control by reducing one-time uses and facilitating centralized workflows for allocating masks without risk assessments at the individual-employee level.\nThere may be additional benefits to broad masking policies that extend beyond their technical contribution to reducing pathogen transmission. Masks are visible reminders of an otherwise invisible yet widely prevalent pathogen and may remind people of the importance of social distancing and other infection-control measures.\nIt is also clear that masks serve symbolic roles. Masks are not only tools, they are also talismans that may help increase health care workers\u2019 perceived sense of safety, well-being, and trust in their hospitals. Although such reactions may not be strictly logical, we are all subject to fear and anxiety, especially during times of crisis. One might argue that fear and anxiety are better countered with data and education than with a marginally beneficial mask, particularly in light of the worldwide mask shortage, but it is difficult to get clinicians to hear this message in the heat of the current crisis. Expanded masking protocols\u2019 greatest contribution may be to reduce the transmission of anxiety, over and above whatever role they may play in reducing transmission of Covid-19. The potential value of universal masking in giving health care workers the confidence to absorb and implement the more foundational infection-prevention practices described above may be its greatest contribution.\nDisclosure forms provided by the authors are available at NEJM.org.\nThis article was published on April 1, 2020, at NEJM.org.\nAuthor Affiliations\nFrom the Department of Population Medicine, Harvard Medical School and Harvard Pilgrim Health Care Institute (M.K.), Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital (M.K., C.A.M., J.S., M.P.), Harvard Medical School (M.K., C.A.M., E.S.S.), and the Infection Control Unit and Division of Infectious Diseases, Massachusetts General Hospital (E.S.S.) \u2014 all in Boston.\nSupplementary Material\nDisclosure Forms PDF 122KB\nReferences (5)\nCiting Article (1)", "10.1056/NEJMp2005234": "4 References\nOn January 20, 2020, the first U.S. case of Covid-19 was reported in Washington State. Substantial challenges lay ahead. Covid-19 is highly contagious, it can cause severe illness, and no proven, effective treatments or vaccines are available. As leaders at the University of Washington (UW) and UW Medicine prepared for a tsunami of patients, there was extensive discussion about the role of students and trainees (residents and fellows) in our response. How should clinical and educational imperatives be balanced with their safety and well-being?\nRisk is inherent in medicine \u2014 for patients and for health care workers. Usually risks to clinicians are small, manageable, and accepted by these workers as part of their responsibility to act in a patient\u2019s best interest. But providing care to patients with communicable diseases can be frightening. Today\u2019s medical leaders remember the anxiety involved in caring for patients who were dying of an infectious disease with an unknown cause during the early years of the AIDS epidemic.1 More recent outbreaks (including H1N1 influenza, SARS, and Ebola) have further reminded clinicians of the personal risks they face when caring for patients.\nSign up for the Weekly Table of Contents email.\nEach week, receive an email with links to the articles published in the current week's issue of the New England Journal of Medicine. SIGN UP\nThe Covid-19 outbreak has required us to address questions about students\u2019 and trainees\u2019 involvement in the care of infectious patients. The high probability that medical students in the hospital would be exposed to Covid-19 and the need to conserve personal protective equipment (PPE) seemed to outweigh the educational benefits of students\u2019 participation. This assessment prompted UW senior leaders to remove medical students from clinical rotations on March 16. The following day, the Association of American Medical Colleges recommended that member schools suspend clinical rotations for medical students for at least 2 weeks; this recommendation was recently extended through at least April 14, 2020.2 Involvement of residents and fellows in Covid-19 care has varied by specialty and is rapidly evolving. Some of these trainees may be caring for patients with Covid-19 during assigned rotations. When there is a surge in Covid-19 cases, others may be voluntarily redeployed to services with these patients.\nTo learn more about how Covid-19 is affecting our students and trainees, we conducted a brief, anonymous survey and received responses from 316 third- and fourth-year medical students, interns and residents in internal medicine and emergency medicine, and fellows in pulmonary and critical care at our institution. A sampling of the responses we received is shown in the box, and additional responses are presented in the Supplementary Appendix (available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org).\nSURVEY RESPONSES FROM UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON AND UW MEDICINE MEDICAL STUDENTS, RESIDENTS, AND FELLOWS.*\nStudents and trainees were asked to describe what \u2014 if any \u2014 unique or challenging ethical or practical challenges they have experienced as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic and how they have responded.

One internal medicine resident wrote, \u201cIt\u2019s a constant dialogue of \u2018Am I safe? Is my patient safe? Is this care adequate? Am I doing all I can?\u2019 All of this takes a serious toll on the psyche of trainees, and it\u2019s an impact that will likely be felt for a long time.\u201d\nSafety concerns among residents and fellows are complicated by the recognition that their decisions have implications for their loved ones and others outside the hospital. Some worry about transmitting infection to others in their homes. Feelings of vulnerability are exacerbated by rapidly changing conditions and recommendations. Fear of potential PPE shortages was prominent.\nCovid-19 has brought forward new ethical dilemmas for trainees, some of whom are considering the implications of intubating certain patients when ventilators are in short supply or wondering whether they should join an attending for procedures that would help them fulfill criteria to sit for board exams but would require the use of additional PPE. Many students reported moral distress associated with watching patients be isolated from loved ones and described feeling distant from patients while wearing PPE. Trainees not providing Covid-19 care because of personal health issues expressed guilt that colleagues had to step in. Students frequently reported disappointment and frustration about not being able to help. Many people faced challenges that were largely practical, such as needing child care.\nEspecially for fourth-year students, apprehension about \u201cbeing rusty\u201d and maintaining skills that will be required when they begin their internships shortly loomed large. Students also expressed other practical concerns, such as whether they would graduate on time or maintain financial aid. Students\u2019 desire to help has driven them to volunteer to support the school\u2019s clinical mission and community, by preparing home care kits for patients with Covid-19, for example, or by providing child care for health care workers.\nFeelings of anxiety and vulnerability among students and trainees compete internally with a desire and commitment to serve the sick. Many have done more than has been required of them for patient care and within the community, despite risks and challenges. When one program called on residents to fill extra shifts through the end of April, all slots were filled by volunteers within 10 minutes.\nMoving forward, leaders in medical education can communicate frequently with students and trainees to maximize the information and emotional support they receive. Students and trainees are experiencing intense anxiety, uncertainty, and anticipatory loss. Leaders should create safe spaces for them to share their concerns, acknowledge and validate their emotions, and collaborate on innovative ways to contribute. Leaders can provide trainees who are unable to participate in Covid-19 care because of personal health issues with other options for helping, such as caring for outpatients through telemedicine. Throughout the pandemic, leaders should maximize students\u2019 and trainees\u2019 control over their involvement in Covid-19 care where possible.\nThe Covid-19 crisis is a teachable moment. Chaos and uncertainty demand an unyielding focus on core medical principles and consistent modeling of professionalism, altruism, quality, and safety. Bioethical issues that previously seemed theoretical, such as rationing and futility of care, are being brought to life during this crisis. Educators can proactively teach students and trainees about strategies for improving end-of-life care, allocating scarce resources, and caring for patients who are noncompliant with self-quarantine recommendations. Leaders should also anticipate pointed questions from students and trainees about Covid-19 policies and procedures and respond with respect and openness.\nAs the health care system becomes more adept at providing Covid-19 care, there will be innovative ways to assimilate students into care processes. Several schools are allowing fourth-year medical students to graduate early or return to the clinical environment to help address impending staff shortages. The efficacy of this approach will hinge on the ability to safely deploy these young clinicians in ways that don\u2019t require time-consuming supervision, as well as on the response of accrediting bodies. Medical schools should ensure that their fourth-year students arrive at their internships ready to be effective members of Covid-19 teams.\nDown the road, disruptions such as Covid-19 will prompt us to revisit routines and traditions. Which of the new practices that are being developed during the Covid-19 pandemic can be adopted more broadly to enhance educational and clinical experiences? How do we simultaneously provide the safest care and the safest education? What is the role of new technology and other innovations in the future of medical care and clinical learning?3\nMedicine and medical education are based on a strong tradition of partnership and of one generation passing down knowledge to the next. Students and trainees have experienced considerable loss \u2014 loss of routines and traditions, expertise, educational opportunities, and social connections \u2014 and many are witnessing frequent loss of life. Most are worried about more losses yet to come in all these areas.\nBut amid loss, there is hope. In their seminal paper on AIDS and occupational risk for physicians, Zuger and Miles wrote, \u201cMedicine is an inherently moral enterprise, the success and future of which depend to a great extent on the integrity of individual professionals as they face the duties the calling of healer entails.\u201d4 Watching our students and trainees step up during the Covid-19 pandemic despite their fears gives us hope that the profession\u2019s future is in good hands.\nDisclosure forms provided by the authors are available at NEJM.org.\nThis article was published on April 8, 2020, at NEJM.org.\nAuthor Affiliations\nFrom the Departments of Medicine (T.H.G., A.M.S.) and Bioethics (T.H.G.), University of Washington School of Medicine, and UW Medicine (A.M.S.) \u2014 both in Seattle.\nSupplementary Material\nSupplementary Appendix PDF 137KB\nDisclosure Forms PDF 75KB\nReferences (4)", "10.1056/NEJMe2006742": "1 Citing Article\nAudio Interview\nInterview with Dr. Eric Rubin and Dr. Lindsey Baden on practical measures to help prevent Covid-19.

SIGN UP\nThis statement may feel like vindication for those of us who have been warning about the negative impact of anti-immigration policies on public health,2 but we fear this change is too little, too late. Under the Trump administration, immigrants have faced relentless attacks \u2014 tightening of the public charge rule, threats to the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, raids by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), asylum restrictions, and separation of families at the border \u2014 so immigrants are justifiably scared. Expecting them to trust the government now, during the Covid-19 crisis, is naive at best. As community organizations, activists, and health care providers scramble to reach out to immigrants and encourage them to seek care for Covid-19 if necessary, we are using mitigation strategies that will not compensate for years of harm.\nCovid-19 has exposed weaknesses in the U.S. health system. The country faces shortages of personal protective equipment, tests, and ventilators. As emergency departments (EDs) and intensive care units brace for surges in volume, public health officials urge people with symptoms to stay home and call their doctor before seeking in-person medical care. Unfortunately, for many undocumented immigrants, calling their doctor is not an option. The Affordable Care Act excludes undocumented immigrants from eligibility for coverage, and an estimated 7.1 million undocumented immigrants lack health insurance.3 As a result, many undocumented immigrants do not have primary care providers (PCPs) and have had to rely on EDs for years. Telling people now to avoid EDs and call their doctors leaves those without PCPs in limbo. The Covid-19 epidemic has exposed the risk of limiting access to primary care for segments of the population, including undocumented immigrants.\nFor most people, Covid-19 is a mild illness that can be managed at home. Limiting unnecessary visits to clinics and EDs will save resources for people who really need them and reduce potential exposures and ongoing transmission. It\u2019s important, however, that people who are vulnerable to serious infection \u2014 the elderly and those with chronic medical conditions \u2014 contact providers to determine the need for testing or monitoring. Although the immigrant community tends to be young and healthy, the prevalence of diabetes, a risk factor for severe Covid-19, is 22% among Latinos, the highest for any U.S. racial or ethnic group.4\nGiven the collective anxiety regarding the epidemic, even low-risk patients may benefit from talking to their clinicians about symptoms, getting reassurance, and discussing an appropriate plan of care. Without a PCP to call, many uninsured immigrants will resort to online information, whether accurate or inaccurate; some will go to the ED, perhaps unnecessarily; and others will wait too long to seek care. Under the Public Health Service Act, the United States could provide free Covid-19 care in response to a public health emergency. It\u2019s still unclear how this provision will be applied to this epidemic, however, and for uninsured people, worries about out-of-pocket costs will hinder testing and care, especially as jobs evaporate. Even among those with a PCP, the rapid transition to telemedicine will be difficult for patients with limited English proficiency who may lack access to computers for videoconferencing and have to rely on telephonic visits involving interpreters, without the benefit of visual cues.\nAs the country has adopted a suppression strategy, people have been asked to stay home as much as possible. The profound economic impact of these measures will be especially harsh for undocumented immigrants, many of whom work in service industries such as restaurants and hotels, or in the informal economy. Many immigrants will have no income and are excluded from the social safety net. Extreme poverty will extend to the more than 5 million U.S.-born children who have undocumented-immigrant parents. The $1 trillion economic relief package, which includes paid-leave benefits and direct cash for Americans, will not reach most undocumented immigrants or their families.\nThe disenrollment of immigrant families from SNAP over the past year takes on new meaning in light of the economic crisis resulting from Covid-19. With children home from school, the U.S. Department of Agriculture Food and Nutrition Service has relaxed guidelines to enable summer food service and national school lunch programs to serve meals in noncongregate settings, but children of immigrants who disenrolled in SNAP will not receive these services.\nAccording to one study, 8.3 million U.S. children live in households with at least one noncitizen adult and are at risk of losing Medicaid or Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program (CHIP) benefits, household nutrition assistance, or both.5 Maryland Medicaid has stated that children due to re-enroll in March will be kept enrolled, given the barriers to re-enrollment. The Maryland Department of Social Services has not yet done the same for SNAP enrollees; its offices are closed, and online and telephone enrollment are particularly problematic for immigrant parents.\nFinally, the Trump administration must address dire conditions in immigration detention centers. Under public pressure, ICE announced on March 18 that its \u201chighest priorities are to promote life-saving and public safety activities,\u201d and that it will therefore focus detention efforts on those posing a public safety risk and \u201cdelay enforcement actions until after the crisis or utilize alternatives to detention, as appropriate\u201d (www.ice.gov/COVID19\n. opens in new tab\n). To promote \u201clifesaving\u201d activities, ICE should release low-flight-risk detainees who are in custody. According to ICE, protocols are in place to screen and isolate detainees with Covid-19 symptoms. But infections transmitted through droplets, like influenza and SARS-CoV-2, are particularly difficult to control in detention facilities, since 6-foot distancing and proper decontamination of surfaces are virtually impossible.\nICE facilities must adhere to Performance-Based National Detention Standards, which include access to medical care. However, most detained immigrants are housed in one of the more than 250 local detention facilities operating under intergovernmental services agreements or private facilities, which are not subject to these standards, and medical care in these settings is highly variable. Moreover, deaths from influenza have occurred in federal detention centers, highlighting lapses in care. Covid-19 will further strain a tenuous infrastructure. The logical solution is to reduce the number of people in detention as soon as possible.\nImmigrants are part of our national fabric. Undocumented immigrants make vital contributions to the economy. Many have low-wage essential jobs as home health aides and will be helping our vulnerable elders. Others are babysitters and are indispensable to many families in this crisis. Responding to the epidemic will require a unifying approach. It will be difficult to reverse years of anti-immigrant policies and rhetoric, but we believe it\u2019s essential that the administration address the needs of undocumented immigrants in its Covid-19 response.\nThey can start by expanding access to care. The Families First Coronavirus Response Act (FFCRA) passed on March 18 provides coverage for Covid-19 testing for the uninsured through National Disaster Medical System reimbursements. This is welcome news but does not go far enough. All care associated with patients with symptoms of Covid-19 should be covered, regardless of insurance status. Establishing multilingual Covid-19 hotlines through the 211 system with capability and clinical backup to triage calls from symptomatic people could help bridge the gap to care for those lacking a PCP.\nIn addition, suspending the public charge rule is imperative during this crisis. The FFCRA increases funding for SNAP and the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children in response to the economic impact of Covid-19. But given the public charge rule, immigrants may hesitate to obtain nutrition benefits for their children for fear of deportation or family separation. Furthermore, eligibility criteria for these benefits should be liberal to ensure that the most socioeconomically disadvantaged, including people without traditional proof-of-income documents, are not excluded.\nFinally, low-flight-risk immigrants should be released from detention. Facing the threat of Covid-19 in prisons, local jurisdictions have begun reducing inmate populations by identifying people detained for minor crimes or vulnerable to severe infection due to underlying conditions or age. A similar process can be applied to detention facilities.\nThese measures, together with an empathetic and inclusive message from the highest levels of leadership, will not reverse but may mitigate Covid-19\u2019s impact on undocumented immigrants and the health of the public at large.\nDisclosure forms provided by the authors are available at NEJM.org.\nThis article was published on March 27, 2020, at NEJM.org.\nAuthor Affiliations\nFrom Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine (K.R.P., M.V., S.P.), and the Department of Epidemiology, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health (C.B.) \u2014 both in Baltimore.\nSupplementary Material\nDisclosure Forms PDF 97KB\nReferences (5)", "10.1056/NEJMe2014793": "Audio Interview\nInterview with Dr. Eric Rubin and Dr. Lindsey Baden on Loosening Covid-19 Restrictions (22:37)\nDownload\nThe rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2, a novel coronavirus that emerged in late 2019, and the resulting Covid-19 disease has been labeled a Public Health Emergency of International Concern by the World Health Organization.

She was a delightful child who had the misfortune of presenting to the hospital at the beginning of the Covid-19 crisis with fevers, upper respiratory symptoms, and decreased neck range of motion. Part of her workup included an influenza swab, and she was placed on appropriate precautions until the results returned. As I walked in to see her, I noticed a sign on her door reading \u201cDroplet precautions,\u201d which meant I was required to wear a mask in order to evaluate the patient. Typically, a box of masks would be placed outside the patient\u2019s door, to facilitate access. Today, there was no box of masks. This omission, in and of itself, wasn\u2019t surprising: perhaps the last person to enter the room had used the last mask and threw away the box but forgot to replace it. I\u2019m sure that in my haste, I have been guilty of such infractions in the past. I briefly contemplated entering her room without a mask but thought better of it. I wouldn\u2019t want to catch the flu, I remember thinking.\nFour weeks later, I find myself in the middle of the Covid-19 pandemic. Health care in the United States has been flipped upside down. Surgical masks, N95 respirators, and powered air-purifying respirators are in perpetually short supply.1 Frontline providers are having to make excruciatingly difficult decisions regarding whom to treat with our limited supply of ventilators.2 The federal government is estimating that the number of deaths in the United States alone will be in the hundreds of thousands. Those of us who have found our role diminished as our elective cases have been canceled are being redeployed to the areas of the hospital with the greatest need.

SIGN UP\nAs a pediatric otolaryngologist, I am at particularly high risk for exposure. Many of my otolaryngology colleagues around the world have contracted Covid-19 while treating patients with the disease, and several of them have died. The viral particles are aerosolized during airway interventions, our specialty. Children tend to have a milder form of the disease, which means that it\u2019s reasonably likely that I have already been unknowingly exposed to a child with Covid-19. Am I an asymptomatic carrier of the disease \u2014 potentially spreading it to all the children at my hospital who were born with complex airway problems?\nTo preserve personal protective equipment and to protect ourselves and our patients, we as a specialty have canceled all elective surgeries. This decision has resulted in some interesting dilemmas, as we reconsider our definition of \u201curgent\u201d in this altered landscape. I was recently called to evaluate a 20-hour-old infant with Treacher\u2013Collins syndrome who was transported by air ambulance for an airway evaluation because he couldn\u2019t breathe when supine. \u201cI know he can\u2019t breathe well, but how bad are his apneas?\u201d I find myself asking, as I attempt to triage the critically ill.\nI try to explain to the primary medical team that we are limiting our in-person contact with our most vulnerable patients because perhaps the only thing worse for them than not seeing an airway specialist would be to have an anatomically complex airway and also have to fight off iatrogenic Covid-19. Ultimately, the air-lifted infant needed a tracheotomy, which we perform at 2 days of life. Some things you can\u2019t triage, I think, wondering whether the surgery would be safer for the child if we knew the Covid-19 status of the surgeons and other personnel involved in the procedure.\nEvery evening, when I finally finish my day, I change into brand new scrubs and shoes in an effort to shed any rogue viral particles that may have found a home on my clothing before I venture home. My beautifully oblivious 17-month-old daughter is unabashed in her desire to hug me as soon as I walk through the door \u2014 a desire only thwarted by my determination to make it to the shower before she has a chance to touch me. I achieve my goal every day only with an assist from my 34-week-pregnant wife, who has an equivalent desire not to let me infect the family.\nOne week into our coordinated Covid-19 prevention plan, the moment I have been dreading occurs. My daughter has a fever. Her symptoms are no different from those of most viral infections she has caught during her short life. My wife also starts to feel unwell \u2014 no fevers, but she is becoming short of breath. Both undergo testing for Covid-19. I am physically unaffected but mentally a mess. What does this mean for the pregnancy and our unborn child? Will I be separated from my wife for the birth? I am scared.\nI feel immense guilt at having burdened them with this horrible disease because of my career choices. As each of them starts to recover, however, I find myself hoping for what weeks ago would have seemed incomprehensible. I start to hope they both test positive for Covid-19. Clinicians around the world are finding themselves in situations where testing positive for Covid-19 is an inevitable consequence of the work they do. If my wife and daughter somehow managed to each beat the disease and develop immunity, my wife would develop Covid-19 antibodies that would be passed through her breast milk to our incoming newborn, providing immunity. I could then go back to the front line without my deepest fear \u2014 that of causing harm to my family \u2014 haunting my every patient interaction. Furthermore, maybe I could become an \u201cimmune provider\u201d: if I beat the disease myself, I could put myself at the front of the front line, completing the riskiest procedures in order to protect both patients and my colleagues.\nThe results come back. Negative. I am crushed.\nFor a moment, I saw a glimmer of hope illuminating the way out of this impossible situation. I thought, perhaps with naive optimism, I could return to the front line and my family would be protected. This previously preposterous shift in my own way of thinking echoes the chaos and rapid shifts in strategy that our country is making almost daily in our fight against this invisible beast.\nLike many clinicians, I am not quite sure what tomorrow will bring. For now, my tiny family and I go back to our own fight.

Covid-19 was recognized in December 2019.1 It was rapidly shown to be caused by a novel coronavirus that is structurally related to the virus that causes severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). As in two preceding instances of emergence of coronavirus disease in the past 18 years2 \u2014 SARS (2002 and 2003) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) (2012 to the present) \u2014 the Covid-19 outbreak has posed critical challenges for the public health, research, and medical communities.\nIn their Journal article, Li and colleagues3 provide a detailed clinical and epidemiologic description of the first 425 cases reported in the epicenter of the outbreak: the city of Wuhan in Hubei province, China. Although this information is critical in informing the appropriate response to this outbreak, as the authors point out, the study faces the limitation associated with reporting in real time the evolution of an emerging pathogen in its earliest stages. Nonetheless, a degree of clarity is emerging from this report. The median age of the patients was 59 years, with higher morbidity and mortality among the elderly and among those with coexisting conditions (similar to the situation with influenza); 56% of the patients were male. Of note, there were no cases in children younger than 15 years of age. Either children are less likely to become infected, which would have important epidemiologic implications, or their symptoms were so mild that their infection escaped detection, which has implications for the size of the denominator of total community infections.\nSign up for the Weekly Table of Contents email.\nEach week, receive an email with links to the articles published in the current week's issue of the New England Journal of Medicine. SIGN UP\nOn the basis of a case definition requiring a diagnosis of pneumonia, the currently reported case fatality rate is approximately 2%.4 In another article in the Journal, Guan et al.5 report mortality of 1.4% among 1099 patients with laboratory-confirmed Covid-19; these patients had a wide spectrum of disease severity. If one assumes that the number of asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic cases is several times as high as the number of reported cases, the case fatality rate may be considerably less than 1%. This suggests that the overall clinical consequences of Covid-19 may ultimately be more akin to those of a severe seasonal influenza (which has a case fatality rate of approximately 0.1%) or a pandemic influenza (similar to those in 1957 and 1968) rather than a disease similar to SARS or MERS, which have had case fatality rates of 9 to 10% and 36%, respectively.2\nThe efficiency of transmission for any respiratory virus has important implications for containment and mitigation strategies. The current study indicates an estimated basic reproduction number (R0) of 2.2, which means that, on average, each infected person spreads the infection to an additional two persons. As the authors note, until this number falls below 1.0, it is likely that the outbreak will continue to spread. Recent reports of high titers of virus in the oropharynx early in the course of disease arouse concern about increased infectivity during the period of minimal symptoms.6,7\nChina, the United States, and several other countries have instituted temporary restrictions on travel with an eye toward slowing the spread of this new disease within China and throughout the rest of the world. The United States has seen a dramatic reduction in the number of travelers from China, especially from Hubei province. At least on a temporary basis, such restrictions may have helped slow the spread of the virus: whereas 78,191 laboratory-confirmed cases had been identified in China as of February 26, 2020, a total of 2918 cases had been confirmed in 37 other countries or territories.4 As of February 26, 2020, there had been 14 cases detected in the United States involving travel to China or close contacts with travelers, 3 cases among U.S. citizens repatriated from China, and 42 cases among U.S. passengers repatriated from a cruise ship where the infection had spread.8 However, given the efficiency of transmission as indicated in the current report, we should be prepared for Covid-19 to gain a foothold throughout the world, including in the United States. Community spread in the United States could require a shift from containment to mitigation strategies such as social distancing in order to reduce transmission. Such strategies could include isolating ill persons (including voluntary isolation at home), school closures, and telecommuting where possible.9\nA robust research effort is currently under way to develop a vaccine against Covid-19.10 We anticipate that the first candidates will enter phase 1 trials by early spring. Therapy currently consists of supportive care while a variety of investigational approaches are being explored.11 Among these are the antiviral medication lopinavir\u2013ritonavir, interferon-1\u03b2, the RNA polymerase inhibitor remdesivir, chloroquine, and a variety of traditional Chinese medicine products.11 Once available, intravenous hyperimmune globulin from recovered persons and monoclonal antibodies may be attractive candidates to study in early intervention. Critical to moving the field forward, even in the context of an outbreak, is ensuring that investigational products are evaluated in scientifically and ethically sound studies.12\nEvery outbreak provides an opportunity to gain important information, some of which is associated with a limited window of opportunity. For example, Li et al. report a mean interval of 9.1 to 12.5 days between the onset of illness and hospitalization. This finding of a delay in the progression to serious disease may be telling us something important about the pathogenesis of this new virus and may provide a unique window of opportunity for intervention. Achieving a better understanding of the pathogenesis of this disease will be invaluable in navigating our responses in this uncharted arena. Furthermore, genomic studies could delineate host factors that predispose persons to acquisition of infection and disease progression.\nThe Covid-19 outbreak is a stark reminder of the ongoing challenge of emerging and reemerging infectious pathogens and the need for constant surveillance, prompt diagnosis, and robust research to understand the basic biology of new organisms and our susceptibilities to them, as well as to develop effective countermeasures.\nDisclosure forms provided by the authors are available with the full text of this editorial at NEJM.org.\nThis editorial was published on February 28, 2020, at NEJM.org.\nAuthor Affiliations\nFrom the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD (A.S.F., H.C.L.); and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta (R.R.R.).\nSupplementary Material\nDisclosure Forms PDF 146KB\nReferences (12)\nCiting Articles (62)", "10.1056/NEJMp2003539": "5 References\n65 Citing Articles\n4 Comments\nComments open through May 6, 2020\nAudio Interview\nInterview with Dr. Judd Hollander on how health systems can use telemedicine services during the Covid-19 pandemic.

SIGN UP\nA central strategy for health care surge control is \u201cforward triage\u201d \u2014 the sorting of patients before they arrive in the emergency department (ED). Direct-to-consumer (or on-demand) telemedicine, a 21st-century approach to forward triage that allows patients to be efficiently screened, is both patient-centered and conducive to self-quarantine, and it protects patients, clinicians, and the community from exposure. It can allow physicians and patients to communicate 24/7, using smartphones or webcam-enabled computers. Respiratory symptoms \u2014 which may be early signs of Covid-19 \u2014 are among the conditions most commonly evaluated with this approach. Health care providers can easily obtain detailed travel and exposure histories. Automated screening algorithms can be built into the intake process, and local epidemiologic information can be used to standardize screening and practice patterns across providers.\nMore than 50 U.S. health systems already have such programs. Jefferson Health, Mount Sinai, Kaiser Permanente, Cleveland Clinic, and Providence, for example, all leverage telehealth technology to allow clinicians to see patients who are at home. Systems lacking such programs can outsource similar services to physicians and support staff provided by Teladoc Health or American Well. At present, the major barrier to large-scale telemedical screening for SARS-CoV-2, the novel coronavirus causing Covid-19, is coordination of testing. As the availability of testing sites expands, local systems that can test appropriate patients while minimizing exposure \u2014 using dedicated office space, tents, or in-car testing \u2014 will need to be developed and integrated into telemedicine workflows.\nRather than expect all outpatient practices to keep up with rapidly evolving recommendations regarding Covid-19, health systems have developed automated logic flows (bots) that refer moderate-to-high-risk patients to nurse triage lines but are also permitting patients to schedule video visits with established or on-demand providers, to avoid travel to in-person care sites. Jefferson Health\u2019s telemedical systems have been successfully deployed to evaluate and treat patients without referring them to in-person care. When testing is needed, this approach requires centralized coordination with practice personnel as well as federal and local testing agencies. It is critical that practices not routinely refer patients to EDs, urgent care centers, or offices, which risks exposure of other patients and health care providers.\nPatients presenting for in-person care who screen positive for high-risk features should be isolated immediately to avert further contact with patients and health care workers. Before the Covid-19 outbreak, many EDs modified the \u201cprovider-in-triage model\u201d (rapid initial evaluation and testing) by allowing a remote provider to perform intake.3 Aurora Health, for example, partnered with a commercial telemedicine vendor, and others have developed their own software for this purpose. In an emergency situation, web-conferencing software with a secure open line from a triage room to a clinician can be implemented relatively rapidly. Covering multiple sites with a single remote clinician can address some workforce challenges, but it is difficult to do if your software lacks a queuing function.\nTablet computers can be cleaned between patients using well-defined infection-control procedures. In ambulatory care settings, patients screening positive at presentation can be given a tablet and isolated in an exam room. A telehealth visit can be conducted without exposing staff by using commercial systems or paired tablets allowing communication with a clinician through a dedicated connection. Because of supply-chain challenges, we rapidly repurposed and deployed tablets we already had. We expect that Covid-19 testing will be more widely available shortly, but initially patients who were well enough to be sent home were quarantined there while home-based testing was coordinated. This system works for patients who are well but cannot totally eliminate health care workers\u2019 exposure to sick patients who require procedures. Similar televisit systems are also being used for hospitalized patients to reduce exposure risks for visitors and staff.\nElectronic intensive care unit (e-ICU) monitoring programs, which allow nurses and physicians to remotely monitor the status of 60 to 100 patients in ICUs in multiple hospitals \u2014 such as services offered by Mercy Virtual Care Center, Sutter Health, and Sentara Healthcare \u2014 are ideal for monitoring sicker patients. Technological and staffing complexities make it impossible to create such a program on short notice, but rapid deployment of the two-tablet approach can reduce health care workers\u2019 contact with infected patients in the ICU.\nCommunity paramedicine or mobile integrated health care programs allow patients to be treated in their homes, with higher-level medical support provided virtually. Houston\u2019s Project ETHAN (Emergency Telehealth and Navigation) has used telemedical oversight by physicians to augment care offered in person by 911 responders, reducing the need for transportation to the ED.4 In the face of Covid-19, Avera Health is preparing to send mobile home health care units directly to patients and is coordinating home-based testing. For sicker patients at home, such programs can facilitate evaluation before hospital transfer, potentially allowing them to bypass the ED and be placed directly in a hospital bed, reducing exposure for health care workers and other patients.\nMuch medical decision making is cognitive, and telemedicine can provide rapid access to subspecialists who aren\u2019t immediately available in person. This approach has been explored most fully in the context of stroke, for which systems such as Jefferson Health, Cleveland Clinic, and the University of Pittsburgh provide virtual emergency neurologic care at large numbers of hospitals. The Mount Sinai system leverages specialists at eight hospitals and more than 300 sites to provide virtual emergency consultations and distribute work among subspecialty providers. The barriers to implementing these programs are largely related to payment, credentialing, and staffing of specialists.\nReports that as many as 100 health care workers at a single institution have to be quarantined at home because of exposure to Covid-19 have raised concern about workforce capacity. At institutions with ED tele-intake or direct-to-consumer care, quarantined physicians can cover those services, freeing up other physicians to perform in-person care. Office-based practices can also employ quarantined physicians to care for patients remotely. The challenge is that other health professionals (nurses, medical assistants, physician assistants) also contribute to in-person care, and telemedicine cannot replace them all.\nTo prepare for the worst-case scenario \u2014 a local pandemic that leaves health care workers quarantined, sick, or absent \u2014 Jefferson Health is deploying telehealth so that clinicians can continue to care for established (nonexposed) patients by converting scheduled office visits to telemedicine visits. These visits can be conducted with both patient and clinician at home, greatly limiting travel and exposure and permitting uninterrupted care of established patients. Online training modules and remote training sessions are available for clinicians or patients who require just-in-time training or assistance during their first call.\nThe main barriers to maintaining usual care by telemedicine require changes that are unlikely to come from the federal level. Commercial reimbursement, Medicaid reimbursement, and credentialing are the states\u2019 domain. Only 20% of states require payment parity between telemedicine and in-person services.5 Fortunately, both the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and some local commercial payers have modified payment policy in response to Covid-19. We hope others will follow suit.\nDisasters and pandemics pose unique challenges to health care delivery. Though telehealth will not solve them all, it\u2019s well suited for scenarios in which infrastructure remains intact and clinicians are available to see patients. Payment and regulatory structures, state licensing, credentialing across hospitals, and program implementation all take time to work through, but health systems that have already invested in telemedicine are well positioned to ensure that patients with Covid-19 receive the care they need. In this instance, it may be a virtually perfect solution.\nDisclosure forms provided by the authors are available at NEJM.org.\nThis article was published on March 11, 2020, at NEJM.org.\nAuthor Affiliations\nFrom Sidney Kimmel Medical College of Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia (J.E.H.); and Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York (B.G.C.).\nSupplementary Material\nDisclosure Forms PDF 97KB\nReferences (5)\nCiting Articles (65)\nComments (4)", "10.1056/NEJMp2006607": "2 References\n1 Citing Article\nI met him on March 3, 2020, a 70-year-old man with a 6-month history of classic stable angina. He had left-arm achiness whenever he walked uphill, reliably triggered by the same level of exertion and always relieved with rest. A stress test showed a large, reversible inferolateral defect, prompting consultation with me. At the time of his visit, travel restrictions had been issued for China, Iran, Italy, and South Korea, and the first Covid-19\u2013related death had been reported in the United States. But on that day, in my office on Wilshire Boulevard in Los Angeles, Covid-19 wasn\u2019t even a blip on our radar.\nRather than ordering a knee-jerk coronary angiogram, I explained to the patient the 2014 Focused Update of the Guideline for the Diagnosis and Management of Patients with Stable Ischemic Heart Disease,1 which recommends coronary angiography only in patients with presumed stable ischemic heart disease with unacceptable ischemic symptoms despite medical therapy. He was the perfect candidate for medical therapy, because when we first met he was receiving none.\nSign up for the Weekly Table of Contents email.\nEach week, receive an email with links to the articles published in the current week's issue of the New England Journal of Medicine. SIGN UP\nEven better, the results of the ISCHEMIA (International Study of Comparative Health Effectiveness with Medical and Invasive Approaches) trial had been presented a few months before his visit.2 This landmark trial compared optimal medical therapy or optimal medical therapy plus routine cardiac catheterization with revascularization in patients with stable angina. Its conclusion was a validation of the 2014 guidelines: an invasive approach did not reduce the risk of myocardial infarction or cardiovascular death. The results were also satisfying from a pathophysiological standpoint: a focal stenosis is the marker of the systemic disease of atherosclerosis, so it made more medical sense to treat the disease with medications rather than just fix the stenosis with a stent.\nOn November 16, 2019, the presentation of the ISCHEMIA trial was met with great fanfare at the American Heart Association Scientific Sessions. Internet medical pundits debated the finer points: Did the secondary end points actually favor intervention? Were the end points adjudicated fairly? And why were the results not simultaneously published in a high-impact journal? In retrospect, those passionate discussions seem quaint; just a day later, the yet-to-be-named SARS-CoV-2 infected the first patient in Hubei Province, China.\nBut on March 3, 2020, when faced with a patient who perfectly fit the profile of an ISCHEMIA trial enrollee, I delighted in the opportunity to provide guideline- and evidence-based therapy that made pathophysiological sense, though the patient was suspicious, and his wife more so. Still, they listened politely as I explained the pathophysiology of atherosclerosis. They even smiled when I described the limitations of the \u201coculostenotic reflex,\u201d an interventional cardiologist\u2019s shorthand for the see-a-blockage\u2013fix-a-blockage approach to coronary artery disease. The man agreed to start taking an aspirin, a beta-blocker, and a statin, though his wife made this plan contingent on an angiogram scheduled a few weeks later.\nI acquiesced to the angiogram because I knew that risk\u2013benefit calculations are not just for physicians; patients perform them, too. I worried about the complications of potentially unnecessary angiography that would not improve survival and might not be necessary to improve quality of life, if medical therapy worked its magic. The patient and his wife worried about a ticking time bomb in his chest. I knew it was barely ticking, but I also knew they were not entirely convinced that the fuse was long, measured in years, not weeks.\nHe scheduled a follow-up visit on March 18, 2020. By then, the World Health Organization had declared Covid-19 a pandemic, and my medical center was urging all physicians to change all nonessential office visits to telephone encounters. I had to decide: Was this follow-up visit essential? My first response: of course. Partly, it was instinct: How could looking into his eyes and auscultating his heart be anything but essential? Partly, it was inertia: I was accustomed to face-to-face visits; why try something new? But I set aside my reservations in the name of social distancing.\nThe patient, his wife, and I met over the phone, and despite my reluctance, it went well. I suspect Sir William Osler would not have been surprised. A patient with angina might have inspired Osler\u2019s aphorism \u201cListen to your patient; he is telling you the diagnosis,\u201d since angina can be diagnosed only by a careful history.\nThe patient reported that after 2 weeks of medical therapy, the discomfort was somewhat reduced; he still had aching in his left arm when he walked uphill, but could walk farther before needing to stop. And this time, his wife surprised me. Instead of asking whether we could move up the angiogram she had bargained for, she suggested we delay it and augment medical therapy instead. Had my explanation of atherosclerosis sunk in? Probably not; Covid-19 made them do it.\nPre\u2013Covid-19, the patient and his wife had weighed the risks of an angiogram, including death, myocardial infarction, and stroke, as minor compared with the peace of mind that would come from treating the ticking time bomb in his chest. Post\u2013Covid-19, they added the fear of the unknown, a potentially fatal respiratory infection, to the calculus. Suddenly, the benefits of medical therapy seemed greater; the ticking time bomb was Covid-19.\nA few months ago, I would never have predicted that the National Basketball Association would suspend all games and Major League Baseball would cancel spring training. I would have rolled my eyes at the thought of restaurants, parks, and my kids\u2019 school closing indefinitely. I would never have believed that our routine Saturday-morning shopping excursions would require forays into three supermarkets to scavenge the essentials to sustain a family of five for a week. And I would never have predicted that a respiratory virus would generate more fear than coronary artery disease.\nWhat will the next few months bring? My patient, his wife, and I will talk every week. If his symptoms don\u2019t improve, I\u2019ll augment medical therapy. If his symptoms worsen, I\u2019ll schedule angiography, hoping that my hospital still has the capacity to perform it when the time comes.\nFor physicians and patients alike, Covid-19 has clouded every aspect of our lives with uncertainty, and the consequences of our suppressed panic and anticipatory dread are impossible to predict. This patient was affected by Covid-19, not by means of a viral pathogen in his respiratory tract, but by means of fear of that pathogen. I am grateful that the invisible hand of Covid-19 inadvertently steered him away from a procedure he didn\u2019t need. But I worry that other patients may not be so lucky. Will fear of Covid-19 prevent them from presenting for medical attention when they need it?\nOverwhelmed by the anticipated harms of Covid-19, we must remember that other diseases will continue to progress during the pandemic. With all our patients, we will have to ask ourselves a new question: What is the best approach to treating their disease, and how does our fear of Covid-19 affect our shared risk\u2013benefit calculus? As we embrace new ways of communicating with patients, we must listen to not only their symptoms, but also to their fears. We must do our best to chart a course in the face of uncertainty, because other diseases will not take a hiatus as the pandemic spreads exponentially around us.\nDisclosure forms provided by the author are available at NEJM.org.\nThis article was published on April 2, 2020, at NEJM.org.\nAuthor Affiliations\nFrom the Department of Cardiology, Smidt Heart Institute, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles.\nSupplementary Material\nDisclosure Forms PDF 48KB\nReferences (2)\nCiting Article (1)", "10.1056/NEJMp2000821": "5 References\nThe Covid-19 pandemic has brought into sharp focus the need for health care reforms that promote universal access to affordable care. Although all aspects of U.S. health care will face incredible challenges in the coming months, the patchwork way we govern and pay for health care is unraveling in this time of crisis, leaving millions of people vulnerable and requiring swift, coordinated political action to ensure access to affordable care.\nAbout half of Americans receive health coverage through their employer, and with record numbers filing for unemployment insurance, millions find themselves without health insurance in the midst of the largest pandemic in a century. Even those who maintain insurance coverage may find care unaffordable.\nSign up for the Weekly Table of Contents email.\nEach week, receive an email with links to the articles published in the current week's issue of the New England Journal of Medicine. SIGN UP\nBefore the pandemic, research showed that more than half of Americans with employer-sponsored health insurance had delayed or postponed recommended treatment for themselves or a family member in the previous year because of cost.1 The loss of jobs, income, and health insurance associated with the pandemic will greatly exacerbate existing health care cost challenges for all Americans. For instance, in a recent poll, 68% of adults said the out-of-pocket costs they might have to pay would be very or somewhat important to their decision to seek care if they had symptoms of Covid-19.2 Failure to receive testing and treatment because of cost harms everyone by prolonging the pandemic, increasing its morbidity and mortality, and exacerbating its economic impact.\nTo address myriad issues raised by Covid-19, Congress has passed two significant pieces of legislation, with more likely to come. The Families First Coronavirus Response Act (FFCRA) requires all private insurers, Medicare, Medicare Advantage, and Medicaid to cover Covid-19 testing and eliminate all cost sharing (copayments, deductibles, and coinsurance payments) associated with testing services during the public health emergency. It also appropriated $1 billion for the Public Health and Social Services Emergency Fund to cover testing for uninsured individuals under state Medicaid plans. Although the FFCRA assists with testing costs, patients remain vulnerable to cost-sharing expenses associated with treatment (such as hospitalization) until they reach their yearly out-of-pocket maximum, which can exceed $8,000 for an individual and $16,000 for a family.\nThe Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act, a $2.2 trillion pandemic-relief bill, requires all private plans to cover Covid-19 testing and future vaccines, but it stops short of eliminating cost sharing for Covid-19 treatment. Nonetheless, many private insurers, including Humana, Cigna, UnitedHealth Group, and Blue Cross Blue Shield, have agreed to waive cost-sharing payments for plan members treated for Covid-19. The CARES Act appropriated $100 billion for hospitals and health care providers, which Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar later conditioned on providers\u2019 agreement not to bill insured patients more than their in-network cost-sharing amounts and not to bill uninsured patients at all for Covid-19 treatment. The federal government will reimburse providers at Medicare rates for treating uninsured patients. The CARES Act also provided substantial tax credits, emergency grants, and loans to help businesses keep employees on the payroll or on furlough through June 2020, while extending and increasing unemployment benefits for those who lost their jobs.\nThough these laws provide critical assistance, additional policies are needed to ensure that Americans can continue to access affordable care as the crisis continues. First, I believe policymakers should freeze people\u2019s insurance status as of April 1, 2020, to keep as many people as possible in their existing plans and with their current providers. People who had employer-sponsored insurance or an Affordable Care Act (ACA) marketplace plan as of that date should be able to remain on that plan through the end of the public health emergency, even if they lose their jobs or cannot pay their premiums. As an initial step in this direction, several states have instituted grace periods on insurance-premium payments for all policies.3 For example, the Ohio Department of Insurance ordered all insurers to offer employers a 60-day grace period for premium payments, enabling them to retain employees and their health benefits for an extended period.4 Premium payments could be paused, subsidized, or paid directly by federal disaster-relief funds.\nSecond, policymakers should secure coverage for people who have already lost their jobs by expanding access to ACA marketplace plans and Medicaid. Eleven states and the District of Columbia have opened new open enrollment periods for their state ACA marketplaces to encourage enrollment.3 Despite President Donald Trump\u2019s announcement that he would not open enrollment in the 38 states with ACA plans hosted on the federal marketplace, people who have lost their jobs within the past 60 days or who expect to lose their job in the next 60 days can apply to enroll in an ACA marketplace plan during a special enrollment period (just as one can after a life event such as marriage or the birth of a child).\nIn response to the pandemic, nearly all states have received Section 1135 Medicaid waivers to meet the needs of their most vulnerable residents.3 Many states sought such waivers to eliminate Covid-19\u2013related cost sharing, facilitate provider and participant enrollment, and waive preauthorization requirements for Covid-19\u2013related services during the declared public health emergency. In addition, many states (including Iowa, which already applied for and received a Medicaid waiver to be allowed to maintain its enrollment) will pause disenrollment to receive a higher federal matching rate established by the FFCRA. Finally, no state is currently enforcing work requirements for maintaining Medicaid eligibility.\nGiven the size and scope of the pandemic, state or federal government officials could also implement something similar to the Disaster Relief Medicaid program (DRM), a temporary public health insurance program created in New York after the 9/11 terrorist attacks.5 The DRM allowed nearly 350,000 New Yorkers to quickly and easily obtain access to Medicaid benefits by raising eligibility thresholds, excluding asset tests, and using short-form applications. The program provided New Yorkers with 4 months of emergency Medicaid coverage during the most critical time of the crisis, and then helped them transition to other coverage. A similar emergency program could raise eligibility thresholds beyond Medicaid expansion levels and increase federal matching funds to help cover people who lost their jobs or remain uninsured during the pandemic.\nThird, state and federal officials should continue addressing out-of-pocket expenses, such as cost sharing and surprise medical billing. Lawmakers can follow Massachusetts, New Mexico, and Washington, D.C., by eliminating cost sharing for Covid-19\u2013related treatment. Hospital and provider reimbursement shortages can be covered by CARES Act appropriations.\nCovid-19 also creates unique affordability challenges related to surprise medical billing, which can occur when a patient receives treatment from an out-of-network physician at an in-network facility. Staffing shortages and triage protocols make it more likely that patients will be sent to out-of-network facilities or be seen by out-of-network providers when they cannot check providers\u2019 network status. Furthermore, provider shortages may require providers to fill in care gaps for many conditions, not just Covid-19, expanding the potential for out-of-network care and surprise bills during this time. Though more than half the states offer some surprise-billing protections, policymakers should eliminate bills from out-of-network providers that exceed in-network cost-sharing limits for any medical treatment received during the public health emergency.\nWhile states should continue leading the way on Covid-19 policies, comprehensive protections demand federal intervention. The Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) prohibits state laws governing health insurance from applying to self-insured employer plans, typically offered by large employers such as Apple, Intuit, and Microsoft. As a result, current state surprise-billing protections, cost-sharing prohibitions, and coverage mandates will not apply to nearly 60% of Americans with employer-sponsored health insurance (nearly 30% of the population). ERISA thus leaves millions of people unprotected by state health care reforms. Absent a federal response, states can avoid some ERISA entanglements by directly prohibiting providers from charging cost-sharing rates for Covid-19 treatment and from surprise billing, but historically this approach has been politically infeasible. Perhaps Covid-19 provides the necessary impetus for change.\nNever before has the interdependence of all our health, finances, and social fabric been so starkly visible. Never before has the need for health care reforms that ensure universal access to affordable care for all Americans been more apparent. Our policies on health and health care, both during this pandemic and in the future, should reflect this reality, and we should not let the lessons of this crisis pass us by.\nDisclosure forms provided by the author are available at NEJM.org.\nThis article was published on April 17, 2020, at NEJM.org.\nAuthor Affiliations\nFrom the University of California Hastings College of the Law, San Francisco.\nSupplementary Material\nDisclosure Forms PDF 143KB\nReferences (5)", "10.1056/NEJMp2003762": "5 References\n26 Citing Articles\nIn any crisis, leaders have two equally important responsibilities: solve the immediate problem and keep it from happening again. The Covid-19 pandemic is a case in point. We need to save lives now while also improving the way we respond to outbreaks in general. The first point is more pressing, but the second has crucial long-term consequences.\nThe long-term challenge \u2014 improving our ability to respond to outbreaks \u2014 isn\u2019t new. Global health experts have been saying for years that another pandemic whose speed and severity rivaled those of the 1918 influenza epidemic was a matter not of if but of when.1 The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation has committed substantial resources in recent years to helping the world prepare for such a scenario.\nSign up for the Weekly Table of Contents email.\nEach week, receive an email with links to the articles published in the current week's issue of the New England Journal of Medicine. SIGN UP\nNow we also face an immediate crisis. In the past week, Covid-19 has started behaving a lot like the once-in-a-century pathogen we\u2019ve been worried about. I hope it\u2019s not that bad, but we should assume it will be until we know otherwise.\nThere are two reasons that Covid-19 is such a threat. First, it can kill healthy adults in addition to elderly people with existing health problems. The data so far suggest that the virus has a case fatality risk around 1%; this rate would make it many times more severe than typical seasonal influenza, putting it somewhere between the 1957 influenza pandemic (0.6%) and the 1918 influenza pandemic (2%).2\nSecond, Covid-19 is transmitted quite efficiently. The average infected person spreads the disease to two or three others \u2014 an exponential rate of increase. There is also strong evidence that it can be transmitted by people who are just mildly ill or even presymptomatic.3 That means Covid-19 will be much harder to contain than the Middle East respiratory syndrome or severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), which were spread much less efficiently and only by symptomatic people. In fact, Covid-19 has already caused 10 times as many cases as SARS in a quarter of the time.\nNational, state, and local governments and public health agencies can take steps over the next few weeks to slow the virus\u2019s spread. For example, in addition to helping their own citizens respond, donor governments can help low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) prepare for this pandemic.4 Many LMIC health systems are already stretched thin, and a pathogen like the coronavirus can quickly overwhelm them. And poorer countries have little political or economic leverage, given wealthier countries\u2019 natural desire to put their own people first.\nBy helping African and South Asian countries get ready now, we can save lives and slow the global circulation of the virus. (A substantial portion of the commitment Melinda and I recently made to help kickstart the global response to Covid-19 \u2014 which could total up to $100 million \u2014 is focused on LMICs.)\nThe world also needs to accelerate work on treatments and vaccines for Covid-19.5 Scientists sequenced the genome of the virus and developed several promising vaccine candidates in a matter of days, and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations is already preparing up to eight promising vaccine candidates for clinical trials. If some of these vaccines prove safe and effective in animal models, they could be ready for larger-scale trials as early as June. Drug discovery can also be accelerated by drawing on libraries of compounds that have already been tested for safety and by applying new screening techniques, including machine learning, to identify antivirals that could be ready for large-scale clinical trials within weeks.\nAll these steps would help address the current crisis. But we also need to make larger systemic changes so we can respond more efficiently and effectively when the next epidemic arrives.\nIt\u2019s essential to help LMICs strengthen their primary health care systems. When you build a health clinic, you\u2019re also creating part of the infrastructure for fighting epidemics. Trained health care workers not only deliver vaccines; they can also monitor disease patterns, serving as part of the early warning systems that alert the world to potential outbreaks.\nWe also need to invest in disease surveillance, including a case database that is instantly accessible to relevant organizations, and rules requiring countries to share information. Governments should have access to lists of trained personnel, from local leaders to global experts, who are prepared to deal with an epidemic immediately, as well as lists of supplies to be stockpiled or redirected in an emergency.\nIn addition, we need to build a system that can develop safe, effective vaccines and antivirals, get them approved, and deliver billions of doses within a few months after the discovery of a fast-moving pathogen. That\u2019s a tough challenge that presents technical, diplomatic, and budgetary obstacles, as well as demanding partnership between the public and private sectors. But all these obstacles can be overcome.\nOne of the main technical challenges for vaccines is to improve on the old ways of manufacturing proteins, which are too slow for responding to an epidemic. We need to develop platforms that are predictably safe, so regulatory reviews can happen quickly, and that make it easy for manufacturers to produce doses at low cost on a massive scale. For antivirals, we need an organized system to screen existing treatments and candidate molecules in a swift and standardized manner.\nAnother technical challenge involves constructs based on nucleic acids. These constructs can be produced within hours after a virus\u2019s genome has been sequenced; now we need to find ways to produce them at scale.\nBeyond these technical solutions, we\u2019ll need diplomatic efforts to drive international collaboration and data sharing. Developing antivirals and vaccines involves massive clinical trials and licensing agreements that would cross national borders. We should make the most of global forums that can help achieve consensus on research priorities and trial protocols so that promising vaccine and antiviral candidates can move quickly through this process. These platforms include the World Health Organization R&D Blueprint, the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium trial network, and the Global Research Collaboration for Infectious Disease Preparedness. The goal of this work should be to get conclusive clinical trial results and regulatory approval in 3 months or less, without compromising patients\u2019 safety.\nThen there\u2019s the question of funding. Budgets for these efforts need to be expanded several times over. Billions more dollars are needed to complete phase 3 trials and secure regulatory approval for coronavirus vaccines, and still more funding will be needed to improve disease surveillance and response.\nGovernment funding is needed because pandemic products are extraordinarily high-risk investments; public funding will minimize risk for pharmaceutical companies and get them to jump in with both feet. In addition, governments and other donors will need to fund \u2014 as a global public good \u2014 manufacturing facilities that can generate a vaccine supply in a matter of weeks. These facilities can make vaccines for routine immunization programs in normal times and be quickly refitted for production during a pandemic. Finally, governments will need to finance the procurement and distribution of vaccines to the populations that need them.\nBillions of dollars for antipandemic efforts is a lot of money. But that\u2019s the scale of investment required to solve the problem. And given the economic pain that an epidemic can impose \u2014 we\u2019re already seeing how Covid-19 can disrupt supply chains and stock markets, not to mention people\u2019s lives \u2014 it will be a bargain.\nFinally, governments and industry will need to come to an agreement: during a pandemic, vaccines and antivirals can\u2019t simply be sold to the highest bidder. They should be available and affordable for people who are at the heart of the outbreak and in greatest need. Not only is such distribution the right thing to do, it\u2019s also the right strategy for short-circuiting transmission and preventing future pandemics.\nThese are the actions that leaders should be taking now. There is no time to waste.\nDisclosure forms provided by the author are available at NEJM.org.\nThis article was published on February 28, 2020, at NEJM.org.\nAuthor Affiliations\nFrom the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, Seattle.\nSupplementary Material\nDisclosure Forms PDF 149KB\nReferences (5)\nCiting Articles (26)", "10.1056/NEJMp2006141": "5 References\n18 Citing Articles\nOn March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization designated \u201ccoronavirus disease 2019\u201d (Covid-19) a global pandemic. As the number of cases in the United States continues to grow, political leaders are encouraging physical (or \u201csocial\u201d) distancing to slow the rate of transmission. The goal of this practice is to flatten the curve of new infection, thereby avoiding a surge of demand on the health care system, but the effects of physical distancing may take weeks to appear. U.S. hospitals are already reporting shortages of key equipment needed to care for critically ill patients, including ventilators and personal protective equipment (PPE) for medical staff. Adequate production and distribution of both types of equipment are crucial to caring for patients during the pandemic.\nThere is a broad range of estimates of the number of ventilators we will need to care for U.S. patients with Covid-19, from several hundred thousand to as many as a million.1 The estimates vary depending on the number, speed, and severity of infections, of course, but even the availability of testing affects the number of ventilators needed: without adequate testing, the number increases because patients who are traditionally treated with noninvasive positive-pressure ventilation (NIPPV) for conditions such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbations may need to instead be presumptively intubated while awaiting Covid-19 testing results (using NIPPV is contraindicated for patients with Covid-19 because of aerosolization of the virus under positive pressure). Current estimates of the number of ventilators in the United States range from 60,000 to 160,000, depending on whether those that have only partial functionality are included.2 The national strategic reserve of ventilators is small and far from sufficient for the projected gap.2 No matter which estimate we use, there are not enough ventilators for patients with Covid-19 in the upcoming months.\nSign up for the Weekly Table of Contents email.\nEach week, receive an email with links to the articles published in the current week's issue of the New England Journal of Medicine. SIGN UP\nEqually worrisome is the lack of adequate PPE for frontline health care workers, including respirators, gloves, face shields, gowns, and hand sanitizer. In Italy, health care workers experienced high rates of infection and death3 partly because of inadequate access to PPE. And recent estimates here in the United States suggest that we will need far more respirators and surgical masks than are currently available.4\nThe U.S. shortage has multiple causes, including problems with the global supply chain. Before this pandemic, for instance, China produced approximately half the world\u2019s face masks.5 As the infection spread across China, their exports came to a halt. Now, as the infection spreads globally and transmission in China slows, China is shipping masks to other countries as part of goodwill packages. The United States has not been a major recipient.5\nThe shortages have led to pleas from individual U.S. health care providers trying to secure adequate supplies of PPE. The situation has become so dire that some providers are using social media (with tags like #GetMePPE) and have even set up websites to obtain PPE directly. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that during crisis situations, N95 respirator masks be used only during aerosol-generating procedures, but that means risking exposure of health care workers using less protective surgical masks around patients with confirmed or suspected Covid-19 infection. Additional guidelines from the CDC include reusing masks and respirators intended for one-time use and, if stocks are fully depleted, using scarves or bandanas. The evidence to support these recommendations is thin.\nWhat can we do to close the gap between the need and the availability of ventilators and PPE? We need a multipronged strategy. First, the Defense Production Act (DPA) allows the President to direct private companies to produce equipment needed for a national emergency. The President should use this power to begin to close the gap. But simply demanding more ventilators won\u2019t be enough \u2014 there are only a few companies that have the expertise to make these devices. The federal government should not only direct these companies to maximize production, but should also order their suppliers and others to maximize the availability of raw materials. Finally, the federal government needs to bring other industries into this effort. Automakers, for instance, have said they might have the capacity to make ventilators. It would be helpful to engage them to see whether and how quickly they can contribute to boosting ventilator supply.\nFor PPE, the solutions are somewhat different. While the DPA is important for directing private-sector companies to make more PPE, there are additional options as well. U.S. factories, for instance, already produce millions of N95 respirators each month, but most of these are produced under standards not approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The government recently lifted the FDA standards, stating that N95s approved by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health could be used by health care workers. Nevertheless, few state health departments or hospital systems have been able to procure this PPE.\nState governments could encourage companies in their communities that might be able to shift production to making this equipment to do so. The elements of PPE are complicated but don\u2019t require the intensive capital that ventilator manufacture demands, so smaller regional companies can play a key role in filling the gap. State partnerships with these companies will take ingenuity, meaningful resources, and a relaxation of less essential regulatory requirements.\nAnother role for government and the health care system must be to reduce hoarding of PPE and to tap into already existing stockpiles. Masks and gloves are used in many nonmedical settings \u2014 construction companies, laboratories, artists, and even the sets of some television shows have stores of these items. Though there has already been a grassroots effort to donate this PPE to health care workers, a coordinated effort by local governments to collect these supplies would be helpful.\nBeyond increasing the supply, a crucial role for the government is to coordinate efforts to ensure that the areas hardest hit at any given time are receiving needed equipment. Individual state governments and health care systems are currently competing for resources, and those resources are not necessarily being distributed on the basis of need. Surges of Covid-19 cases are unlikely to happen in all parts of the country at once, so there is an opportunity to coordinate the filling of gaps. As New York City, for instance, sees a surge of Covid-19 cases, other communities with few cases could share their supplies; New York could then pass equipment on when its surge subsides. Although such sharing can happen informally, some degree of federal coordination would be helpful from government agencies such as the CDC or the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. Partnering with technology companies to track the availability of and projected needs for equipment in real time, ensuring that there is a close match between supply and demand, would also be helpful. Ultimately, this type of coordination could also help in identifying other anticipated supply-chain issues, such as threats to access to pharmaceuticals. A coordinated, nationwide response is not something that individual states have the resources or legal authority to accomplish; thus, the federal government, in partnership with technology companies, could play a critical role.\nAs the United States braces for a growing wave of patients with Covid-19 in our hospitals and ICUs, we must ensure that we have the key equipment needed to care for patients and to keep our health care workforce safe. Achieving this goal will require a concerted approach from all sectors, from local and national government to the private sector and health care providers themselves. Failure to act in a coordinated manner would keep many patients from getting the care they need and would lead to the situation we see in Italy, in which frontline clinicians are making difficult decisions about who will and who won\u2019t receive care. Furthermore, without adequate PPE, health care workers will get sick, endangering the functioning of the entire health care system. The human and economic costs of that scenario should not be underestimated.\nDisclosure forms provided by the authors are available at NEJM.org.\nThis article was published on March 25, 2020, at NEJM.org.\nAuthor Affiliations\nFrom Alpert Medical School, Brown University, Providence, RI (M.L.R.); Oregon Health and Science University, Portland (V.G.); and the Harvard Global Health Institute, Cambridge, MA (A.K.J.).\nSupplementary Material\nDisclosure Forms PDF 93KB\nReferences (5)\nCiting Articles (18)", "10.1056/NEJMe2009758": "10 References\nTraditional infection-control and public health strategies rely heavily on early detection of disease to contain spread. When Covid-19 burst onto the global scene, public health officials initially deployed interventions that were used to control severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003, including symptom-based case detection and subsequent testing to guide isolation and quarantine. This initial approach was justified by the many similarities between SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2, including high genetic relatedness, transmission primarily through respiratory droplets, and the frequency of lower respiratory symptoms (fever, cough, and shortness of breath) with both infections developing a median of 5 days after exposure. However, despite the deployment of similar control interventions, the trajectories of the two epidemics have veered in dramatically different directions. Within 8 months, SARS was controlled after SARS-CoV-1 had infected approximately 8100 persons in limited geographic areas. Within 5 months, SARS-CoV-2 has infected more than 2.6 million people and continues to spread rapidly around the world.\nWhat explains these differences in transmission and spread? A key factor in the transmissibility of Covid-19 is the high level of SARS-CoV-2 shedding in the upper respiratory tract,1 even among presymptomatic patients, which distinguishes it from SARS-CoV-1, where replication occurs mainly in the lower respiratory tract.2 Viral loads with SARS-CoV-1, which are associated with symptom onset, peak a median of 5 days later than viral loads with SARS-CoV-2, which makes symptom-based detection of infection more effective in the case of SARS CoV-1.3 With influenza, persons with asymptomatic disease generally have lower quantitative viral loads in secretions from the upper respiratory tract than from the lower respiratory tract and a shorter duration of viral shedding than persons with symptoms,4 which decreases the risk of transmission from paucisymptomatic persons (i.e., those with few symptoms).\nSign up for the Weekly Table of Contents email.\nEach week, receive an email with links to the articles published in the current week's issue of the New England Journal of Medicine. SIGN UP\nArons et al. now report in the Journal an outbreak of Covid-19 in a skilled nursing facility in Washington State where a health care provider who was working while symptomatic tested positive for infection with SARS-CoV-2 on March 1, 2020.5 Residents of the facility were then offered two facility-wide point-prevalence screenings for SARS-CoV-2 by real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) of nasopharyngeal swabs on March 13 and March 19\u201320, along with collection of information on symptoms the residents recalled having had over the preceding 14 days. Symptoms were classified into typical (fever, cough, and shortness of breath), atypical, and none. Among 76 residents in the point-prevalence surveys, 48 (63%) had positive rRT-PCR results, with 27 (56%) essentially asymptomatic, although symptoms subsequently developed in 24 of these residents (within a median of 4 days) and they were reclassified as presymptomatic. Quantitative SARS-CoV-2 viral loads were similarly high in the four symptom groups (residents with typical symptoms, those with atypical symptoms, those who were presymptomatic, and those who remained asymptomatic). It is notable that 17 of 24 specimens (71%) from presymptomatic persons had viable virus by culture 1 to 6 days before the development of symptoms. Finally, the mortality from Covid-19 in this facility was high; of 57 residents who tested positive, 15 (26%) died.\nAn important finding of this report is that more than half the residents of this skilled nursing facility (27 of 48) who had positive tests were asymptomatic at testing. Moreover, live coronavirus clearly sheds at high concentrations from the nasal cavity even before symptom development. Although the investigators were not able to retrospectively elucidate specific person-to-person transmission events and although symptom ascertainment may be unreliable in a group in which more than half the residents had cognitive impairment, these results indicate that asymptomatic persons are playing a major role in the transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Symptom-based screening alone failed to detect a high proportion of infectious cases and was not enough to control transmission in this setting. The high mortality (>25%) argues that we need to change our current approach for skilled nursing facilities in order to protect vulnerable, enclosed populations until other preventive measures, such as a vaccine or chemoprophylaxis, are available.\nA new approach that expands Covid-19 testing to include asymptomatic persons residing or working in skilled nursing facilities needs to be implemented now. Despite \u201clockdowns\u201d in these facilities, coronavirus outbreaks continue to spread, with 1 in 10 nursing homes in the United States (>1300 skilled nursing facilities) now reporting cases, with the likelihood of thousands of deaths.6 Mass testing of the residents in skilled nursing facilities will allow appropriate isolation of infected residents so that they can be cared for and quarantine of exposed residents to minimize the risk of spread. Mass testing in these facilities could also allow cohorting7 and some resumption of group activities in a nonoutbreak setting. Routine rRT-PCR testing in addition to symptomatic screening of new residents before entry, conservative guidelines for discontinuation of isolation,7 and periodic retesting of long-term residents, as well as both periodic rRT-PCR screening and surgical masking of all staff, are important concomitant measures.\nThere are approximately 1.3 million Americans currently residing in nursing homes.8 Although this recommendation for mass testing in skilled nursing facilities could be initially rolled out in geographic areas with high rates of community Covid-19 transmission, an argument can be made to extend this recommendation to all U.S.-based skilled nursing facilities now because case ascertainment is uneven and incomplete and because of the devastating consequences of outbreaks. Immediately enforceable alternatives to mass testing in skilled nursing facilities are few. The public health director of Los Angeles has recommended that families remove their loved ones from nursing homes,9 a measure that is not feasible for many families.\nAsymptomatic transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is the Achilles\u2019 heel of Covid-19 pandemic control through the public health strategies we have currently deployed. Symptom-based screening has utility, but epidemiologic evaluations of Covid-19 outbreaks within skilled nursing facilities such as the one described by Arons et al. strongly demonstrate that our current approaches are inadequate. This recommendation for SARS-CoV-2 testing of asymptomatic persons in skilled nursing facilities should most likely be expanded to other congregate living situations, such as prisons and jails (where outbreaks in the United States, whose incarceration rate is much higher than rates in other countries, are increasing), enclosed mental health facilities, and homeless shelters, and to hospitalized inpatients. Current U.S. testing capability must increase immediately for this strategy to be implemented.\nUltimately, the rapid spread of Covid-19 across the United States and the globe, the clear evidence of SARS-CoV-2 transmission from asymptomatic persons,5 and the eventual need to relax current social distancing practices argue for broadened SARS-CoV-2 testing to include asymptomatic persons in prioritized settings. These factors also support the case for the general public to use face masks10 when in crowded outdoor or indoor spaces.

As billions of dollars flow into research and development efforts aimed at controlling the virus, the pandemic response remains hamstrung by our limited understanding of how to generate effective immunity, particularly in the elderly.\nAs we age, health conditions associated with aging, particularly noncommunicable diseases such as heart disease, cancers, and metabolic and autoimmune diseases, combined with treatments for these diseases and with immune senescence, substantially affect responses to vaccines and infectious diseases.1 Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) has been identified as the receptor for SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19, and it has been suggested that differential levels of ACE2 in the cardiac and pulmonary tissues of younger versus older adults may be at least partially responsible for the spectrum of disease virulence observed among patients with Covid-19. These findings have led to debate regarding the potential use of ACE inhibitors in the context of the pandemic.2 This idea highlights the need for longitudinal studies in aging populations \u2014 such as the Rotterdam Study (a prospective cohort study focused on cardiovascular, neurologic, ophthalmologic, and endocrine diseases) \u2014 to examine the impact of coexisting conditions and therapies on the effects of vaccines and infectious diseases.\nSign up for the Weekly Table of Contents email.\nEach week, receive an email with links to the articles published in the current week's issue of the New England Journal of Medicine. SIGN UP\nEven as the brunt of severe illness from Covid-19 is being borne by aging adults, we are navigating partially blind in efforts to develop vaccines and therapies to stop this and future pandemics, since we lack knowledge of the mechanisms of immunity to protect this population. If we can delineate principles of effective immunity in the elderly, we might also be able to develop new strategies for broader disease prevention and control in older populations.\nCovid-19 has highlighted the vulnerability of aging populations to emerging diseases. This susceptibility to disease and death is also a major challenge for the development of vaccines and immunotherapeutic agents. Numerous studies have shown that vaccine efficacy decreases significantly with age, a reduction that is thought to be driven by the progressive age-related decline of innate and adaptive immune responses.3 Yet we know that some older people are protected by generally poorly performing vaccines, and some vaccines work very well in elderly populations: the Shingrix vaccine for shingles, for example, is 90% effective in people over 70. What accounts for the variability in immune responses from one elderly person to another? How can we use our understanding of this variability in developing new and improved vaccines and therapies?\nFar from being mere academic exercises, the answers to these questions are critical to the future of global health. The Covid-19 experience in aging populations offers a window into the profound, long-term, global demographic challenges the world is facing. According to the United Nations, projections indicate that by 2050 there will be more than twice as many people over 65 as there are children under 5, and the number of people 65 years of age or older globally will surpass the number of people 15 to 24 years of age.4\nThis global aging will create widespread public health challenges, dramatically increasing the burden of noncommunicable diseases and exposing our vulnerability to infectious diseases. The number of deaths related to antimicrobial resistance is projected to reach 10 million per year by 2050, exceeding mortality from cancer. Climate change could put an additional 1 billion people at risk from tropical vectorborne diseases, and potentially pandemic diseases are emerging with greater frequency. Protecting aging populations will be a central, if not the primary, question in maintaining global health and biosecurity.\nRecent technological advances in biomedical and computer sciences provide an unprecedented opportunity to decode the human immune system. Innovations in systems biology applied in clinical immunology studies now allow immensely detailed measurements of human transcriptomic, proteomic, immune, and metabolic responses. Such studies have already led to improved understanding of the extent to which human responses within a population vary on several parameters, and of the influence of the microbiome in host immunity, leading to considerations for novel vaccination and immune-therapeutic strategies.5 For example, many baseline \u201comic\u201d signatures predictive of vaccine-induced immunity have been associated with innate immune parameters, which suggests that specific and novel immunomodulators may enhance future vaccines and immunotherapies.\nMoreover, advances in bioinformatics, causal inference, and artificial intelligence (AI) \u2014 building on AI advances from other fields, such as biomedical imaging \u2014 enable analyses of large-scale data sets that can help in determining the key elements and principles of effective human immunity. These tools offer the potential for elucidating the mechanisms that differentiate people who have a response to vaccines from those who do not, and for clarifying why some people develop effective immune responses to disease. These answers should provide the basis for accelerating the discovery and development of new vaccines, diagnostics, and therapies for major diseases. Generating systems-biology data on an unprecedented scale should also enable computational scientists to begin to develop AI models of human immunity, which, if successful, could transform product development, enabling computer-generated simulation trials to facilitate faster and cheaper development, with a much greater probability of success.\nInnovative new studies are needed to investigate questions of why some people have stronger responses to vaccines or diseases than others so that we can better prevent and treat disease. This undertaking will require a global approach and a radically new vision \u2014 one that spans diseases and sectors of society, bringing together academia, industry, government, and philanthropic organizations. Covid-19 is already catalyzing collaboration among these sectors, and this work must continue beyond the pandemic.\nThus, the tools are now available to decipher the principles of effective immunity in aging populations. If investigators study cohorts of elderly people longitudinally and globally and probe their immune systems with licensed vaccines to distinguish people with effective responses from those without, and apply cutting-edge tools from systems biology and AI, it should be feasible to identify biomarkers for effective immunity in this population, which could then be applied to other vulnerable populations, such as those living in low- and middle-income countries. Over the long term, the research agenda will need to include cultivation of a new generation of multidisciplinary scientists trained in biomedical, informatics, and computer sciences in order to fully prepare for the next wave of emerging diseases.\nCovid-19 is highly transmissible, causes relatively high mortality, particularly in aging populations, and has emerged globally in our highly interconnected world. Short-term efforts to quickly develop lifesaving vaccines and therapeutics are of the utmost importance.\nIn the long term, however, we will have to shift from investing primarily in disease-specific research to simultaneously targeting sufficient resources toward decoding the human immune system, particularly for the world\u2019s most vulnerable populations. Such an effort could accelerate the development of new vaccines, diagnostics, and treatments \u2014 not just for Covid-19, but also for future emerging pathogens as well as the noncommunicable diseases of aging that are our major global killers.

Women\u2019s ability to determine whether and when they have a child has profound consequences for their self-determination and for the economic, social, and political equality of women as a group. Because access to safe abortion care is time-sensitive and vitally important, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) and other reproductive health professional organizations issued an unequivocal statement on March 18, 2020, that they \u201cdo not support Covid-19 responses that cancel or delay abortion procedures.\u201d\nDespite ACOG\u2019s position, governors in a number of states have called for a halt to abortion care throughout the Covid-19 epidemic.

SIGN UP\nThese governors, who have worked to restrict access to abortion in the past, have categorized abortion procedures as \u201celective\u201d or \u201cnonessential.\u201d Lawsuits challenging the orders are pending. As of April 8, 2020, temporary restraining orders (TROs) have blocked state bans while litigation proceeds in Ohio, Alabama, and Oklahoma. In Texas, a TRO granted by a district court was reversed by the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, thereby halting abortions once more. The orders have had immediate effects on patients; thousands of women have already been turned away from abortion care. Given the potential effects on thousands more women if states suspend abortion care throughout the Covid-19 outbreak, the president of the American Medical Association (AMA) issued a statement on March 30, 2020, in support of continued access to abortion and explaining that physicians, not politicians, should decide which procedures can be delayed.\nThe new restrictive state policies highlight the vulnerability of abortion care in the United States. Abortion is an essential health service. The Covid-19 outbreak has illuminated several weaknesses in our health care system, and one lesson should be that our system of abortion care delivery must be strengthened in ways that prevent abortion access from being so easily rescinded in times of health system stress, whether minor or substantial.\nPoliticians and others advocating for the closure of abortion clinics claim that their goal is to increase the availability of personal protective equipment (PPE) for medical staff treating Covid-19. But this argument doesn\u2019t make sense. Women who are unable to obtain an abortion will either remain pregnant and require prenatal care and support during delivery or may use dangerous methods to induce an abortion on their own, as was more common historically when abortion care was unavailable. Both these scenarios could lead to much more contact with clinicians and greater need for PPE, thereby increasing risks to both patients and staff.\nRather than being about preservation of PPE, the abortion restrictions imposed in recent weeks are the latest round in a long-running debate about whether abortion is a legitimate health care service. \u201cElective\u201d abortion has been physically separated from other routine health care services; it is predominantly performed in independent clinics, even though it could be performed in most private obstetrics and gynecology practices. The national discourse has also portrayed abortion providers as \u201coutside\u201d health care, misrepresenting them as a distinct set of physicians with suspect professional motivations who must be regulated with special laws. The idea of \u201cabortion exceptionalism\u201d is propagated in part by people motivated by a desire to make abortion illegal or inaccessible, and policymakers of this mindset have enacted hundreds of new abortion restrictions over the past 10 years.1\nBut the procedure has also been marginalized by health care professionals who support abortion care in the abstract yet seek to avoid controversy by distancing themselves from \u201celective\u201d abortion. The commonness of abortion in the United States suggests that most physicians personally know someone who has chosen to end a pregnancy, and most also care every day for people who have relied on safe, legal, and accessible abortion services. However, a desire not to be associated with the politics surrounding abortion has led to a lack of solidarity in the medical profession that leaves the physicians who are providing pregnancy-termination services in the midst of a pandemic more vulnerable than ever.2\nThe historical misclassification of most abortions as \u201celective\u201d is also central to the vulnerability of abortion care. There is no debate that a minority of abortions are necessary to prevent death or serious physical harm. But this strictly medical model fails to capture the reality that the nonmedical reasons that women exercise their constitutional right to abortion are often as important to them and their families as averting a serious health consequence. The long-standing insistence on using the word \u201celective\u201d to describe the vast majority of abortions frames women\u2019s equality as a luxury and women\u2019s autonomy as expendable. Categorizing abortions as \u201celective\u201d or \u201ctherapeutic\u201d is more of a moral judgment than a medical judgment,3 and it allows people who use these terms to determine a woman\u2019s level of deservingness on the basis of her reason for choosing to pursue abortion.4 In the rest of medicine, classifying a surgical procedure as \u201celective\u201d doesn\u2019t determine whether or where it will be done. Instead, it denotes that a case can be planned and scheduled, as opposed to an \u201curgent\u201d case that cannot be delayed without causing harm to the patient. Under the current circumstances, many hospitals are appropriately rescheduling procedures for which the outcome will not be worsened by a surgical delay. However, the surgical complexity of abortion procedures and the associated risks increase with each passing week, and since most states impose upper limits on the gestational age at which abortion can be performed, delaying procedures will mean that many women will be unable to obtain an abortion at all.\nIn ordinary times, access to abortion is essential because deciding whether and when to bear a child is central to women\u2019s self-determination and equal participation in society. During the Covid-19 pandemic, such access is even more important. Millions of women under quarantine or shelter-in-place orders may have reduced access to contraception; many ambulatory clinics have restricted or halted outpatient visits, including those for placement of contraceptive devices, and women may have difficulty traveling safely to a pharmacy. It is also possible that increased time at home will increase couples\u2019 sexual activity. The Covid-19 response has already brought about substantial financial hardship for many families, and not having the money to support a child (or an additional child) is a leading reason that women choose to have an abortion.5 Finally, quarantine and shelter-in-place orders have increased intimate partner violence, which sometimes includes sexual coercion and assault that may result in unplanned pregnancies.\nThe medical profession\u2019s response to the Covid-19 pandemic must include continuing to meet other urgent health care needs, including the need for time-sensitive abortion care. The speed with which some governors have suspended abortion care during this pandemic highlights the extreme vulnerability of abortion access in the United States. We believe that the current global crisis requires the medical profession to speak with a unified voice on several topics, including access to abortion care. We call for all medical professionals to stand in solidarity with ACOG and the AMA, with the women and couples who need the option of pregnancy termination, and with their colleagues who serve these patients. If the entire profession can actively support abortion care as an essential health service during the Covid-19 pandemic, such unity could form a foundation for strengthening our abortion care infrastructure for years to come.\nDisclosure forms provided by the authors are available at NEJM.org.\nThis article was published on April 9, 2020, at NEJM.org.\nAuthor Affiliations\nFrom Harvard Medical School (M.J.B., D.B.) and the Department of Obstetrics, Gynecology and Reproductive Biology, Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital (D.B.) \u2014 both in Boston; and the Departments of Medical Social Sciences, Medical Education, and Obstetrics and Gynecology, Feinberg School of Medicine, Northwestern University, Chicago (K.L.W.).\nSupplementary Material\nDisclosure Forms PDF 167KB\nReferences (5)\nCiting Article (1)", "10.1056/NEJMp2007466": "1 Reference\nIn early March 2020, Ms. B., a woman in her mid-70s, was admitted from her nursing home to Seattle Harborview\u2019s medical ICU with suspected Covid-19. When she rapidly decompensated, the ICU team resuscitated her as they would any patient: central line, fluids, pressors. But when it became clear that her death was imminent, providing supportive end-of-life care proved more difficult. Because Ms. B. had been quarantined in the nursing home for several days, her family was already quite distressed about not being able to see her. And the hospital\u2019s strict visitor policy meant that even if they could get there quickly enough, their time at her bedside, if they were allowed any at all, would be severely limited.\nFor Courtney Enix, a senior resident who cared for Ms. B. and other patients with Covid-19 during her recent ICU rotation, Ms. B.\u2019s clinical course exposed the difficulty of maintaining standards of care amid the pandemic\u2019s constraints. In an effort to limit exposure, ICU team members alternated time at the bedside, so Enix spent the majority of the time outside the room, admitting other patients, returning pages, and updating Ms. B.\u2019s family. She was on the phone with Ms. B.\u2019s son, eyeing the telemetry, when the patient\u2019s heart slowed and she died. Though this experience was particularly wrenching, the sense of disconnectedness was not unique to Ms. B. \u201cWe\u2019re still trying to figure out how to give these patients a \u2018good death,\u2019\u201d Enix told me. \u201cWatching patients spend their remaining days isolated and alone is devastating.\u201d\nSign up for the Weekly Table of Contents email.\nEach week, receive an email with links to the articles published in the current week's issue of the New England Journal of Medicine. SIGN UP\nRecognizing the resulting moral distress, the hospital began involving the palliative care service as soon as a critically ill patient with Covid-19 was admitted. But determining how best to care for patients at the end of life is just one of countless challenges Seattle-area health care workers faced as they bore the initial brunt of the U.S. epidemic. Though the challenges are diverse, behind them all lies a fundamental tension: How do we effectively care for patients with Covid-19 while protecting ourselves, our other patients, and our communities from further viral spread? Health care workers on the front lines must not only constantly grapple with this unusual calculus, but also somehow manage the resulting emotional dissonance.\nDescribing the chaos caused by constantly changing and conflicting guidance, the challenges related to shortages of tests and personal protective equipment (PPE), and the terrifying uncertainty about what\u2019s coming next, Megan Reitz, a Seattle family medicine doctor, said, \u201cIt\u2019s like a wave about to break, but you\u2019re not sure which way it\u2019s heading or what\u2019s in the way.\u201d\nOne theme that emerged from my conversations with health care workers on Seattle\u2019s front lines was the need for clear leadership and guidance. As Jennelle Badulak, a University of Washington (UW Medicine) intensivist and emergency medicine physician who has helped lead her institution\u2019s response, told me, \u201cIn a time of fear and uncertainty, the best thing to have is a protocol.\u201d Badulak\u2019s general advice to hospitals is to be nimble in developing these protocols, given the rapid pace of learning. But she also warns that protocol modifications cause more anxiety than solace when they reflect the need to ration resources rather than reflecting data on safest practices. The consternation among health care workers when the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended using bandanas when no masks are available was a case in point.\nThose tasked with leading their institutional charge find themselves juggling the imperative to offer their workforce clear guidance on best practices, thereby allaying some fear, with the need to be transparent about resource constraints. Reviewing the practices of China, for instance, suggests that far more extensive PPE use can dramatically reduce infection rates among health care workers.1 Though under normal circumstances, we would reject guidelines that did not reflect the highest-quality evidence, in the face of dwindling resources, the workforce seemingly has no choice but to make the most of what is available.\nHow do these constraints affect patient care? Mark Wurfel, one of the first intensivists at Seattle\u2019s Harborview Hospital to care for patients with Covid-19, said one of the biggest challenges involved diagnostic tests. Even obtaining something as routine as a chest x-ray was difficult because it required a radiology technician to enter the room, consuming precious PPE, and rendered the machine unusable for other patients without a deep cleaning. But with some ingenuity, the nurses and radiology techs developed a workaround. The nurse would move the bed up to the window of the door and sit the patient as upright as possible, with the plate behind the patient, allowing the tech and the machine to stay outside the door.\nCT scans, however, proved more difficult. As Wurfel explained, in the best-case scenario, you send someone to the scanner, the scan\u2019s done in 15 to 20 minutes, and the machine is disinfected (though long cleanings after patients with Covid-19 disrupt workflow for the rest of the hospital). Unfortunately, critically ill patients who most need imaging also tend to be the most unstable. Wurfel told me about a patient who had respiratory decompensation inside the scanner, necessitating bag\u2013mask ventilation. \u201cIt\u2019s the worst place to have to manage copious endotracheal secretions that are potentially infectious,\u201d he said. This scenario also highlights the need for hypervigilance among patients who are presumed not to have Covid-19. This patient, for instance, initially presented with stroke symptoms, but a further history obtained from the family raised suspicion for Covid-19 infection, which was later confirmed.\nGiven mounting PPE shortages and the rising death toll from Covid-19 among health care workers globally, such scenarios induce terror and necessitate rethinking of routine standards of care. Should we run to codes of patients with known or suspected Covid-19? Should physicians refuse to intubate a patient unless they have adequate PPE? Should we offer bedside comfort to the elderly patient with possible Covid-19 who becomes increasingly delirious as unrecognizable health care workers speed in and out of the room while TV coverage of the pandemic drones on in the background? The clarion call of the profession \u2014 to put our patients\u2019 needs above our own \u2014 is far less directive when meeting one patient\u2019s needs may leave us too ill to care for the next. As David Walton, a hospitalist at Boston\u2019s Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital who has been on the front lines of infectious disease outbreaks in Africa and Haiti, pointed out, negotiating these trade-offs is highly unusual, particularly for U.S. clinicians. \u201cThe challenge of taking really good care of patients with the precautions we need to care for ourselves is new for us.\u201d\nTo Nick Mark, an intensivist at Seattle\u2019s Swedish Medical Center whose young physician colleague was critically ill with Covid-19 when we spoke, the threat to health care workers is palpable. Predicting a workforce shortage, Mark likened the epidemic to a marathon, emphasizing that \u201cwe are only on mile 2 or 3.\u201d Particularly worrisome to him are the intense ventilatory needs of patients with Covid-19\u2013associated acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). \u201cPeople tend to think of machines as magic and undervalue the people who [operate] them,\u201d Mark said. Noting the widespread calls for physicians from other specialties to pitch in, Mark noted how few among us actually know how to intubate, manage ventilators, or insert chest tubes.\nReflecting on other challenges, Mark lamented the absence from the hospital of patients\u2019 family members, who provide comfort and often translate for critically ill patients who can\u2019t communicate. \u201cEveryone is worried about not having sufficient ventilators,\u201d he said. \u201cI am worried about not having sufficient compassion and not having sufficient people.\u201d\nWhen it comes to protecting the workforce from infection, an adequate supply of PPE is the first priority, and it is unconscionable that supplies are lacking. But many people I spoke with emphasized that even if physical risk is minimized, we need to tend to the workforce\u2019s emotional well-being in the face of pervasive and well-warranted fear. Given concerns about inadequate protection, knowledge that we might expose other people, and awareness that people we love will die, telling people on the front lines not to be scared is like asking them not to breathe. But if compassion has sometimes been a necessary casualty of our attempts to save as many lives as possible, what struck me about Washington\u2019s front lines was how clearly the workforce\u2019s fundamental humanity shone through.\nEvergreenHealth, just east of Seattle, is the hospital where the nation\u2019s first influx of coronavirus patients received care. David Reed, the environmental services manager there, told me that though his team is used to \u201ccleaning up all kinds of icky, scary stuff,\u201d anxiety about Covid-19 compels him to tend more to his staff\u2019s emotional needs. So Reed spends more time than usual checking in with the workers who clean rooms, making sure they feel confident in their ability to protect themselves. The supportive spirit trickles down to his team leaders: Warren Julve, who leads the day-shift team, is highly attuned to his team\u2019s fears. One typically fearless team member, for instance, entered a room that had been occupied by a patient with Covid-19 and just stopped. \u201cI\u2019m scared,\u201d she told Julve. \u201cI can\u2019t do this.\u201d So Julve cleaned the room with her, reminding her that they know how to protect themselves, the staff, and patients. \u201cThat sort of sensitivity to what people are feeling is more important now than ever,\u201d Reed told me.\nSensitivity to the well-being of medical trainees was emphasized by many people as well, and it will continue to be a nationwide focus of discussion if workforce shortages intensify. Though initially UW Medicine intended to keep trainees from caring for patients with Covid-19, it quickly became clear that that was operationally impossible. Mindful of trainee well-being, however, the residency program created a \u201cno questions asked\u201d policy, allowing house staff to opt out of caring for infected patients. Nevertheless, as Douglas Leedy, one of UW Medicine\u2019s chief residents, told me, residents overwhelmingly preferred to be on the front lines. Leedy said he had been inundated with email from house staff offering to help by, say, coming off elective rotations or giving up vacation. Leedy was not surprised by the outpouring of support. \u201cA lot of us health care workers go into medicine for moments like this,\u201d he said.\nSharukh Lokhandwala, an intensivist at EvergreenHealth, was similarly struck by the nearly universal urge to help the community get through this crisis. Lokhandwala recalled, in particular, a patient in her 70s with refractory ARDS. After he\u2019d explained to her family, on the phone, the terminal nature of her disease, they agreed to transition to supportive care. A morphine infusion was started and the patient was extubated. A few minutes later, Lokhandwala looked up from his workstation and saw a nurse in PPE, comforting the patient. The nurse rubbed the patient\u2019s arm, told her that her daughter wished she could be with her, and held her hand until she died.\nAs the pandemic spreads around the world, we\u2019ll continue to be plagued by resource constraints that will compromise our ability to protect ourselves, our patients, and our communities. But as Seattle\u2019s response to Covid-19 reminds us, the professional spirit marches on, unconstrained.\nDisclosure forms provided by the author are available at NEJM.org.\nThis article was published on April 1, 2020, at NEJM.org.\nAuthor Affiliations\nDr. Rosenbaum is a national correspondent for the Journal.\nSupplementary Material\nDisclosure Forms PDF 148KB\nReference (1)", "10.1056/NEJMsb2005114": "39 References\n65 Citing Articles\nLetters\nCovid-19 is officially a pandemic. It is a novel infection with serious clinical manifestations, including death, and it has reached at least 124 countries and territories. Although the ultimate course and impact of Covid-19 are uncertain, it is not merely possible but likely that the disease will produce enough severe illness to overwhelm health care infrastructure. Emerging viral pandemics \u201ccan place extraordinary and sustained demands on public health and health systems and on providers of essential community services.\u201d1 Such demands will create the need to ration medical equipment and interventions.\nRationing is already here. In the United States, perhaps the earliest example was the near-immediate recognition that there were not enough high-filtration N-95 masks for health care workers, prompting contingency guidance on how to reuse masks designed for single use.2 Physicians in Italy have proposed directing crucial resources such as intensive care beds and ventilators to patients who can benefit most from treatment.3,4 Daegu, South Korea \u2014 home to most of that country\u2019s Covid-19 cases \u2014 faced a hospital bed shortage, with some patients dying at home while awaiting admission.5 In the United Kingdom, protective gear requirements for health workers have been downgraded, causing condemnation among providers.6 The rapidly growing imbalance between supply and demand for medical resources in many countries presents an inherently normative question: How can medical resources be allocated fairly during a Covid-19 pandemic?\nHealth Impacts of Moderate-to-Severe Pandemics\nTable 1.\nPotential U.S. Health and Health Care Effects of Pandemic Covid-19 as Compared with Influenza.\nIn 2005, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) developed a Pandemic Influenza Plan that modeled the potential health care impact of moderate and severe influenza pandemics. The plan was updated after the 2009 H1N1 outbreak and most recently in 2017.1 It suggests that a moderate pandemic will infect about 64 million Americans, with about 800,000 (1.25%) requiring hospitalization and 160,000 (0.25%) requiring beds in the intensive care unit (ICU) (Table 1).1 A severe pandemic would dramatically increase these demands (Table 1).\nModeling the Covid-19 pandemic is challenging. But there are data that can be used to project resource demands. Estimates of the reproductive number (R) of SARS-CoV-2 show that at the beginning of the epidemic, each infected person spreads the virus to at least two others, on average.10 A conservatively low estimate is that 5% of the population could become infected within 3 months. Preliminary data from China and Italy regarding the distribution of case severity and fatality vary widely.7,8 A recent large-scale analysis from China suggests that 80% of those infected either are asymptomatic or have mild symptoms, a finding that implies that demand for advanced medical services might apply to only 20% of the total infected. Of patients infected with Covid-19, about 15% have severe illness and 5% have critical illness.8 Overall mortality ranges from 0.25% to as high as 3.0%.11 Case fatality rates are much higher for vulnerable populations, such as persons over the age of 80 years (>14%) and those with coexisting conditions (10% for those with cardiovascular disease and 7% for those with diabetes).8 Overall, Covid-19 is substantially deadlier than seasonal influenza, which has mortality of roughly 0.1%.\nThe exact number of cases will depend on a number of factors that are unknowable at this time, including the effect of social distancing and other interventions. However, the estimate given above \u2014 that 5% of the population is infected \u2014 is low; new data are only likely to increase estimates of sickness and demand for health care infrastructure.\nHealth System Capacity\nEven a conservative estimate shows that the health needs created by the coronavirus pandemic go well beyond the capacity of U.S. hospitals.9 According to the American Hospital Association, there were 5198 community hospitals and 209 federal hospitals in the United States in 2018. In the community hospitals, there were 792,417 beds, with 3532 emergency departments and 96,500 ICU beds, of which 23,000 were neonatal and 5100 pediatric, leaving just under 68,400 ICU beds of all types for the adult population.12 Other estimates of ICU bed capacity, which try to account for purported undercounting in the American Hospital Association data, show a total of 85,000 adult ICU beds of all types.13\nThere are approximately 62,000 full-featured ventilators (the type needed to adequately treat the most severe complications of Covid-19) available in the United States.14 Approximately 10,000 to 20,000 more are estimated to be on call in our Strategic National Stockpile,15 and 98,000 ventilators that are not full-featured but can provide basic function in an emergency during crisis standards of care also exist.14 Supply limitations constrain the rapid production of more ventilators; manufacturers are unsure of how many they can make in the next year.16 However, in the Covid-19 pandemic, the limiting factor for ventilator use will most likely not be ventilators but healthy respiratory therapists and trained critical care staff to operate them safely over three shifts every day. In 2018, community hospitals employed about 76,000 full-time respiratory therapists,12 and there are about 512,000 critical care nurses \u2014 of which ICU nurses are a subset.17 California law requires one respiratory therapist for every four ventilated patients; thus, this number of respiratory therapists could care for a maximum of 100,000 patients daily (25,000 respiratory therapists per shift).\nGiven these numbers \u2014 and unless the epidemic curve of infected individuals is flattened over a very long period of time \u2014 the Covid-19 pandemic is likely to cause a shortage of hospital beds, ICU beds, and ventilators. It is also likely to affect the availability of the medical workforce, since doctors and nurses are already becoming ill or quarantined.18 Even in a moderate pandemic, hospital beds and ventilators are likely to be scarce in geographic areas with large outbreaks, such as Seattle, or in rural and smaller hospitals that have much less space, staff, and supplies than large academic medical centers.\nDiagnostic, therapeutic, and preventive interventions will also be scarce. Pharmaceuticals like chloroquine, remdesivir, and favipiravir are currently undergoing clinical trials, and other experimental treatments are at earlier stages of study.19-21 Even if one of them proves effective, scaling up supply will take time.22 The use of convalescent serum, blood products from persons whose immune system has defeated Covid-19, is being contemplated as a possible treatment and preventive intervention.19 Likewise, if an effective vaccine is developed, it will take time to produce, distribute, and administer. Other critical medical supplies and equipment, such as personal protective equipment (PPE), are already scarce, presenting the danger that medical staff time will itself become scarce as physicians and nurses become infected.2 Technical and governmental failures in the United States have led to a persistent scarcity of tests.23 As more countries have been affected by Covid-19, worldwide demand for tests has begun to outstrip production, creating the need to prioritize patients.\nPublic health measures known to reduce viral spread, such as social distancing, cough etiquette, and hand hygiene, finally seem to be a U.S. national priority and may make resource shortages less severe by narrowing the gap between medical need and the available supply of treatments. But public health mitigation efforts do not obviate the need to adequately prepare for the allocation of scarce resources before it becomes necessary.\nThe choice to set limits on access to treatment is not a discretionary decision, but a necessary response to the overwhelming effects of a pandemic. The question is not whether to set priorities, but how to do so ethically and consistently, rather than basing decisions on individual institutions\u2019 approaches or a clinician\u2019s intuition in the heat of the moment.\nEthical Values for Rationing Health Resources in a Pandemic\nPrevious proposals for allocation of resources in pandemics and other settings of absolute scarcity, including our own prior research and analysis, converge on four fundamental values: maximizing the benefits produced by scarce resources, treating people equally, promoting and rewarding instrumental value, and giving priority to the worst off.24-29 Consensus exists that an individual person\u2019s wealth should not determine who lives or dies.24-33 Although medical treatment in the United States outside pandemic contexts is often restricted to those able to pay, no proposal endorses ability-to-pay allocation in a pandemic.24-33\nTable 2.\nEthical Values to Guide Rationing of Absolutely Scarce Health Care Resources in a Covid-19 Pandemic.\nEach of these four values can be operationalized in various ways (Table 2). Maximization of benefits can be understood as saving the most individual lives or as saving the most life-years by giving priority to patients likely to survive longest after treatment.24,26,28,29 Treating people equally could be attempted by random selection, such as a lottery, or by a first-come, first-served allocation.24,28 Instrumental value could be promoted by giving priority to those who can save others, or rewarded by giving priority to those who have saved others in the past.24,29 And priority to the worst off could be understood as giving priority either to the sickest or to younger people who will have lived the shortest lives if they die untreated.24,28-30\nThe proposals for allocation discussed above also recognize that all these ethical values and ways to operationalize them are compelling. No single value is sufficient alone to determine which patients should receive scarce resources.24-33 Hence, fair allocation requires a multivalue ethical framework that can be adapted, depending on the resource and context in question.24-33\nWho Gets Health Resources in a Covid-19 Pandemic?\nThese ethical values \u2014 maximizing benefits, treating equally, promoting and rewarding instrumental value, and giving priority to the worst off \u2014 yield six specific recommendations for allocating medical resources in the Covid-19 pandemic: maximize benefits; prioritize health workers; do not allocate on a first-come, first-served basis; be responsive to evidence; recognize research participation; and apply the same principles to all Covid-19 and non\u2013Covid-19 patients.\nRecommendation 1: In the context of a pandemic, the value of maximizing benefits is most important.3,26,28,29,31-33 This value reflects the importance of responsible stewardship of resources: it is difficult to justify asking health care workers and the public to take risks and make sacrifices if the promise that their efforts will save and lengthen lives is illusory.29 Priority for limited resources should aim both at saving the most lives and at maximizing improvements in individuals\u2019 post-treatment length of life. Saving more lives and more years of life is a consensus value across expert reports.26,28,29 It is consistent both with utilitarian ethical perspectives that emphasize population outcomes and with nonutilitarian views that emphasize the paramount value of each human life.34 There are many reasonable ways of balancing saving more lives against saving more years of life30; whatever balance between lives and life-years is chosen must be applied consistently.\nLimited time and information in a Covid-19 pandemic make it justifiable to give priority to maximizing the number of patients that survive treatment with a reasonable life expectancy and to regard maximizing improvements in length of life as a subordinate aim. The latter becomes relevant only in comparing patients whose likelihood of survival is similar. Limited time and information during an emergency also counsel against incorporating patients\u2019 future quality of life, and quality-adjusted life-years, into benefit maximization. Doing so would require time-consuming collection of information and would present ethical and legal problems.28,34 However, encouraging all patients, especially those facing the prospect of intensive care, to document in an advance care directive what future quality of life they would regard as acceptable and when they would refuse ventilators or other life-sustaining interventions can be appropriate.\nOperationalizing the value of maximizing benefits means that people who are sick but could recover if treated are given priority over those who are unlikely to recover even if treated and those who are likely to recover without treatment. Because young, severely ill patients will often comprise many of those who are sick but could recover with treatment, this operationalization also has the effect of giving priority to those who are worst off in the sense of being at risk of dying young and not having a full life.25,29,30\nBecause maximizing benefits is paramount in a pandemic, we believe that removing a patient from a ventilator or an ICU bed to provide it to others in need is also justifiable and that patients should be made aware of this possibility at admission.3,28,29,33,35 Undoubtedly, withdrawing ventilators or ICU support from patients who arrived earlier to save those with better prognosis will be extremely psychologically traumatic for clinicians \u2014 and some clinicians might refuse to do so. However, many guidelines agree that the decision to withdraw a scarce resource to save others is not an act of killing and does not require the patient\u2019s consent.26,28,29,33,35 We agree with these guidelines that it is the ethical thing to do.26 Initially allocating beds and ventilators according to the value of maximizing benefits could help reduce the need for withdrawal.\nRecommendation 2: Critical Covid-19 interventions \u2014 testing, PPE, ICU beds, ventilators, therapeutics, and vaccines \u2014 should go first to front-line health care workers and others who care for ill patients and who keep critical infrastructure operating, particularly workers who face a high risk of infection and whose training makes them difficult to replace.27 These workers should be given priority not because they are somehow more worthy, but because of their instrumental value: they are essential to pandemic response.27,28 If physicians and nurses are incapacitated, all patients \u2014 not just those with Covid-19 \u2014 will suffer greater mortality and years of life lost. Whether health workers who need ventilators will be able to return to work is uncertain, but giving them priority for ventilators recognizes their assumption of the high-risk work of saving others, and it may also discourage absenteeism.28,36 Priority for critical workers must not be abused by prioritizing wealthy or famous persons or the politically powerful above first responders and medical staff \u2014 as has already happened for testing.37 Such abuses will undermine trust in the allocation framework.\nRecommendation 3: For patients with similar prognoses, equality should be invoked and operationalized through random allocation, such as a lottery, rather than a first-come, first-served allocation process. First-come, first-served is used for such resources as transplantable kidneys, where scarcity is long-standing and patients can survive without the scarce resource. Conversely, treatments for coronavirus address urgent need, meaning that a first-come, first-served approach would unfairly benefit patients living nearer to health facilities. And first-come, first-served medication or vaccine distribution would encourage crowding and even violence during a period when social distancing is paramount. Finally, first-come, first-served approaches mean that people who happen to get sick later on, perhaps because of their strict adherence to recommended public health measures, are excluded from treatment, worsening outcomes without improving fairness.33 In the face of time pressure and limited information, random selection is also preferable to trying to make finer-grained prognostic judgments within a group of roughly similar patients.\nRecommendation 4: Prioritization guidelines should differ by intervention and should respond to changing scientific evidence. For instance, younger patients should not be prioritized for Covid-19 vaccines, which prevent disease rather than cure it, or for experimental post- or pre-exposure prophylaxis. Covid-19 outcomes have been significantly worse in older persons and those with chronic conditions.8 Invoking the value of maximizing saving lives justifies giving older persons priority for vaccines immediately after health care workers and first responders. If the vaccine supply is insufficient for patients in the highest risk categories \u2014 those over 60 years of age or with coexisting conditions \u2014 then equality supports using random selection, such as a lottery, for vaccine allocation.24,28 Invoking instrumental value justifies prioritizing younger patients for vaccines only if epidemiologic modeling shows that this would be the best way to reduce viral spread and the risk to others.\nEpidemiologic modeling is even more relevant in setting priorities for coronavirus testing. Federal guidance currently gives priority to health care workers and older patients,38 but reserving some tests for public health surveillance (as some states are doing) could improve knowledge about Covid-19 transmission and help researchers target other treatments to maximize benefits.39\nConversely, ICU beds and ventilators are curative rather than preventive. Patients who need them face life-threatening conditions. Maximizing benefits requires consideration of prognosis \u2014 how long the patient is likely to live if treated \u2014 which may mean giving priority to younger patients and those with fewer coexisting conditions. This is consistent with the Italian guidelines that potentially assign a higher priority for intensive care access to younger patients with severe illness than to elderly patients.3,4 Determining the benefit-maximizing allocation of antivirals and other experimental treatments, which are likely to be most effective in patients who are seriously but not critically ill, will depend on scientific evidence. These treatments may produce the most benefit if preferentially allocated to patients who would fare badly on ventilation.\nRecommendation 5: People who participate in research to prove the safety and effectiveness of vaccines and therapeutics should receive some priority for Covid-19 interventions. Their assumption of risk during their participation in research helps future patients, and they should be rewarded for that contribution. These rewards will also encourage other patients to participate in clinical trials. Research participation, however, should serve only as a tiebreaker among patients with similar prognoses.\nRecommendation 6: There should be no difference in allocating scarce resources between patients with Covid-19 and those with other medical conditions. If the Covid-19 pandemic leads to absolute scarcity, that scarcity will affect all patients, including those with heart failure, cancer, and other serious and life-threatening conditions requiring prompt medical attention. Fair allocation of resources that prioritizes the value of maximizing benefits applies across all patients who need resources. For example, a doctor with an allergy who goes into anaphylactic shock and needs life-saving intubation and ventilator support should receive priority over Covid-19 patients who are not frontline health care workers.\nImplementing Rationing Policies\nThe need to balance multiple ethical values for various interventions and in different circumstances is likely to lead to differing judgments about how much weight to give each value in particular cases. This highlights the need for fair and consistent allocation procedures that include the affected parties: clinicians, patients, public officials, and others. These procedures must be transparent to ensure public trust in their fairness.\nThe outcome of these fair allocation procedures, informed by the ethical values and recommendations delineated here, should be the development of prioritization guidelines that ensure that individual physicians are not faced with the terrible task of improvising decisions about whom to treat or making these decisions in isolation. Placing such burdens on individual physicians could exact an acute and life-long emotional toll. However, even well-designed guidelines can present challenging problems in real-time decision making and implementation. To help clinicians navigate these challenges, institutions may employ triage officers, physicians in roles outside direct patient care, or committees of experienced physicians and ethicists, to help apply guidelines, to assist with rationing decisions, or to make and implement choices outright \u2014 relieving the individual front-line clinicians of that burden.26 Institutions may also include appeals processes, but appeals should be limited to concerns about procedural mistakes, given time and resource constraints.29\nConclusions\nGovernments and policy makers must do all they can to prevent the scarcity of medical resources. However, if resources do become scarce, we believe the six recommendations we delineate should be used to develop guidelines that can be applied fairly and consistently across cases. Such guidelines can ensure that individual doctors are never tasked with deciding unaided which patients receive life-saving care and which do not. Instead, we believe guidelines should be provided at a higher level of authority, both to alleviate physician burden and to ensure equal treatment. The described recommendations could shape the development of these guidelines.\nThis article was published on March 23, 2020, at NEJM.org.\nAuthor Affiliations\nFrom the Department of Medical Ethics and Health Policy, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia (E.J.E., A.G., C.Z., C.B.); the University of Denver Sturm College of Law, Denver (G.P.); the Division of Clinical Public Health, Dalla Lana School of Public Health, University of Toronto, Toronto (R.U.), and the School of Health Studies, Western University, London, ON (M.S.) \u2014 both in Canada; the Preventive Medicine Department, Federal University of S\u00e3o Paulo, S\u00e3o Paulo (B.T.); the Wellcome Centre of Ethics and Humanities, the Ethox Centre, University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom (M.P.); and the Department of Emergency Medicine, George Washington University Hospital, Washington, DC (J.P.P.).\nReferences (39)\nCiting Articles (65)\nLetters", "10.1056/NEJMp2006740": "5 References\nCovid-19 has exposed major weaknesses in the United States\u2019 federalist system of public health governance, which divides powers among the federal, state, and local governments. SARS-CoV-2 is exactly the type of infectious disease for which federal public health powers and emergencies were conceived: it is highly transmissible, crosses borders efficiently, and threatens our national infrastructure and economy. Its prevalence varies around the country, with states such as Washington, California, and New York hit particularly hard, but cases are mounting nationwide with appalling velocity. Strong, decisive national action is therefore imperative.\nYet the federal response has been alarmingly slow to develop, fostering confusion about the nature of the virus and necessary steps to address it. States and localities have been at the leading edge of the response but have exercised their public health powers unevenly. Because science-based social distancing and targeted quarantine measures can succeed only if implemented wherever the virus is spreading, the lack of interjurisdictional coordination has and will cost lives.\nSign up for the Weekly Table of Contents email.\nEach week, receive an email with links to the articles published in the current week's issue of the New England Journal of Medicine. SIGN UP\nOur constitutional structure rests primary responsibility for public health with the states and, through delegated authority, cities and counties. In ordinary times, states can exercise broad \u201cpolice power\u201d to protect citizens\u2019 health, subject to constitutionally protected individual rights such as due process, equal protection, and freedom of travel and association. The federal government\u2019s ordinary public health legal authority is more limited and focuses on measures necessary to prevent the interstate or international spread of disease.\nIn extraordinary times, however, states and the federal government can activate emergency powers to expand their ability to act swiftly to protect human life and health.1 As of March 27, 2020, all 50 states, dozens of localities, and the federal government had declared emergencies for Covid-19.2 The resulting executive powers are sweeping; they can range from halting business operations, to restricting freedom of movement, to limiting civil rights and liberties, to commandeering property.1\nThe primary concern regarding this emergency legal framework has long been that it affords officials too much discretion, with too few checks on poor decisions. Usually, the fear is that officials will implement unduly coercive measures in response to public demands to act. For example, during the 2014 Ebola outbreak, New Jersey\u2019s governor ordered a nurse returning from Sierra Leone into quarantine although her case did not merit it under Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines.\nToday, we find ourselves in the opposite situation: the federal government has done too little. Perhaps because of misleading early statements from federal officials about the gravity of the threat, public sentiment has weighed against taking steps that would impose hardship on families and businesses. The tumbling stock market has created further pressure to project a sense of calm and avoid adverse effects on businesses. The resulting laconic federal response has meant that a precious opportunity to contain Covid-19 through swift, unified national action has been lost \u2014 a scenario that mirrors what occurred in Italy.3\nU.S. law provides few viable mechanisms for holding officials accountable for anemic action in response to a health emergency. Federalism is the mainstay \u2014 states and localities can step in to fill a vacuum in national leadership, and many have done so with vigor. For instance, six counties in the San Francisco Bay Area led the issuance of orders requiring residents to remain home and businesses to close except for essential activities.\nAs of April 1, 2020, a total of 72 days after the first reported U.S. case of Covid-19, 33 states and dozens of localities had issued stay-at-home orders, and a handful more had simply instructed nonessential businesses to close, but some orders lack strong enforcement mechanisms (see box). Many jurisdictions continue to permit widespread noncompliance with CDC-issued social-distancing recommendations (e.g., no gatherings of more than 10 people), as evidenced by crowded spring-break beaches, discretionary travel, open schools and day care centers, busy stores selling nonessential goods, contact sports among young adults, and children congregating in public parks.\nSTATE AND LOCAL COVID-19 EMERGENCY STAY-AT-HOME ORDERS, APRIL 1, 2020.*\nSTATEWIDE STAY-AT-HOME ORDERS (EFFECTIVE DATE)\nAlaska (3/28)\nArizona (3/31)\nCalifornia (3/19)\nColorado (3/26)\nDelaware (3/24)\nFlorida (4/3)\nGeorgia (4/3)\nHawaii (3/25)\nIdaho (3/25)\nIllinois (3/21)\nIndiana (3/24)\nKansas (3/30)\nLouisiana (3/23)\nMaine (4/2)\nMaryland (3/30)\nMichigan (3/24)\nMinnesota (3/27)\nMississippi (4/3)\nMontana (3/28)\nNevada (4/1)\nNew Hampshire (3/27)\nNew Jersey (3/21)\nNew Mexico (3/24)\nNew York (3/22)\nNorth Carolina (3/30)\nOhio (3/23)\nOregon (3/23)\nRhode Island (3/28)\nVermont (3/25)\nVirginia (3/30)\nWashington (3/23)\nWest Virginia (3/24)\nWisconsin (3/24)\nSTAY-AT-HOME ORDER IN PARTS OF STATE\nAlabama\nFlorida\nGeorgia\nMaine\nMississippi\nMissouri\nOklahoma\nPennsylvania\nSouth Carolina\nTennessee\nTexas\nUtah\nWyoming\n* Specific policies for stay-at-home orders vary by state. All orders have exceptions for critical activities, but they vary in how they define such activities. Kentucky, Connecticut, Massachusetts, and Tennessee also have advised residents to stay at home but have not ordered them to do so. From Mervosh et al.4\nThis is the dark side of federalism: it encourages a patchwork response to epidemics. States and localities may decide to implement aggressive disease-mitigation measures, but need not do so. The defining feature of the U.S. response to Covid-19 therefore continues to be localized action against a threat that lost its local character weeks ago. The U.S. approach contrasts strikingly with those of South Korea and Taiwan, which have prevented widespread community transmission by rapidly implementing a centralized national strategy. Lacking strong federal leadership to guide a uniform response, the United States quickly fulfilled the World Health Organization\u2019s prediction that it would become the new epicenter of Covid-19.\nWhat more can the federal government do to promote a unified response, particularly as regards community mitigation approaches such as social distancing? There is a clear need to go beyond merely issuing White House and CDC guidelines, because voluntary compliance is not working. A federal takeover of all public health orders would be out of step with our federalist structure, but there are other options.\nFirst, we believe that the White House must reverse its trajectory toward prematurely weakening existing federal measures and instead strengthen the resolve of governors to do all they can to mitigate the impact and spread of the disease, including enforcing stay-at-home orders and school closures and securing adequate medical supplies and tests for their populations (see box).4 At a time when Covid-19 case counts are growing exponentially, the White House has suggested that it may soon relax federal guidelines for social distancing and encourage businesses to reopen in order to stimulate the economy.5 The recent extension of social distancing guidelines from Easter to April 30 falls short of what epidemiologists project will be needed. The executive branch should convene governors and state directors of public health and exhort them to reach consensus on a coordinated set of community mitigation interventions and a timeline. Unified decision making would ensure that all governors have access to the best available evidence, provide political cover for those under pressure to minimize disruptions to their local economy, and replace competition among states for scarce medical resources with a sensible allocation framework.\nSecond, Congress could use its spending power to further encourage states to follow a uniform playbook for community mitigation that includes measures for effective enforcement of public health orders. It could create incentives for action by conditioning a portion of funds going to states in any future relief packages on states\u2019 adherence to the measures \u2014 a defensible step, from a constitutional standpoint, because the programmatic purpose of such funds is to make it feasible for states to shutter schools and businesses. It could also threaten to withhold some federal funds (e.g., for schools and highways) from states that do not comply, again on the basis that compliance is related to the federal goals of school safety and safe interstate travel.\nThird, Congress could leverage its interstate-commerce powers to regulate economic activities that affect the interstate spread of SARS-CoV-2. For example, it could restrict large businesses from having employees travel and from operating across state lines in ways that expose workers to risk (e.g., a shipping and delivery business that does not implement specified measures to provide employees with adequate personal protective equipment and paid sick leave could be declared a threat to public health).\nFederal emergency declarations also provide useful powers that can help unify a national response. In addition to the helpful steps already taken to approve state major-disaster declarations, waive health care regulatory requirements to facilitate timely care, and ease the path for laboratory-developed tests to be put to use, the government could further use the Defense Production Act to direct private companies to produce needed supplies, devote additional federal resources to purchasing and equitably distributing test kits, and take stronger steps to prevent the virus\u2019s spread in federal facilities, including immigration-detention centers and correctional facilities. Finally, the CDC can implement interstate travel restrictions for persons with known exposure to or symptoms of Covid-19.\nLearning is difficult in the midst of an emergency, but one lesson from the Covid-19 epidemic is already clear: when epidemiologists warn that a pathogen has pandemic potential, the time to fly the flag of local freedom is over. Yet national leadership in epidemic response works only if it is evidence-based. It is critical that the U.S. response to Covid-19 going forward be not only national, but also rational.\nDisclosure forms provided by the authors are available at NEJM.org.\nThis article was published on April 2, 2020, at NEJM.org.\nAuthor Affiliations\nFrom RAND, Boston (R.L.H.); the Department of Health Management and Policy, University of Michigan School of Public Health, Ann Arbor (R.L.H); and Stanford Law School and the Center for Health Policy/Primary Care and Outcomes Research, Department of Medicine, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA (M.M.M.).\nSupplementary Material\nDisclosure Forms PDF 75KB\nReferences (5)", "10.1056/NEJMp2007781": "2 References\nDr. Wakam: I\u2019m 5 hours into my ICU shift at a community hospital in Detroit when the results of another arterial blood gas return.

The results from the arterial blood gas are dismal: pH 7.19, pCO2 70.1, pO2 63.7, HCO3 26.0.

SIGN UP\nThe fear of dying alone is nearly universal \u2014 a fact of which anyone who\u2019s taken care of a critically ill patient is acutely aware. So we sometimes go to great lengths to give patients just a little more time for family members to arrive and say their goodbyes. One aspect of the Covid-19 pandemic that has been particularly difficult is that instead of our usual promise that \u201cWe\u2019ll do everything we can to keep him alive until you get here,\u201d we find ourselves telling families, \u201cBecause of hospital policy, we cannot allow visitors at this time.\u201d This conversation sometimes takes place at the doors to the ICU, over the phone, or in front of the hospital, as families beg to see their loved ones before they die. A seemingly simple request, which in other times would be encouraged, has become an ethical and health care dilemma.\nIt is 12 a.m., and I try to advocate for the wife with the nursing managers. To complicate matters, the wife admits that although she hasn\u2019t had any fever or cough, she has had a headache and a sore throat. With no clear policy in place for family members with symptoms, we call the hospital administrator at home, and he answers immediately: \u201cNo.\u201d Then there\u2019s a long back and forth about \u201cextenuating circumstances\u201d criteria, which allow a single visitor to come to the hospital. But since the wife could possibly have symptoms and has not been tested for Covid-19, the administrator decides she cannot visit. I telephone the wife and relay the final decision, and she rapidly cycles through stages of grief. Her initial anger and threats of a lawsuit quickly give way to pleading and bargaining \u2014 \u201cWhat if I only spent 5 minutes and left?\u201d\nThe problem is multifaceted. In many cases, family members have already spent time in close contact with the patient, which means they\u2019re reasonably likely to be infected with SARS-CoV-2 themselves. Moreover, there is a shortage of personal protective equipment (PPE), and using some on family members means consuming more of a scarce resource. And if the family members are currently uninfected, a visit to a ward full of patients with Covid-19 risks infecting people who lack proper training in PPE use.\nThis dilemma has led to some creative workarounds: nurses may hold the bedside phone up to the patient\u2019s ear or bring their personal smartphone into the room and hold it up while using Skype, WhatsApp, or FaceTime. But many nurses, owing to concern about HIPAA privacy rules, a heavy workload, or poor connectivity can\u2019t offer such communication with family. And even if a call does take place, families may be left feeling like they didn\u2019t get to say goodbye properly \u2014 and we are left feeling like there must be a better way.\nMy patient\u2019s wife arrives at the emergency department at 1:30 a.m., despite having been told she would not be allowed to see her husband. I go to meet her, and we discuss her husband\u2019s continued decline. Unfortunately, in the middle of the conversation, a Code Blue rings from the overhead speaker for a patient in the ICU. I step away and find myself entering her husband\u2019s room, where CPR is already in progress.\nAfter 90 minutes of CPR, epinephrine, and defibrillations, my patient still has not regained a sustained pulse. I somberly call time of death. One of the nurses in the hallway has been in contact with the wife throughout the process and has informed her of the death; she now has the wife on FaceTime so that she can see her husband. When she recognizes him in the distorted image, she lets out a wail of sorrow. She is in the midst of her final goodbyes when I have to excuse myself from the room: another patient with Covid-19 is deteriorating a few rooms over.\nWe, as residents, have spent much of our time these past few weeks in community ICUs around Detroit, one of the epicenters of Covid-19 in the United States, and have all experienced similar scenarios. We have witnessed more death in the past 3 weeks than in all our previous years combined. Unfortunately, similar stories are becoming more common and represent uncharted territory for many of us, as we try to maintain our humanity and patient-centeredness while managing these difficult situations.\nWe believe that the U.S. health care system can do better. As telehealth and virtual meetings become the new normal, so can telecommunication between isolated patients and their families. Perhaps setting up a tablet computer facing the patient or repurposing a workstation on wheels logged in to a video chat would be a solution. Recently, some guidance has become available regarding difficult but necessary conversations related to Covid-19 and ways of bridging the physical distance we must maintain during the pandemic.1,2 Such efforts may not represent the evidence-based medicine we all strive to practice, but they capture some of the art of caring not just for patients, but also for their families and friends. National guidance would be beneficial, since existing Covid-19 management resources fall short. There may be no way for families to hold patients\u2019 hands or hug them while they\u2019re dying, but with the care and compassion of frontline health care workers, maybe we can harness creative solutions to help them feel some connection, while still keeping everyone safe.\nDisclosure forms provided by the authors are available at NEJM.org.\nIdentifying details have been changed to protect the family\u2019s privacy.\nThis article was published on April 14, 2020, at NEJM.org.\nAuthor Affiliations\nFrom the Department of Surgery, University of Michigan , Ann Arbor.\nSupplementary Material\nDisclosure Forms PDF 105KB\nReferences (2)", "10.1056/NEJMp2005835": "5 References\n6 Citing Articles\nAudio Interview\nInterview with Dr. Judd Hollander on how health systems can use telemedicine services during the Covid-19 pandemic.

It seems clear that we need an immediate digital revolution to face this crisis.\nSign up for the Weekly Table of Contents email.\nEach week, receive an email with links to the articles published in the current week's issue of the New England Journal of Medicine. SIGN UP\nIn a very real sense, the spread of Covid-19 is a product of the digital and technological revolution that has transformed our world over the past century. Unlike the \u201cSpanish flu\u201d of 1918, which became an international epidemic over the course of a year, Covid-19 has spread to every inhabitable continent within weeks, outpacing our health system\u2019s ability to test, track, and contain people with suspected infection. To continue functioning, private companies and institutions of higher education have made an abrupt transition to remote videoconferencing and other digital solutions, while the health care system is still managing this crisis largely through risky brick-and-mortar visits.\nAs an analogue system, health care is ill equipped to cope with this swiftly emerging epidemic. The U.S. health care industry is structured on the historically necessary model of in-person interactions between patients and their clinicians. Clinical workflows and economic incentives have largely been developed to support and reinforce a face-to-face model of care, resulting in the congregation of patients in emergency departments and waiting areas during this crisis. This care structure contributes to the spread of the virus to uninfected patients who are seeking evaluation. Vulnerable populations such as patients with multiple chronic conditions or immunosuppression will face the difficult choice between risking iatrogenic Covid-19 exposure during a clinician visit and postponing needed care.\nAs health care systems nationwide brace for a surge of Covid-19 cases, urgent action is required to transform health care delivery and to scale up our systems by unleashing the power of digital technologies.1 Although some digital technologies, such as those used for telemedicine, have existed for decades, they have had poor penetration into the market because of heavy regulation and sparse supportive payment structures.2 In a 2019 Price Waterhouse Cooper survey, 38% of chief executive officers of U.S. health care systems reported having no digital component in their overall strategic plan; 94% of respondents pointed to data-protection and privacy regulations, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA, 1996), and the expansion of HIPAA rules and penalties under the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (HITECH) Act (2009), as factors limiting implementation of digital strategies.3\nWith the first emergency Covid-19 authorization, Congress lifted provisions that limited telemedicine services to rural areas, allowing the use of telemedicine services for all beneficiaries of fee-for-service Medicare.4 To enhance the technology infrastructure available to clinicians to support these visits, the Office of Civil Rights (OCR) at the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has announced that it is using its enforcement discretion and will not impose penalties for using HIPAA-noncompliant private communications technologies to provide telehealth services during this public health emergency.5 These are important initial responses, but the crisis demands a broader strategy to address three specific areas: reimbursement for new digital services, expanded regulatory relief, and evaluation of clinical care provided by means of these technologies.\nThe menu of new remote service options that health systems are rapidly attempting to adopt requires payment structures to support its growth. Beyond video visits, these services include text, email, and mobile-phone applications and can expand to include uses of wearable devices and \u201cchatbots.\u201d These services could be deployed to provide synchronous and asynchronous support both for patients with Covid-19 and for those requiring other routine clinical services. Reimbursement could be structured around time-based models or fixed fee-for-service payments. Evaluation and management (E&M) billing codes can be expanded beyond the existing telemedicine modifiers to reflect a more expansive conceptualization of digital service provision. For example, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) could remove requirements for in-person physical exams as part of E&M services, leaving determinations about the need for, and mode of, such exams to the discretion of the clinician.\nTechnical fees to support the required technology infrastructure can be developed on the basis of existing software-as-service models. Any relevant payment rules should allow for creative applications of emerging digital technologies, such as voice-interface systems (Amazon Alexa, Google Voice, Apple Siri) or mobile sensors such as smartwatches, oxygen monitors, or thermometers. Concurrently, the federal government could move to classify and regulate these digital services as activities of interstate commerce subject to federal rather than state jurisdiction, in order to provide a single set of rules for this emerging market.\nA second set of services is needed to expand our capacity for caring for patients who are acutely ill. Hospital-at-home models for infected patients have been well described, and payment approaches for these models have been proposed but never widely adopted. Hospital-at-home care will be an important option for otherwise stable patients with newly diagnosed SARS-CoV-2 infections and for early discharge of patients admitted to hospitals.\nAnother new category of service is oversight of persons under investigation in home quarantine. Physicians and health systems may need to track large populations of patients on a daily basis. Again, digital technology can support this service under new payment models \u2014 existing models for remote-monitoring services are personnel-intensive rather than technology-intensive and require approval of monitoring devices by the Food and Drug Administration; they could not be applied to patient surveys conducted by digital assistant. The HHS secretary and the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation (CMMI) have authority to enact such changes in the payment structure. CMS can ensure that the private market also adopts these provisions by, for example, leveraging participation requirements for Medicare Advantage.\nAn emergency update of privacy and communication regulation would have to accompany implementation of the payment models for these new digital services. Stringent and outdated technological requirements under HIPAA, coupled with confusing or vague regulatory guidance, have greatly slowed adoption of digital solutions in health care. Allowing for the use of secure technologies, such as commercial videoconferencing solutions that offer 256-bit end-to-end encryption \u2014 technologies that surpass anything that existed in 1996, when HIPAA was passed \u2014 will ensure security while expanding services. HHS\u2019s announced enforcement discretion recognizes the importance and timeliness of this issue.\nHHS could expand the impact of its approach by defining telehealth broadly to include digital tools beyond audio and video. To ensure that health care systems are aggressive in adopting these solutions, the agency could expand its enforcement discretion to any provider adopting a digital solution for patient care. Providers could document their technical solution in a memo to the OCR to allow HHS to build a record of these new approaches. When such a notice was filed, the implemented solution could be considered compliant for 24 months, the duration of the emergency, or until the provider receives further updates from HHS. Over the next several months, HHS can change HIPAA to allow the use of commercial encrypted technologies for telehealth services as a permanent solution.\nThe final part of this policy response should include a provision for evaluating these emergency measures. There has long been a debate in the United States about the risk of fraud resulting from adoption of digital services in health care. Obviously, it will be important for us to understand whether these new authorizations were used appropriately by providers and patients, and to assess the quality of care provided. At the same time, there has been an ongoing quest to adopt digital technologies to improve the quality and reduce the cost of health care services. It will also be important to understand whether these new approaches help to increase clinical productivity during the Covid-19 pandemic. Such information will be critical to understanding whether these emergency authorizations should be made permanent once the immediate crisis has resolved.\nFortunately, the world is a different place than it was in 1918. We have the technology to strengthen our health care system for our patients. It\u2019s time we put these tools into practice.\nDisclosure forms provided by the authors are available at NEJM.org.\nThis article was published on April 2, 2020, at NEJM.org.\nAuthor Affiliations\nFrom the Clinical Excellence Research Center, Stanford University School of Medicine (S.K., A.J., K.S.), and the Stanford University Graduate School of Business (K.S.) \u2014 both in Stanford, CA.\nSupplementary Material\nDisclosure Forms PDF 111KB\nReferences (5)\nCiting Articles (6)", "10.1056/NEJMp2005638": "5 References\n1 Citing Article\nAs Covid-19 spreads throughout the United States, schools and child care facilities are balancing their role of helping to prevent disease transmission with ensuring access to food for children who rely on the federal nutrition safety net. Together, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) National School Lunch Program, School Breakfast Program, and Child and Adult Care Food Program serve nearly 35 million children daily, delivering vital nutrition and financial assistance to families in need.1 With such programs interrupted, an essential element of the Covid-19 response will be feeding children from low-income families.\nMeals and snacks from schools or child care centers fulfill up to two thirds of children\u2019s daily nutritional needs and are generally healthier than those brought from home. The short-term health effects of missed meals include fatigue and reduced immune response, which increase the risk of contracting communicable diseases. Even brief periods of food insecurity can cause long-term developmental, psychological, physical, and emotional harms. Children from low-income households, who are already at higher risk for poorer health and academic performance than children from high-income households, may be further disadvantaged by nutrition shortfalls.\nSign up for the Weekly Table of Contents email.\nEach week, receive an email with links to the articles published in the current week's issue of the New England Journal of Medicine. SIGN UP\nLost access to school meals also highlights the fragile financial health of families in the federal nutrition safety net. When schools and child care centers close, children miss out on food services worth at least $30 per week.2 The true cost to families of feeding children is probably higher, because this figure doesn\u2019t account for time spent purchasing or preparing foods or the higher price of retail foods as compared with schools\u2019 bulk-purchasing rates. Increased food-related financial burdens can harm all household members by forcing families to ration food or forgo other critical needs, such as medication, utilities, and rent.\nThe current situation is unprecedented, and it\u2019s unclear how long school closures will last. The USDA hasn\u2019t mandated that schools offer food service during closures. Instead, local education authorities (such as school superintendents and school boards) are being permitted to apply approaches from the USDA\u2019s summer feeding programs and have been \u201cencouraged to ensure that the needs of low-income children are met during extended school dismissals.\u201d3 However, many schools lack experience with summer feeding initiatives, which reach only one in seven children who usually receive free or reduced-price meals during the school year,4 and summer programs don\u2019t follow the same strict nutritional standards as school breakfast and lunch programs. The USDA has begun releasing national waivers for mealtime and congregant meal-setting requirements, allowing schools to adopt innovative approaches to providing meals and to practice appropriate social distancing.\nAs federal guidance emerges, several states and schools are developing their own solutions, adapting traditional service models to reduce disease transmission. For example, the Department of Education in South Carolina (where more than 15% of the population lives in rural areas) announced \u201cGrab-n-Go\u201d meal sites throughout the state that can provide up to 5 days of meals at once. Several districts in Michigan and New York are arranging meal deliveries to school bus stops or homes. The USDA has also initiated a public\u2013private partnership in rural areas to deliver shelf-stable food packages that include food that children can prepare independently, though the program\u2019s reach is limited. Although such approaches are innovative, it\u2019s unclear whether they can ensure that food is distributed effectively and equitably while preventing disease transmission, and it remains to be seen which programs will prove cost-effective and sustainable for the duration of school closures.\nGiven geographic diversity and variation in Covid-19 prevalence, solutions for feeding children who usually participate in federal nutrition programs will need to be flexible, tailored, and thoughtful \u2014 so as not to stigmatize children for receiving emergency meals, which might discourage participation. Federal guidance on best practices for handling meals to reduce viral spread is also needed. We currently don\u2019t know which models for food delivery are most in line with social-distancing recommendations or easily activated and scaled. This guidance is critical for local decision making as the number and duration of school closures increase.\nGuidelines for the Child and Adult Care Food Program, which reaches 4.3 million children daily,1 are even less detailed. Under this program, child care providers often prepare food themselves and probably can\u2019t operate a food service if their facilities are closed. Districts and child care centers are essentially having to \u201cbuild the plane while they fly it.\u201d Missteps can have serious nutritional and health implications for millions of children.\nRecent legislative efforts may help address the challenges associated with feeding children, although additional steps will surely be needed. President Donald Trump declared a national emergency under the Stafford Act, thereby authorizing federal aid to state and local governments. These funds could be used to expand access to food assistance, but the bulk of aid appears to be directed toward waiving regulations that hamper access to health care (e.g., additional support for hiring more emergency workers or obtaining medical supplies and vaccine).\nThe Families First Coronavirus Response Act, which was signed into law on March 18 and authorizes $100 billion in relief, includes explicit provisions for nutrition assistance. The legislation allows states to request waivers for providing temporary, emergency benefits under the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) to households already enrolled in the program with children who would normally receive free or reduced-price meals, up to the maximum monthly allotment of $646 for a family of four. Pilot tested in summer months \u2014 when many children lose access to school meals \u2014 this approach has reduced severe food insecurity.5 However, results from pilot tests are preliminary, and the program hasn\u2019t been scaled up and may fall short of reaching many children affected by Covid-19. For example, children don\u2019t qualify if they are served by the Child and Adult Care Food Program or if they are undocumented immigrants whose families don\u2019t qualify for SNAP but rely on school meals.\nThe shift in responsibility for feeding children from the National School Lunch Program and School Breakfast Program to SNAP may also have negative health implications. School meals are required to align with the latest nutrition science (although the USDA may waive meal-pattern requirements if the food supply is disrupted). By contrast, SNAP places few limits on allowable purchases, so relying more heavily on this program may inadequately address children\u2019s nutritional needs. This shift may also lead to increased weight gain, particularly among racial and ethnic minorities and overweight children, since there is evidence that these children tend to gain weight more quickly during the summer than during the school year.\nOn March 27, Trump also signed into law the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act, which includes a $15.8 billion appropriation for SNAP and $8.8 billion for child nutrition programs. Increases in SNAP funding will not expand eligibility or increase benefit size; instead, funding will cover anticipated surges in administrative and benefit costs resulting from increased unemployment.\nThe Covid-19 pandemic highlights the need for policy-based solutions that ensure food security for millions of American children. Whereas means-tested programs such as SNAP have traditionally received bipartisan support, recent efforts to protect access to this program have been met with substantial partisan opposition. The current situation is made more tenuous by proposed changes to SNAP that could reduce or eliminate benefits for more than 1 million households with children, such as a proposed rule to limit broad-based categorical eligibility. In addition, changes to the \u201cpublic charge\u201d rule went into effect in February 2020. These changes could now deny a path to citizenship for people who use public benefits such as SNAP, which will probably discourage documented immigrant families from obtaining access to emergency provisions, leaving them increasingly vulnerable during the Covid-19 pandemic. Short-term policy solutions may help address immediate issues of food insecurity resulting from loss of access to meals provided by schools or child care centers. Unfortunately, broader policies that discourage enrollment or reduce access to nutrition-assistance programs have undermined our response to Covid-19.\nAs we grapple with Covid-19, it\u2019s critical to ensure that the nutritional needs of vulnerable children are met in order to avoid exacerbating disparities in health and educational attainment for years to come (see box for preliminary suggestions). We should examine in real time the strategies being used, acknowledge the broader political landscape in which they\u2019re being implemented, and improve our ability to adapt how, when, and where we provide nutritional support to children.\nPRELIMINARY SUGGESTED APPROACHES TO ADDRESSING FOOD INSECURITY IN U.S. CHILDREN\nDURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC.\nCentralize and widely distribute information about schools and school districts offering meals during school closure\nDecrease social exposures and reduce the time and transportation burden for families by providing multiple days\u2019 worth of meals, allowing for drive-through meal pickup (when reasonable), or coordinating meal delivery\nExtend emergency benefits to caregivers of children in child care facilities participating in the Child and Adult Care Food Program, and authorize use into periods beyond the Covid-19 response, such as summer months or other emergencies\nCodify efforts to expand Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program access and benefits during future pandemics\nExamine and amend policies that reduce or deter participation in the nutrition safety net (e.g., the public charge rule)\nDisclosure forms provided by the authors are available at NEJM.org.\nThis article was published on March 30, 2020, at NEJM.org.\nAuthor Affiliations\nFrom the Departments of Health Policy and Management (C.G.D., S.N.B.) and Nutrition (E.K.), Harvard T.H.

Several aspects of the U.S. response raise serious concerns, highlighting how the processes for evaluating and approving drugs can go awry during a public health crisis.\nThe global pandemic has put pressure on clinicians and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to act swiftly to make medications available to patients. When very limited observational and anecdotal evidence raised the possibility that the antimalarial drugs chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine may have activity against SARS-CoV-2, President Donald Trump quickly began celebrating the promise of their widespread use, stating on national television that he had a \u201chunch\u201d that such therapy was effective and that the drugs could be a \u201cgame changer\u201d in addressing the pandemic. More recently, he openly encouraged patients to take the drugs and suggested he might do so himself, despite having tested negative for the virus.\nSign up for the Weekly Table of Contents email.\nEach week, receive an email with links to the articles published in the current week's issue of the New England Journal of Medicine. SIGN UP\nAfter Trump\u2019s initial assertions, the FDA \u2014 still facing criticism that its delays in approving testing kits for the virus hindered prevention efforts \u2014 issued an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) on March 28 that allowed for use of the drugs to treat patients with Covid-19. Although the EUA\u2019s scope was limited to permitting distribution of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine from a federal stockpile, its issuance was widely yet incorrectly reported by Trump and others as meaning that the FDA had approved the drugs for this indication. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) went so far as to publish doses of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine for use in patients with Covid-19, though it later removed them from its website. Meanwhile, serious concerns have been raised about the adequacy of the available studies of these drugs.1\nThese developments represent fundamental threats to the U.S. drug-evaluation process. Advocating that the FDA should quickly approve drugs without randomized trial data runs counter to the idea of evidence-based medicine and risks further undermining the public\u2019s understanding of and faith in the drug-review process, which requires \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d of safety and efficacy based on adequate and well-controlled trials before a drug can be marketed. Though this unprecedented emergency provides a compelling reason for the FDA to act as efficiently as possible, the agency and the medical community can still maintain the highest scientific standards while acting expeditiously.\nThe new EUA represents only the second time the FDA has ever used emergency authority to permit use of a medication for an unapproved indication. During the 2009\u20132010 \u201cswine flu\u201d outbreak, the agency allowed use of peramivir \u2014 an investigational intravenous neuraminidase inhibitor \u2014 in severely ill hospitalized patients with H1N1 influenza. Under that EUA, peramivir was administered to some 1200 to 1500 patients, with no rigorous tracking of which patients received it or collection of outcome data.2 Ultimately, a randomized, controlled trial failed to show any benefit of peramivir as compared with placebo in severely ill hospitalized patients with influenza; the drug was approved in 2014 with an indication only for uncomplicated influenza and not for use in severely ill hospitalized patients.\nHydroxychloroquine is already marketed for other conditions, so physicians were allowed to prescribe it off-label to patients with Covid-19 even before the EUA or CDC dose recommendations were issued. In addition, for investigational drugs that are not yet marketed, providers can request \u201cexpanded access\u201d for severely ill patients who lack alternative treatment options and are not eligible for clinical trials \u2014 permission the FDA nearly always grants. This option has already been used for remdesivir, an investigational antiviral drug whose manufacturer has provided it to more than a thousand patients with Covid-19 outside clinical trials.\nEven before the pandemic, many conservative and libertarian politicians and advocacy groups supported expanding patients\u2019 \u201cright to try\u201d unapproved experimental drugs. This position has intensified a commonly held but spurious belief that slow processes and overly onerous requirements by the FDA prevent patients from accessing many clinically useful drugs. In fact, the FDA presides over one of the fastest drug approval processes in the world, with a majority of drugs gaining approval in the United States before they are approved in Europe or Canada.3 The FDA approves the overwhelming majority of drug applications it receives, and over the past several decades it has been approving more drugs on the basis of limited evidence, such as fewer clinical trials per drug, trials with suboptimal design, and trials using surrogate measures \u2014 which may or may not predict actual clinical benefit \u2014 as end points.4\nWidening access to experimental therapies that have not been fully evaluated is likely to have several unintended consequences. First, benefits to patients are unknown and may be negligible (as in the case of peramivir), in which case expanded access undermines physicians\u2019 attempts to practice evidence-based medicine. Second, medications such as hydroxychloroquine have well-documented risks; subjecting patients to these risks would be unjustifiable in the absence of meaningful clinical benefit. Third, distributing unproven drugs under expanded access or EUAs may detract from the resources needed to carry out clinical trials, including the patient base and necessary funds. Since key outcome data are often not collected outside a trial, this redirection of resources will hamper our ability to quickly determine whether these drugs are truly safe and effective.\nFinally, with drugs that are already marketed for other conditions, widespread off-label use can limit access for patients who need them for their established use. After Trump promoted hydroxychloroquine, prescribing of the drug increased rapidly, leading to substantial shortages affecting patients taking it for rheumatoid arthritis or lupus \u2014 indications for which it has been proven effective.\nDuring a pandemic that is causing morbidity and mortality to grow exponentially, there is an understandable temptation to make unproven therapies widely available and not wait for rigorous clinical trial data. However, well-conducted randomized, controlled trials in these acutely ill patients can actually be carried out quite rapidly. Thousands of new patients with Covid-19 present for care each day, and many can be (and are) quickly enrolled in pragmatic clinical trials. The most relevant clinical outcomes for evaluating these drugs \u2014 including death, hospitalization, number of days spent in intensive care, and need for a ventilator \u2014 are readily assessed and available within days or weeks.\nAt least 25 drugs are under investigation for use in Covid-19, with 10 in active clinical trials. The first published major randomized, controlled trial of an antiviral drug combination (lopinavir\u2013ritonavir) began enrolling patients in China just a week after the virus had been identified.5 Contrary to expectations, its results were negative, providing important clinical guidance.\nIf data emerge showing that any regimen is truly effective in treating Covid-19, the FDA should be able to review those data and provide an approval decision within days or weeks. The agency has already established a Coronavirus Treatment Acceleration Program to assist manufacturers in navigating administrative requirements and to expedite the review process.\nAdequate clinical trials will soon confirm or refute the usefulness of several candidate drugs in treating Covid-19. But the weeks leading up to provision of that evidence reveal a great deal about threats to our approach to evaluating medications. Issues such as inadequate trial design, overreaching public declarations, and widespread use of unproven treatments will continue to present themselves during this pandemic and beyond.\nRigorous premarketing evaluation of drugs\u2019 safety and effectiveness in randomized, controlled trials remains our primary tool for protecting the public from drugs that are ineffective, unsafe, or both. It is a false dichotomy to suggest that we must choose between rapid deployment of treatments and adequate scientific scrutiny. For the Covid-19 pandemic and other pressing medical challenges, the health of individual patients and the public at large will be best served by remaining true to our time-tested approach to clinical trial evidence and drug evaluation, rather than cutting corners and resorting to appealing yet risky quick fixes. The pandemic will inevitably leave considerable morbidity, mortality, and loss in its wake. Damage to the country\u2019s medication-assessment process \u2014 and the public\u2019s respect for it \u2014 should not be part of its legacy.\nDisclosure forms provided by the authors are available at NEJM.org.\nThis article was published on April 14, 2020, at NEJM.org.\nAuthor Affiliations\nFrom the Program On Regulation, Therapeutics, And Law (PORTAL), Division of Pharmacoepidemiology and Pharmacoeconomics, Department of Medicine, Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston.\nSupplementary Material\nDisclosure Forms PDF 75KB\nReferences (5)", "10.1056/NEJMp2008193": "5 References\nIn South Sudan, all schools and churches have been closed to promote social distancing.

The coronavirus is coming to Africa, and with creative actions, large and small, Africans are aiming to meet it head on.\nAs the Covid-19 pandemic sweeps the globe, causing tens of thousands of deaths and massive economic disruption, Africa has so far been largely spared the kind of impact that has thrown China, the United States, and Europe into chaos. As of April 13, there were about 14,000 confirmed cases on the African continent, as compared with 160,000 in Italy and more than 560,000 in the United States.1,2 But rather than inviting relief or complacency, the numbers from Africa are like the early drops of rain before the clouds open up. Despite the slow arrival of Covid-19, a storm is building, and the 1.2 billion people living in Africa are at tremendous risk.\nSign up for the Weekly Table of Contents email.\nEach week, receive an email with links to the articles published in the current week's issue of the New England Journal of Medicine. SIGN UP\nMost African countries remain woefully unprepared for what\u2019s coming. Kenya, for example, has only 200 intensive care beds for its entire population of 50 million. Compare that to the United States, which has 34 beds for every 100,000 people.3 Countries from Mali to Liberia have only a few ventilators for millions of people. In urban communities throughout Africa, health facilities tend to be overcrowded and understaffed, while in rural areas, poor roads and unreliable transport make it difficult for people to access care. Advanced health care is sorely lacking in nearly every country.\nBut the obstacles are not limited to care and treatment of people who are sick. In many communities, people live together in close quarters, which makes social distancing, a critical prevention strategy, more difficult. Millions of people live without access to clean running water, which makes frequent handwashing all but impossible.4 Adding to these concerns, winter is coming to the Southern Hemisphere, where most of Africa lies, and some experts worry that drier, colder weather may increase viral activity.\nConfronting epidemics is not new to Africans, and their experience may prove to be an advantage. Responding to infectious diseases for generations has sensitized governments and communities to the dangers and to the need for rapid, proactive measures to save lives. Moreover, a substantial number of countries in Africa have benefited from previous global initiatives to strengthen health systems to address HIV, malaria, tuberculosis, and Ebola.5 In addition, the Africa Centers for Disease Control has accelerated its work to enhance diagnostic and surveillance capacity on the continent. As a result, health infrastructures are less fragile than they have been in the past.\nThe biggest advantage, of course, is time. Heads of state, ministries of health, hospitals, clinics, and community health organizations are taking immediate action. As the pandemic makes its first inroads, several countries have vigorously pursued containment efforts involving identifying, assessing, and isolating people with suspected cases and close contacts of each infected person. Countries are also mobilizing virtual learning networks to disseminate information to health and community workers. From Angola to Zimbabwe, governments are putting in place mitigation measures by closing borders, shuttering markets, suspending internal flights, and instituting limits or outright bans on social gatherings.\nBut despite these intensive preparations, we should have no illusions that Africa can confront this threat alone. Coordinated global support is essential in the face of the Covid-19 pandemic, and the time to act is now. We believe that during the next few weeks, countries around the world should take concrete steps to assist Africa in staying ahead of the curve, even as they confront their own epidemics. These steps may include donations of coronavirus test kits, personal protective equipment, ventilators, and other life-support equipment or, at a minimum, ensuring that African countries are not priced out of the market for these commodities. Support is urgently needed for real-time Covid-19 surveillance systems and for surveys to determine the scope of the epidemic and to inform decisions about how to respond. Funding and technical support are also needed to run national information campaigns to promote safe behaviors and to counter the stigma that often arises against the people thought to be causing the epidemic. Vulnerable populations, particularly the poor and people engaged in the informal economy, will need to be supported during periods when movement of people is restricted. Finally, it is critically important that resources and attention not be diverted from the continent\u2019s ongoing threats from other infectious diseases, such as HIV, tuberculosis, and malaria.\nWhen HIV spread like wildfire across the African continent, it took decades for the world to mobilize a response. Tens of millions of people were infected and many millions died as the epidemic took root \u2014 and it persists to this day. Epidemics know no borders, and success in controlling the epidemic in any one country will be limited if epidemics continue to rage elsewhere. Today, we have the chance to avoid a repeat of history.

Health care providers have an important role in addressing these emotional outcomes as part of the pandemic response.\nPublic health emergencies may affect the health, safety, and well-being of both individuals (causing, for example, insecurity, confusion, emotional isolation, and stigma) and communities (owing to economic loss, work and school closures, inadequate resources for medical response, and deficient distribution of necessities). These effects may translate into a range of emotional reactions (such as distress or psychiatric conditions), unhealthy behaviors (such as excessive substance use), and noncompliance with public health directives (such as home confinement and vaccination) in people who contract the disease and in the general population. Extensive research in disaster mental health has established that emotional distress is ubiquitous in affected populations \u2014 a finding certain to be echoed in populations affected by the Covid-19 pandemic.\nSign up for the Weekly Table of Contents email.\nEach week, receive an email with links to the articles published in the current week's issue of the New England Journal of Medicine. SIGN UP\nAfter disasters, most people are resilient and do not succumb to psychopathology. Indeed, some people find new strengths. Nevertheless, in \u201cconventional\u201d natural disasters, technological accidents, and intentional acts of mass destruction, a primary concern is post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) arising from exposure to trauma. Medical conditions from natural causes such as life-threatening viral infection do not meet the current criteria for trauma required for a diagnosis of PTSD,1 but other psychopathology, such as depressive and anxiety disorders, may ensue.\nSome groups may be more vulnerable than others to the psychosocial effects of pandemics. In particular, people who contract the disease, those at heightened risk for it (including the elderly, people with compromised immune function, and those living or receiving care in congregate settings), and people with preexisting medical, psychiatric, or substance use problems are at increased risk for adverse psychosocial outcomes. Health care providers are also particularly vulnerable to emotional distress in the current pandemic, given their risk of exposure to the virus, concern about infecting and caring for their loved ones, shortages of personal protective equipment (PPE), longer work hours, and involvement in emotionally and ethically fraught resource-allocation decisions. Prevention efforts such as screening for mental health problems, psychoeducation, and psychosocial support should focus on these and other groups at risk for adverse psychosocial outcomes.\nBeyond stresses inherent in the illness itself, mass home-confinement directives (including stay-at-home orders, quarantine, and isolation) are new to Americans and raise concern about how people will react individually and collectively. A recent review of psychological sequelae in samples of quarantined people and of health care providers may be instructive; it revealed numerous emotional outcomes, including stress, depression, irritability, insomnia, fear, confusion, anger, frustration, boredom, and stigma associated with quarantine, some of which persisted after the quarantine was lifted. Specific stressors included greater duration of confinement, having inadequate supplies, difficulty securing medical care and medications, and resulting financial losses.2 In the current pandemic, the home confinement of large swaths of the population for indefinite periods, differences among the stay-at-home orders issued by various jurisdictions, and conflicting messages from government and public health authorities will most likely intensify distress. A study conducted in communities affected by severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in the early 2000s revealed that although community members, affected individuals, and health care workers were motivated to comply with quarantine to reduce the risk of infecting others and to protect the community\u2019s health, emotional distress tempted some to consider violating their orders.3\nOpportunities to monitor psychosocial needs and deliver support during direct patient encounters in clinical practice are greatly curtailed in this crisis by large-scale home confinement. Psychosocial services, which are increasingly delivered in primary care settings, are being offered by means of telemedicine. In the context of Covid-19, psychosocial assessment and monitoring should include queries about Covid-19\u2013related stressors (such as exposures to infected sources, infected family members, loss of loved ones, and physical distancing), secondary adversities (economic loss, for example), psychosocial effects (such as depression, anxiety, psychosomatic preoccupations, insomnia, increased substance use, and domestic violence), and indicators of vulnerability (such as preexisting physical or psychological conditions). Some patients will need referral for formal mental health evaluation and care, while others may benefit from supportive interventions designed to promote wellness and enhance coping (such as psychoeducation or cognitive behavioral techniques). In light of the widening economic crisis and numerous uncertainties surrounding this pandemic, suicidal ideation may emerge and necessitate immediate consultation with a mental health professional or referral for possible emergency psychiatric hospitalization.\nOn the milder end of the psychosocial spectrum, many of the experiences of patients, family members, and the public can be appropriately normalized by providing information about usual reactions to this kind of stress and by pointing out that people can and do manage even in the midst of dire circumstances. Health care providers can offer suggestions for stress management and coping (such as structuring activities and maintaining routines), link patients to social and mental health services, and counsel patients to seek professional mental health assistance when needed. Since media reports can be emotionally disturbing, contact with pandemic-related news should be monitored and limited. Because parents commonly underestimate their children\u2019s distress, open discussions should be encouraged to address children\u2019s reactions and concerns.\nAs for health care providers themselves, the novel nature of SARS-CoV-2, inadequate testing, limited treatment options, insufficient PPE and other medical supplies, extended workloads, and other emerging concerns are sources of stress and have the potential to overwhelm systems. Self-care for providers, including mental health care providers, involves being informed about the illness and risks, monitoring one\u2019s own stress reactions, and seeking appropriate assistance with personal and professional responsibilities and concerns \u2014 including professional mental health intervention if indicated. Health care systems will need to address the stress on individual providers and on general operations by monitoring reactions and performance, altering assignments and schedules, modifying expectations, and creating mechanisms to offer psychosocial support as needed.\nGiven that most Covid-19 cases will be identified and treated in health care settings by workers with little to no mental health training, it is imperative that assessment and intervention for psychosocial concerns be administered in those settings. Ideally, the integration of mental health considerations into Covid-19 care will be addressed at the organizational level through state and local planning; mechanisms for identifying, referring, and treating severe psychosocial consequences; and ensuring the capacity for consulting with specialists.4\nEducation and training regarding psychosocial issues should be provided to health system leaders, first responders, and health care professionals. The mental health and emergency management communities should work together to identify, develop, and disseminate evidence-based resources related to disaster mental health, mental health triage and referral, needs of special populations, and death notification and bereavement care. Risk-communication efforts should anticipate the complexities of emerging issues such as prevention directives, vaccine availability and acceptability, and needed evidence-based interventions relevant to pandemics and should address a range of psychosocial concerns. Mental health professionals can help craft messages to be delivered by trusted leaders.4\nThe Covid-19 pandemic has alarming implications for individual and collective health and emotional and social functioning. In addition to providing medical care, already stretched health care providers have an important role in monitoring psychosocial needs and delivering psychosocial support to their patients, health care providers, and the public \u2014 activities that should be integrated into general pandemic health care.\nDisclosure forms provided by the authors are available at NEJM.org.\nThis article was published on April 13, 2020, at NEJM.org.\nAuthor Affiliations\nFrom the Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, College of Medicine, University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center, Oklahoma City (B.P.); and the Altshuler Center for Education and Research, Metrocare Services, and the Division of Trauma and Disaster, Department of Psychiatry, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center \u2014 both in Dallas (C.S.N.).\nSupplementary Material\nDisclosure Forms PDF 158KB\nReferences (4)", "10.1056/NEJMp2004361": "5 References\n9 Citing Articles\nInteractive Graphic\nImages from Infectious Disease Outbreaks\nWriting in the heady days of new antibiotics and immunizations, esteemed microbiologists Macfarlane Burnet and David White predicted in 1972 that \u201cthe most likely forecast about the future of infectious diseases is that it will be very dull.\u201d1 They acknowledged that there was always a risk of \u201csome wholly unexpected emergence of a new and dangerous infectious disease, but nothing of the sort has marked the last fifty years.\u201d Epidemics, it seemed, were of interest only to historians.\nSign up for the Weekly Table of Contents email.\nEach week, receive an email with links to the articles published in the current week's issue of the New England Journal of Medicine. SIGN UP\nTimes have changed. From herpes and legionnaires\u2019 disease in the 1970s, to AIDS, Ebola, the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), and now Covid-19, contagious diseases continue to threaten and disrupt human populations. Historians, who never lost interest in epidemics, have much to offer.\nWhen asked to explain past events, historians are quick to assert the importance of context. If you want to understand how or why something happened, you must attend to local circumstances. But there is something about epidemics that has elicited an opposite reaction from historians: a desire to identify universal truths about how societies respond to contagious disease.\nCharles Rosenberg, for instance, found inspiration in Albert Camus\u2019s La Peste and crafted an account of the archetypal structure of an outbreak.2 Epidemics unfold as social dramas in three acts, according to Rosenberg. The earliest signs are subtle. Whether influenced by a desire for self-reassurance or a need to protect economic interests, citizens ignore clues that something is awry until the acceleration of illness and deaths forces reluctant acknowledgment.\nRecognition launches the second act, in which people demand and offer explanations, both mechanistic and moral. Explanations, in turn, generate public responses. These can make the third act as dramatic and disruptive as the disease itself.\nEpidemics eventually resolve, whether succumbing to societal action or having exhausted the supply of susceptible victims. As Rosenberg put it, \u201cEpidemics start at a moment in time, proceed on a stage limited in space and duration, follow a plot line of increasing revelatory tension, move to a crisis of individual and collective character, then drift toward closure.\u201d This drama is now playing out with Covid-19, first in China and then in many countries worldwide.\nBut historians have not limited themselves to description. Rosenberg argued that epidemics put pressure on the societies they strike. This strain makes visible latent structures that might not otherwise be evident. As a result, epidemics provide a sampling device for social analysis. They reveal what really matters to a population and whom they truly value.\nOne dramatic aspect of epidemic response is the desire to assign responsibility. From Jews in medieval Europe to meat mongers in Chinese markets, someone is always blamed. This discourse of blame exploits existing social divisions of religion, race, ethnicity, class, or gender identity. Governments then respond by deploying their authority, with quarantine or compulsory vaccination, for instance. This step generally involves people with power and privilege imposing interventions on people without power or privilege, a dynamic that fuels social conflict.\nAnother recurring theme in historical analyses of epidemics is that medical and public health interventions often fail to live up to their promise. The technology needed to eradicate smallpox \u2014 vaccination \u2014 was described in 1798, but it took nearly 180 years to achieve success. In 1900, health officials in San Francisco strung a rope around Chinatown in an attempt to contain an outbreak of bubonic plague; only white people (and presumably rats) were allowed to enter or leave the neighborhood. This intervention did not have the desired effect.\nSyphilis, one of the great scourges of the early 20th century, could have been ended, in theory, had everyone adhered to a strict regimen of abstinence or monogamy. But as one U.S. Army medical officer complained in 1943, \u201cThe sex act cannot be made unpopular.\u201d3 When penicillin became available, syphilis could have been eradicated more easily, but some doctors cautioned against its use for fear that it would remove the penalty from promiscuity. The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) could, in theory, have been contained in the 1980s, but it wasn\u2019t \u2014 and though the advent of effective antiretroviral therapy in 1996 dramatically reduced AIDS-related mortality, it did not end it. Striking disparities in AIDS outcomes persist, following familiar lines of race, class, and gender. As historian Allan Brandt famously concluded, \u201cthe promise of the magic bullet has never been fulfilled.\u201d3\nAn Emergency Hospital in Brookline, Massachusetts, Where Patients Were Cared for during the 1918 Influenza Epidemic.\nGiven what historians have learned about past epidemics, it\u2019s hard not to be jaded now. This particular coronavirus may be new, but we have seen it all before (see slide show at NEJM.org). A novel pathogen emerged in China? That\u2019s no surprise: China has given rise to many past pandemics. People were slow to recognize the threat? That dynamic is what Camus described so well. Officials tried to suppress early warnings? Of course. Governments have reacted with authoritarian interventions? They often do \u2014 though the scale of China\u2019s interventions may be unprecedented. A quarantine fails to contain the pathogen? That has happened more often than not, especially with pathogens like influenza virus and SARS-CoV-2 that render people contagious before they\u2019re symptomatic. This does not mean that interventions are futile. When influenza struck the United States in 1918, different cities responded in different ways. Some were able to learn from the mistakes of those that had been hit first. Cities that implemented stringent controls, including school closures, bans on public gathering, and other forms of isolation or quarantine, slowed the course of the epidemic and reduced total mortality.4 China\u2019s aggressive response may have delayed the global spread of the current outbreak.\nTwo familiar aspects of the response to epidemics are especially disheartening. First, stigmatization follows closely on the heels of every pathogen. Anti-Chinese hostility has been a recurrent problem, whether with plague in San Francisco in 1900, SARS in 2003, or Covid-19 today. Second, epidemics too often claim the lives of health care providers. Physicians died during plague outbreaks in medieval Europe, during a yellow fever outbreak in Philadelphia in 1793, during the Ebola epidemic in 2014, and in China now. Though such mortality reflects the willingness of health professionals to put themselves at risk to care for others, it can also indict governments that ask clinicians to confront outbreaks without the \u201cstaff, stuff, space, and systems\u201d they need to be successful and safe.5\nWhereas historians excel at documenting the drama of past epidemics, they are less comfortable with prediction. How worried should we be about Covid-19? Some experts warn that half the world\u2019s population will be infected by year\u2019s end, an incidence that could result in more than 100 million deaths. History certainly provides a litany of epidemics, of plague, smallpox, measles, cholera, influenza, Marburg virus disease, and the Middle East respiratory syndrome. But catastrophic epidemics that kill millions have been exceedingly unusual, with just a few occurring over the past millennium. Are we now in one of those rare moments, facing a pathogen with just the right (wrong?) mix of contagiousness and virulence, with societies providing the requisite human\u2013animal contact, urban crowding, global travel, and populations stressed by growing social inequality? Given the historical rarity of catastrophic epidemics, such a perfect storm must be unlikely. But it is, regrettably, a possibility.\nHistory suggests that we are actually at much greater risk of exaggerated fears and misplaced priorities. There are many historical examples of panic about epidemics that never materialized (e.g., H1N1 influenza in 1976, 2006, and 2009). There are countless other examples of societies worrying about a small threat (e.g., the risk of Ebola spreading in the United States in 2014) while ignoring much larger ones hidden in plain sight. SARS-CoV-2 had killed roughly 5000 people by March 12. That is a fraction of influenza\u2019s annual toll. While the Covid-19 epidemic has unfolded, China has probably lost 5000 people each day to ischemic heart disease. So why do so many Americans refuse influenza vaccines? Why did China shut down its economy to contain Covid-19 while doing little to curb cigarette use? Societies and their citizens misunderstand the relative importance of the health risks they face. The future course of Covid-19 remains unclear (and I may rue these words by year\u2019s end). Nonetheless, citizens and their leaders need to think carefully, weigh risks in context, and pursue policies commensurate with the magnitude of the threat.\nWhich raises one last question of history and political leadership. A \u201cswine flu\u201d scare struck the United States in 1976 in the midst of a presidential campaign. Gerald Ford reacted aggressively and endorsed mass immunization. When people fell ill or died after receiving the vaccine, and when the feared pandemic never materialized, Ford\u2019s plan backfired and may have contributed to his defeat that November. When AIDS struck in 1981, Ronald Reagan ignored the epidemic throughout his entire first term. Yet he won reelection in a landslide. The current administration, thankfully, has not followed Reagan\u2019s lead. Will it succeed where Ford went awry? Initial assessments of the U.S. government\u2019s response have been mixed. The history of epidemics offers considerable advice, but only if people know the history and respond with wisdom.\nDisclosure forms provided by the author are available at NEJM.org.\nThis article was published on March 12, 2020, at NEJM.org.\nAuthor Affiliations\nFrom the Department of Global Health and Social Medicine, Harvard Medical School, Boston, and the Department of the History of Science, Harvard University, Cambridge, MA.\nSupplementary Material\nDisclosure Forms PDF 50KB\nReferences (5)\nCiting Articles (9)", "10.1056/NEJMp2004211": "5 References\n8 Citing Articles\nAs Covid-19 spreads around the globe, governments have imposed quarantines and travel bans on an unprecedented scale. China locked down whole cities, and Italy has imposed draconian restrictions throughout the country. In the United States, thousands of people have been subjected to legally enforceable quarantines or are in \u201cself-quarantine.\u201d The federal government has also banned entry by non\u2013U.S. nationals traveling from China, Iran, and most of Europe and is screening passengers returning from heavily affected countries. Still, the numbers of cases and deaths continue to rise.\nQuarantines and travel bans are often the first response against new infectious diseases. However, these old tools are usually of limited utility for highly transmissible diseases, and if imposed with too heavy a hand, or in too haphazard a manner, they can be counterproductive.1 With a virus such as SARS-CoV-2, they cannot provide a sufficient response.\nSign up for the Weekly Table of Contents email.\nEach week, receive an email with links to the articles published in the current week's issue of the New England Journal of Medicine. SIGN UP\nIn public health practice, \u201cquarantine\u201d refers to the separation of persons (or communities) who have been exposed to an infectious disease. \u201cIsolation,\u201d in contrast, applies to the separation of persons who are known to be infected. In U.S. law, however, \u201cquarantine\u201d often refers to both types of interventions, as well as to limits on travel. Isolation and quarantine can be voluntary or imposed by law.\nInside the country, isolation and quarantine orders have traditionally come from the states. Courts have typically upheld these orders in deference to the states\u2019 broad powers to protect public health. Nevertheless, courts have occasionally intervened when a quarantine was unreasonable or when officials failed to follow necessary procedures. For example, in Jew Ho v. Williamson (1900), a federal court struck down a quarantine imposed by San Francisco in response to an outbreak of bubonic plague because it was racially motivated and ill-suited to stop the outbreak.\nAlthough isolation and quarantine orders have been less common in recent decades, many states have isolated patients with tuberculosis who did not adhere to medication regimens.2 At least 18 states quarantined people returning from West Africa during the 2014 Ebola outbreak.3 In March 2019, Rockland County, New York, prohibited all minors who were unvaccinated against measles from entering any place of public assembly. In W.D. v. County of Rockland (2019), a New York State judge struck down that order, ruling that there was no emergency. Most states, however, do not require an emergency declaration in order to issue a quarantine.\nThe federal quarantine power is limited to preventing the spread of communicable diseases into the country or across state lines. Section 361 of the Public Health Service Act grants the Surgeon General the power (since delegated to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC]) to apprehend, detain, or issue a conditional release for the purpose of preventing the introduction into the country, or the spread across state lines, of a quarantinable disease, as designated by executive order (see box). The current list includes \u201csevere acute respiratory syndromes,\u201d which encompasses Covid-19.\nQUARANTINABLE DISEASES.*\nCholera\nDiphtheria\nInfectious tuberculosis\nPlague\nSmallpox\nYellow fever\nViral hemorrhagic fevers\nSevere acute respiratory syndromes\nInfluenza that can cause a pandemic\n* From the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Legal authorities for isolation and quarantine. www.cdc.gov/quarantine/aboutlawsregulationsquarantineisolation.html\n. opens in new tab\n.\nDespite the breadth of its powers, the CDC has generally focused on providing expert guidance to states during outbreaks. In 2017, however, the agency issued new quarantine regulations (codified in 42 Code of Federal Regulations [CFR], parts 70 and 71) suggesting that it would no longer defer to the states. These regulations make clear that, independent of state action, the CDC may isolate, quarantine, examine, or bar travel of anyone within the country who CDC officials reasonably believe may bring a communicable disease into the country or spread it across state lines. When the secretary of health and human services declares a public health emergency, as Secretary Alex Azar did on January 31, these orders can be issued against persons in the precommunicable stage, which begins at a person\u2019s earliest opportunity for exposure to an infection and ends on the latest date at which the person could reasonably be expected to become contagious.\nThe regulations also commit the CDC to providing medical care for people who are detained, but they may charge insurers for that care. In addition, they establish a multilevel internal administrative review process. But they do not ensure expeditious or independent review of detention orders or travel bans. Moreover, although the CDC stated that it would \u201cseek to use the least restrictive means necessary to prevent the spread of communicable diseases,\u201d the regulations do not require the agency to adhere to that standard. Though the CDC\u2019s quarantine powers permit it to deny entry into the United States for a quarantinable disease, President Trump relied on Sections 212(f) and 215(a) of the Immigration and Naturalization Act to ban Chinese and Iranian nationals from entering the country.\nDespite their breadth, the federal and state quarantine powers are subject to important constitutional limitations.2 First, as Jew Ho affirmed, quarantines cannot be imposed in a racially invidious manner. Second, governments must have a strong basis for the restrictions. Looking to case law regarding civil commitment, many scholars and some lower courts have concluded that isolation and quarantine are constitutional only when the government can show by clear and compelling evidence that they are the least restrictive means of protecting the public\u2019s health. However, at least two federal courts reviewing postdetention challenges to Ebola quarantines held that the standard was not sufficiently well established to allow the claims to go forward.3 Third, persons who are detained, or whose liberty is otherwise restricted, are entitled to judicial review \u2014 traditionally under the writ of habeas corpus.3 Finally, when governments detain people, they must meet those people\u2019s basic needs, ensuring access to health care, medication, food, and sanitation. Such standards are not only constitutionally compelled: they are critical to ensuring that detained persons comply with orders.\nAlthough we are likely to see greater use of robust social distancing measures, such as school closures or the cancellation of public meetings, broad sanitary cordons \u2014 in which geographic areas are quarantined \u2014 would raise serious constitutional questions. They also can present numerous logistical challenges and can increase the risk to those living in the restricted zone. Such measures may also have limited efficacy with a highly contagious disease such as Covid-19.4\nWith community transmission occurring in several parts of the United States, it is time to recognize that travel bans and mandatory quarantines alone cannot end the outbreak. In a public letter to the Trump administration, we (along with more than 800 other public health and legal scholars and organizations) argue that more constructive tools are needed.5\nFlattening the curve \u2014 slowing the spread of Covid-19 across space and time \u2014 is critical. The health care system cannot sustain a massive influx of infectious cases to emergency departments and hospitals. Patients with mild symptoms should stay home when possible. To facilitate this step, workers should be allowed to telecommute wherever it\u2019s feasible to do so. But many low-wage and gig workers cannot afford to stay home. Nor can they handle the economic impact of other social distancing measures that may help to slow transmission. On March 13, the House of Representatives, with President Trump\u2019s support, took the first step by passing the Families First Coronavirus Response Act, which includes provisions for paid sick leave and unemployment insurance for many, but unfortunately not all, workers. As of mid March, the Senate has yet to take up the bill.\nWe must also reduce hurdles to testing and care. The House bill would provide free testing, but more needs to be done to ensure that testing kits are available. Furthermore, noncitizens must be protected from adverse immigration consequences for seeking testing or care or for complying with contact tracing. Finally, emergency guidance or regulations can be issued to limit the financial impact of high-deductible health plans and \u201csurprise bills\u201d from out-of-network providers for Covid-19 diagnosis or treatment.\nDespite the breadth and allure of travel bans and mandatory quarantine, an effective response to Covid-19 requires newer, more creative legal tools. With Covid-19 in our communities, the time has come to imagine and implement public health laws that emphasize support rather than restriction.\nDisclosure forms provided by the authors are available at NEJM.org.\nThis article was published on March 18, 2020, at NEJM.org.\nAuthor Affiliations\nFrom the Center for Health Policy and Law, Northeastern University School of Law (W.E.P., M.S.S.), the Harvard\u2013MIT Center for Regulatory Science (M.S.S.), and Harvard Medical School (M.S.S.) \u2014 all in Boston.\nSupplementary Material\nDisclosure Forms PDF 154KB\nReferences (5)\nCiting Articles (8)", "10.1056/NEJMp2007637": "5 References\nUrgent responses to the Covid-19 pandemic have halted movement and work and dramatically changed daily routines for much of the world\u2019s population.

SIGN UP\nWhen and how will restrictions be unwound? Should they remain in place until the \u201call clear\u201d signal, or until some intermediate milestone is reached (e.g., once infections or transmission risks have peaked or hospitals have regained capacity)? Will restrictions be lifted completely or merely loosened, and for how long? The relatively clear criteria for ending conventional quarantine and isolation don\u2019t apply to social restrictions related to Covid-19. The rudimentary understanding of the disease and the unprecedented breadth of restrictions feed uncertainty about next steps. A showdown between public health imperatives and civil liberties appears inevitable.\nLaw and public policy have a long history of deference to intrusive action by public health authorities, especially during deadly infectious disease outbreaks. There are limits, however.1 To respect civil liberties, courts have insisted that coercive restrictions must be necessary; must be crafted as narrowly as possible \u2014 in their intrusiveness, duration, and scope \u2014 to achieve the protective goal; and must not be used to target ostracized groups.2 Although these broad principles are useful touchstones, historical experience with quarantine provides little practical guidance because of several distinctive features of Covid-19 and the public health response it provokes.\nFirst, deprivations of basic liberties in response to epidemics have chiefly focused on infected or exposed people or defined groups (think \u201creturning cruise passengers\u201d). By contrast, current stay-at-home orders are less intrusive in some respects (they are lightly enforced, and \u201cessential\u201d outings are permitted) and more intrusive in others (most people subjected to them are neither infected nor exposed). This combination of moderation and breadth makes the principles of individualized \u201cdue process\u201d developed for traditional quarantine orders less applicable. Because restrictions related to Covid-19 are motivated by community-wide risk and apply to entire populations, legal protections focused on how much risk one person poses to others have little relevance. Moreover, because many restrictions apply to the government\u2019s own institutions (e.g., parks and schools) or are imposed by private actors (e.g., employers), they avoid standard constitutional scrutiny.\nSecond, the transmission dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 make it difficult to identify and target risk groups. The virus is highly infectious and has a long but still uncertain transmission window, possibly spanning 10 to 14 days. \u201cStealth\u201d transmission may occur during asymptomatic incubation or while illness is imperceptible or nondistinct. These factors create control problems that differ from those associated with the diseases, such as smallpox and tuberculosis, that shaped much of the law and policy precedents we have for restrictive public health actions.\nStructural Features of Traditional and Graduated Approaches to Infectious Disease Control.\nThird, stay-at-home restrictions are unlikely to be a one-shot deal. Disease prevalence will spike and abate. There is emerging consensus that a graduated approach to restrictive measures will be needed3 \u2014 one that permits a return to some social and economic activity while avoiding undue stress on medical resources and allowing population immunity to build gradually (see table). Such an approach is a far cry from quarantine law\u2019s more binary paradigm of lockdown followed by an all clear signal.2\nWhat laws would govern a graduated approach? More relevant than quarantine-based precedents are legal challenges to emergency curfews during natural disasters or civil unrest.4 Courts have upheld these orders when they are supported by facts demonstrating that the curfew is needed to restore peace and security.5 Some courts have reviewed the hours, geographic scope, and duration of curfews and considered whether they are indexed appropriately to the threat level.4 But above all, curfew law highlights the substantial leeway that courts give the government in exigent circumstances. As one appeals court put it, whether the harsh restrictions in question \u201cwere absolutely necessary in order to prevent a serious civil disorder is clearly an important question for political debate, but not, we think, a question for judicial resolution.\u201d5\nViewing Covid-19\u2013related restrictions as more of a public policy issue than a legal one, then, how can a graduated model chart a course that appropriately balances disease control and civil liberties? We believe that decisions to continue, modify, or lift severe restrictions \u2014 particularly bans on movement and gathering \u2014 should be tailored using credible person-level information. The key source of such information would be a population-wide program of disease testing and surveillance. By identifying people most likely to transmit infection in the near term, individualized risk assessment would respond to Covid-19\u2019s distinctively dangerous risk profile. At the same time, it would avoid sharp trade-offs between discriminatory or unduly broad restrictions and the perils associated with wholesale loosening of restrictions.\nTo be sure, testing itself is an intrusion. But considering this pandemic\u2019s magnitude, effective testing can reduce or prevent the need for much greater intrusions. Moreover, a degree of voluntariness is maintained by eschewing forced testing and instead conditioning social privileges on cooperation.\nConsider, for example, a policy in which people seeking to return to work, school, or social activities are asked to undergo baseline testing for infection and antibodies. Positive tests for infection would trigger self-isolation. Negative tests would certify freedom of movement for a defined period \u2014 say, 2 or 3 weeks \u2014 after which additional negative tests would renew the certification. If antibodies are determined to provide long-term protection against both reinfection and transmission \u2014 which is plausible but not yet established \u2014 a positive serologic test would warrant longer-term certification.\nAggregating test results at community and state levels would support a reliable disease-surveillance system. A testing regimen\u2019s stringency could then be dialed up or down, depending on community prevalence of Covid-19. China is following a version of this approach by grading community risk on a four-tier, color-coded scale.\nTitrating restrictive measures in this way would require a testing regimen on a scale unparalleled in U.S. history. Federal, state, and local governments would play a role in financing and oversight but would need to rely heavily on hospitals, clinics, nursing homes, retail pharmacies, mobile health services, and private laboratories for implementation. Civil-society organizations (e.g., employers, schools, and retailers) would also have financial and reputational incentives to foster compliance with government directives.\nWould individualized risk assessment of this kind be lawful? Provided the approach was based on verifiable risk of contagion, used reliable methods, and was applied evenhandedly, there are no obvious obstacles in quarantine- or curfew-law precedents. The insidiousness of Covid-19 transmission coupled with the (presumed) low rate of acquired immunity mean that most people are at appreciable risk for contracting or spreading the virus, so mass testing has a legitimate public health purpose. Most important, tying testing to easing of restrictions makes it an integral component of a strategy for restoring civil liberties.\nLimitations in this approach are clear. Vast quantities of tests and personal protective equipment would be needed, neither of which currently exists, although supplies will increase. Acquiring and transmitting infection within certification periods would still be possible; people could also test negative in the early stage of infection. A policy of extending privileges to people with acquired immunity must guard against incentives for them to deliberately become infected. In addition, civil-society organizations charged with enforcement could game the system to gain a competitive advantage or to discriminate. Policing such behavior would be the role of government and the legal system; proactive cultivation of social norms using exemplars and shaming would also help.\nThese and other imperfections in test-centered approaches to graduated unwinding and reimposing of restrictions reflect the inevitable compromise to be made between disease control and protection of civil liberties. In ordinary times, a comprehensive program of testing, certification, and retesting would be beyond the pale. Today, it seems like a fair price to pay for safely and fairly resuming a semblance of normal life.\nDisclosure forms provided by the authors are available at NEJM.org.\nThis article was published on April 9, 2020, at NEJM.org.\nAuthor Affiliations\nFrom the Stanford University Schools of Law and Medicine, Stanford, CA (D.M.S.); and the Wake Forest Schools of Law and Medicine, Winston-Salem, NC (M.A.H.).\nSupplementary Material\nDisclosure Forms PDF 75KB\nReferences (5)", "10.1056/NEJMp2006376": "4 References\nCurrent efforts to fight the Covid-19 pandemic aim to slow viral spread and increase testing, protect health care workers from infection, and obtain ventilators and other equipment to prepare for a surge of critically ill patients. But additional actions are needed to rapidly increase health workforce capacity and to replenish it when personnel are quarantined or need time off to rest or care for sick family members. It seems clear that health care delivery organizations, educators, and government leaders will all have to be willing to cut through bureaucratic barriers and adapt regulations to rapidly expand the U.S. health care workforce and sustain it for the duration of the pandemic.\nAs hospitals and nursing homes gear up for expected increases in critically ill patients, they should examine all opportunities to expand their workforce capacity. Where the threat of postpandemic legal consequences hampers action to expand capacity, such barriers could be removed by governors enacting emergency orders that modify or temporarily rescind medical malpractice policies that inhibit health professionals\u2019 ability to expand their scope of practice as required. Most organizations, however, will find that outdated internal policies such as workflows, task-delegation protocols, or union agreements are the main culprits in restricting the shifting of tasks and responsibilities among personnel. These restrictions can be changed to allow health workers to fully use their knowledge and skills.

SIGN UP\nPublic and private payers play a critical role in increasing the workforce\u2019s capacity to meet patients\u2019 needs. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) has taken unprecedented steps through the 1135 waiver program1 and expanded telehealth coverage2 to increase the flexibility of Medicare, Medicaid, and Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program payments, expanding the types of services that can be covered, broadening the number and types of providers eligible for payments, and allowing services to be provided in a wider range of settings, including patients\u2019 homes. Governors can propose additional flexibility in their Medicaid programs by requesting waivers. Some private insurers have unilaterally expanded their coverage, and these efforts should be encouraged. Efforts need to focus not only on increasing workforce capacity, but also on sustaining it over the course of the pandemic. CMS has also issued guidance allowing hospitals to provide benefits to support staff, such as multiple daily meals, laundry service for personal clothing, or child care services.\nWhile government and private efforts focus on obtaining and producing ventilators, hospitals will require personnel who can operate these machines. Hospital associations can develop strategies to deploy respiratory therapists to the hospitals most in need and to develop programs to quickly train workers who can operate this technology competently; respiratory-therapy education programs can accelerate the preparation of therapists.\nMedical students in their third and fourth years who are no longer in clinical rotations can help expand the workforce by performing various medical tasks to free up clinicians for Covid-19 care. They can, for example, triage and assess patients, collect and analyze data needed for institutional decision making, and perform administrative tasks. Hospitals have suspended students\u2019 access to their facilities in order to preserve scarce supplies and focus on their care delivery mission. But because students need clinical skill development and clinical hours to satisfy graduation requirements, it\u2019s important to find ways to adapt these restrictions to avert a bottleneck in the educational pipeline. Tens of thousands of U.S. students in the final semester of their education program could help create surge capacity and sustain the workforce if the pandemic is prolonged.\nTo assist hospitals in meeting this challenge, education programs can develop classes to train students in the skills most immediately needed. Accreditation bodies can allow students to count work hours toward graduation requirements. State licensure organizations can issue emergency or temporary licenses to fourth-year medical students, and to nurse practitioner, physician assistant, registered nurse, and other health profession students who are near the end of their programs. Students\u2019 health care organizations can waive the background checks that most require as a condition of employment. Inflexibility and lack of creativity could stall efforts to expand the current workforce and jeopardize longer-term workforce stability at a time when health workers are critically needed.\nOrganizations can also expand workforce capacity by identifying health care professionals who have either retired or temporarily left the workforce and encouraging them to return to work. Using this strategy, New York City recently saw 1000 retired physicians and nurses volunteer to rejoin the workforce in a single day.3 Other states\u2019 licensure boards could immediately reinstate the licenses of professionals whose credentials expired in the past 3 years.\nThere are many other opportunities for creating surge capacity. Dentists, dental hygienists and assistants, dental therapists, optometrists and optometry technicians, chiropractors, and hearing technicians are among those whose practices have closed because of Covid-19. Such health professionals can be trained to conduct screenings, take vital signs, provide telephone follow-up of quarantined people with Covid-19, collect epidemiologic data, and provide community education. Short online courses and training documents could be developed to prepare these workers for such roles and to quickly scale up the capacity of the community workforce.\nIt\u2019s also important for community health leaders to plan for the needs of millions of people in the United States who require treatment for mental health disorders. Health care providers, patients in isolation, and people affected by shelter-in-place orders are likely to experience considerable psychological distress. Not to be forgotten are people suffering from inadequate housing, food insecurity, isolation, and low income, who are vulnerable to being left behind as social and economic reactions to the pandemic intensify. Social workers are pivotal in helping vulnerable people by providing mental and behavioral interventions and helping people access food, housing, and social services. Health care organizations and health departments can also partner with community health workers, peer-support workers, occupational and physical therapists, and home health workers to identify and attend to social needs, including helping patients with Covid-19 adhere to their medical treatment.\nGovernment leaders and regulators will need to help expand capacity and ensure the full use of our workforce throughout the pandemic.4 As seen in Europe, China, and now the United States, the effects of Covid-19 are regionally concentrated. Health care workers need to be able to offer telehealth services across state lines and provide triage, screening, monitoring, and counseling. States will therefore have to allow out-of-state licensed professionals to practice under emergency authorization, even if they\u2019re not part of interstate licensing compacts. It serves no purpose to limit use of our telehealth capabilities because of legal restrictions and regulations, particularly when the population is being asked to stay at home. Physicians, nurse practitioners, physician assistants, respiratory therapists, pharmacists, clinical psychologists, marriage and family counselors, mental health specialists, peer-support therapists, licensed social workers, and others should be allowed and encouraged to use this tool.\nFinally, governors and state regulators should examine regulations to determine whether health professionals\u2019 scope of practice is being unnecessarily restricted. Nurse practitioners can practice safely without formal physician oversight, and there may be unnecessary restrictions on registered nurses and licensed practical nurses. As more patients require care provided by registered nurses, licensed practical nurses and nursing and home care assistants could be trained and authorized to provide more services to ensure continuity of care, especially for vulnerable and frail older adults.\nHow well the country handles the Covid-19 crisis depends largely on how effectively our health workforce is used. Much can be done to ensure that the workforce is prepared to defeat the pandemic. Some actions discussed here are temporary, whereas others \u2014 such as expanding scopes of practice, cross-state licensure, and allowing greater use of telehealth services \u2014 probably make sense in general but are especially critical now. Now is the time for pragmatic steps to expand and sustain the health workforce. Once the pandemic has subsided, workforce changes should be evaluated and the results used to inform wiser use of the workforce and improved responses to future pandemics.\nDisclosure forms provided by the authors are available at NEJM.org.\nThis article was published on April 8, 2020, at NEJM.org.\nAuthor Affiliations\nFrom the Carolina Health Workforce Research Center, the Cecil G.

SIGN UP\nReviewing Sally\u2019s chart (she insists that I call her by her first name), I learn about her many visits and e-messages to our medical center over the weeks leading up to an elective, come-and-go procedure that turned into a 4-day hospitalization. I\u2019d only had time to glance through her chart before her serendipitously scheduled routine follow-up geriatrics consultation with me a few days after her discharge. Now I read more carefully, piecing together a story that\u2019s unique yet all too familiar. My concern for Sally rapidly transmogrifies into mortal fear for the patient population at highest risk for hospitalization and death, whether from Covid-19 or most anything else.\nHere is how clinicians might see Sally: morbidly obese elderly female with heart, lung, and kidney disease, atrial fibrillation, sleep apnea, depression, and polyarthritis. If you look only at her chart, the familiar picture of a high-risk elder with multiple health conditions emerges.\nBut here is another, equally accurate portrait of Sally: witty, smart, curious older woman with many friends, who recently retired from a social service career and moved to California to be near her supportive children, a smartphone addict, leader in her church, political activist, free-live-theater aficionado, and resident of a continuing care community she chose as much for its low cost and social opportunities as for its ability to manage her future care needs.\nMany of Sally\u2019s clinicians appear unaware of these personal details, even though it\u2019s impossible to provide patient-centered care without them. But treating the social history as extraneous is common,1 and she has clearly received outstanding care and regular follow-up from our acute care clinic for her recent pneumonia and exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Less laudable was a specialist\u2019s decision to proceed with an elective procedure when her breathing had not returned to baseline and his note calling that procedure \u201csuccessful\u201d and \u201cwithout complications.\u201d Though the procedure was detailed, the note only briefly mentioned Sally\u2019s unplanned hospital stay, new heart failure, respiratory and functional decompensation, and aftercare needs \u2014 from home health care to the rapid follow-up most likely to prevent a costly readmission.\nOn the day of Sally\u2019s appointment with me, having skimmed the proceduralist\u2019s discharge summary, I felt only minor concern as I entered the examination room.\nI didn\u2019t recognize Sally until she smiled.\nHer face was bloated, her hair disheveled, and her countenance lacked its previous vitality, humor, and confidence. She seemed physically and psychologically diminished. Her history and exam only reinforced this impression. Worst of all, after 25 years as a geriatrician, I am as close to certain as a clinician without a crystal ball can be that she will never return to her previous health, functional, and social status \u2014 that her life will become what her long-standing advance directive describes as \u201cnot worth living.\u201d\nDuring a pandemic in which 80% of U.S. deaths are in people over 65, especially affecting those who are around 80 with underlying conditions,2 health leaders and clinicians might reasonably conclude that they\u2019re too busy saving lives to also consider preventing the hazards of hospitalization for elders or their postdischarge lives. In a crisis, they might argue, different rules apply.\nThis unprecedented crisis is exactly why we need to think now about how best to manage the care of sick elders \u2014 for their sake and in consideration of near- and longer-term costs and stresses to the health care system. Sally\u2019s recent hospitalization didn\u2019t just ruin her life; it\u2019s the reason she now needs long-term respiratory and other services that might otherwise be available to patients with Covid-19.\nSeveral straightforward strategic additions to current pandemic management will save lives and essential resources.\nWe can start by sticking to the facts. The Wall Street Journal quoted a pulmonologist as saying that the patients on the Princess Cruise ship were not like the average septuagenarian because \u201cThey are not bedridden.\u201d The average 70-something is not bedridden. People in their 70s run two of the three branches of our government and represent the most rapidly growing segment of the U.S. labor force. If the pandemic doesn\u2019t change life expectancy, half the U.S. population will live past 80 years of age.\nSecond, we can harness the expertise and person-power of the many clinicians and clinician-researchers who can\u2019t currently do their usual work to develop crisis-related protocols for ambulatory, institutionalized, homebound, and hospitalized patients, with special attention to elders and other populations with predictably high health care needs. Such protocols will allow optimal triage and care of patients with and without Covid-19, thereby reducing pressures on crisis-focused clinicians and the health system.\nThird, we can acknowledge the particular presentations, needs, and risks of elders in our protocols and planning. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention did not create a Covid-19 Web page directed to elders until mid-March, nearly 2 months after we learned of that group\u2019s extraordinarily high risk for critical illness and death. Most medical centers have protocols for children and adults, but nothing for elders. Basic standards of health equity demand protocols with elder-specific diagnostic, treatment, and outcome-prediction tools, addressing lower baseline and illness-related body temperatures, atypical disease presentations, and care options geared to the life stage, health status, and life expectancy of older patients.\nSuch an approach would have prevented Sally from being offered a \u201croutine,\u201d \u201celective,\u201d \u201clow-risk\u201d procedure that ended, predictably, as an expensive medical fiasco with ongoing costs and consequences. In medicine\u2019s current framing of old age, Sally\u2019s age and multiple conditions are blamed for this outcome. In truth, an approach recognizing her life priorities, functional status, and age-specific medical risks and needs would have prevented her from receiving low-value care. Risk assessment and high-quality care cannot be accomplished by looking only at age and diagnoses. Sally would still be a vibrant, active member of society but for her recent medical care.\nFourth, we can help prevent or delay rationing by prioritizing advance care planning. As a geriatrician and an octogenarian\u2019s daughter, I know many happy, engaged elders in their 70s, 80s, 90s, and 100s \u2014 including Sally \u2014 who would not want to be put on a respirator if they become critically ill from Covid-19. Patients and our health system would be better served if all adults and elders use some of the spare time created by our new, home-confined lives to discuss and document their care preferences,3 whether their goal is aggressive, supportive, or palliative care. The absence of such planning increases suffering at the end of life, and its presence helps people with serious or life-limiting illness to live and die according to their personal priorities.4\nIf we ignore age, we too often provide costly, ineffective care. We undertreat \u2014 seeing only \u201celderly\u201d or \u201cmultimorbidity\u201d \u2014 or overtreat, as recently happened to Sally. But if we make age the sole criterion for rationing, we take a giant step toward overt valuing of some lives over others. Not only does that approach defy the core tenets of medicine, but a glance at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services definition of \u201cspecial populations\u201d reveals that it would put most of us at risk for second-class care.5 We must do everything possible to avoid the first step down that slippery slope.\nDisclosure forms provided by the author are available at NEJM.org.\nThe patient\u2019s name has been changed to protect her privacy.\nThis article was published on April 7, 2020, at NEJM.org.\nAuthor Affiliations\nFrom the Division of Geriatrics, Department of Medicine, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco.\nSupplementary Material\nDisclosure Forms PDF 46KB\nReferences (5)", "10.1056/NEJMp2005118": "5 References\nHow sad that the people who remember the last major pandemic \u2014 influenza in 1968 \u2014 are the primary victims of today\u2019s.

SIGN UP\nFirst, we need to work with our public health colleagues to ensure that population-based interventions \u2014 including social distancing, quarantine, and isolation actions \u2014 are taken promptly and prudently in order to flatten the epidemic curve.\nSecond, we can use the foundations of preparedness built over recent decades to respond to the challenges of a novel threat. None of us is an island; we must work with our health systems and local and regional partners though health care coalitions and other constructs to share information and policies and to create a regional framework that supports a consistent level of care. The following actions are ones that we believe health care organizations must prioritize immediately so that we can do the most with what we have available.\nTo begin with, organizations need to establish incident command. Using well-developed principles of incident action planning and the concepts of crisis standards of care,1 hospitals can plan for volume-based adjustments to care delivery in all services lines, balancing demand and focusing resources on acute care.2 The pandemic is a long-term dynamic event that will require nearly constant proactive strategy development and problem solving.\nIn conjunction with public health efforts, hospitals can dramatically expand access to testing through commercial, hospital, and public health laboratories. We cannot afford large numbers of persons seeking care at health care facilities and exposing each other as well as uninfected patients. Rapid testing to ensure appropriate sorting of inpatients into cohorts is required, as is testing of staff members who are ill, in order to define safe work practices. Public health officials must take a lead role in clearly communicating which patients truly need testing and who can safely stay home to prevent the medical care system from being overwhelmed.\nIn addition, understanding people\u2019s end-of-life wishes is of critical importance in a situation of potential resource scarcity in the face of an illness that can require prolonged aggressive interventions. Difficult questions need to be addressed, such as how to approach each person\u2019s desire for longer-term mechanical ventilation, dialysis, and continuation of aggressive measures if others are dying without them. If we don\u2019t ask these questions, we may not have the chance to honor wishes that could have saved another patient.\nAt the same time, we need to expand inpatient critical care. A staged plan to meet or exceed the 200% increase in critical care beds advised by the American College of Chest Physicians should be developed using expanded areas of cohort care for patients with Covid-19.3 Non\u2013Covid-related services will need to be preserved as well, so hospitals should determine how staffing will be managed to accommodate surges in demand across a wide range of needs. They will have to plan for facility and regional processes for triage of resources, since there may be a shortage of \u201capex therapies\u201d (therapies that prevent death and have no appropriate substitute); in particular, it\u2019s important to agree on principles of initiation and withdrawal of ECMO and to use the processes dictated by crisis standards of care to make difficult decisions about other critical care resources, in keeping with published guidelines and evolving information about Covid-19 prognosis.4,5 A regional plan for critical care referrals may optimize consistency as well as efficiency of transfers.\nExpansion of inpatient critical care also relies on long-term care, alternative systems of care (including alternative care sites), and home-based care to bear a greater burden of discharges; careful planning with long-term care providers is critical, since patients convalescing from Covid-19 should be discharged only to designated facilities or to those already caring for such patients.\nProtecting health care workers is essential, and despite increases in production, we cannot avoid the reality that demand for N95 respirator masks and other personal protective equipment (PPE) will continue to exceed supply for the near future. We must conserve masks and other protective equipment now, so that clinicians can be protected later. We must also be strategic in our plans for PPE use and consider extraordinary strategies to extend our supply, including extended wear and reuse, as well as convalescent providers forgoing PPE while working with infected patients.\nEven if we do our best at protection, maintaining an adequate health care workforce in the face of school closures and illness will be exceptionally difficult. Undertaking new assignments, practicing at \u201ctop of license,\u201d reducing documentation and other burdens, and using ancillary personnel, family members, and convalescent community volunteers may help to support patient care. Working long shifts in social and physical isolation while wearing PPE, risking illness and even death, and working under great duress in new and demanding roles will harm our providers. Hospitals should be prepared to support them at work and at home to mitigate this stress, promoting resilience, providing appropriate rest, and rewarding their service. Educating staff now on their potential roles, challenges, use of PPE, and the expected adaptations to their practice can help empower them and anticipate their needs.\nThere are some opportunities for augmenting resources. Covid-19 seems to affect children at much lower rates than older adults, so many pediatric resources may be available for both outpatient and inpatient adult support. Specialty clinic and elective procedure volumes may decrease rapidly, owing to both patient preference and decisions to cancel procedures, which will free up providers, clinics, and operating rooms that can be leveraged for acute care. Ambulatory surgical centers, procedure centers, and other facilities may offer substantial capacity, as well as staff well versed in monitoring patients with complex conditions.\nTremendous expansion of care is possible with creative use of space, staff, and supplies. However, the health care response will still be dependent for the most part on what we have right now and the public health actions that will help to blunt (though probably prolong) the impact.\nWe applaud the $8.5 billion in federal funding for Covid-19 and the state legislatures that are passing emergency funding bills, but these steps are akin to ordering the best fire engine possible while your home burns. Why, in the years since the 2009 H1N1 influenza threat have we not developed artificial intelligence solutions integrated with our electronic health records that could be giving us real-time information on prognosis and treatment effectiveness? Why do we assume that a health care system that must run at maximal efficiency and full occupancy to survive will, without additional support, suddenly be able to meet the needs of all in a crisis? Why do we not have caches of inexpensive volume-cycled ventilators with basic alarm systems?\nBecause we fail to learn the lessons and dedicate the funding and planning efforts required. Because doing so is not prioritized by regulators, payers, or most hospital leaders. Because the need is not understood by the public. Because you can\u2019t rely on private-sector infrastructure to take on a massive public responsibility in disasters without proper planning and resources.\nNo matter how severe the impact of Covid-19 is, the onus is on us all to do better next time, whether that outbreak is 1 year or 20 years hence. Let us clearly communicate our limitations and abilities and agree on where we want to be \u2014 with agreed-on thresholds, standards, and enterprise-wide capabilities that allow us to say we learned our lessons this time.\nDisclosure forms provided by the authors are available at NEJM.org.\nThis article was published on March 25, 2020, at NEJM.org.\nAuthor Affiliations\nFrom the Department of Emergency Medicine, University of Minnesota, and Hennepin Healthcare \u2014 both in Minneapolis (J.L.H.); and the Department of Emergency Medicine, Harvard Medical School, and Massachusetts General Hospital \u2014 both in Boston (P.D.B.).\nSupplementary Material\nDisclosure Forms PDF 75KB\nReferences (5)", "10.1056/NEJMp2005032": "5 References\nIn the face of increasing Covid-19 transmission and mortality around the world, many commentators have described this emerging pandemic as a \u201cperfect storm\u201d \u2014 a vastly overused characterization that evokes a sense of anomaly and unpredictability.

SIGN UP\nWriter Susan Sontag argued that the metaphors we use to describe disease profoundly shape our experience of illness; our cultural discourse regarding diseases such as cancer and AIDS, for instance, produces fear and stigma that hinder care and marginalize patients.2 Similarly, the perfect-storm metaphor may misdirect our concepts of \u2014 and therefore our approach to addressing \u2014 emerging pandemics. This language creates a public health discourse that seems reactive rather than proactive, reductive rather than holistic, disempowering rather than empowering. Though its inherent drama may be appealing, the term \u201cperfect storm\u201d invokes notions of randomness and volatility that may actually undermine our ability to address the Covid-19 pandemic and future disease outbreaks.\nThe global AIDS crisis of the 1980s and 1990s highlighted the reality that despite growing prevalence and attention to chronic, noncommunicable conditions, infectious disease remains with us, in the form of pathogens both ancient and new. The emergence of AIDS raised fundamental questions about infrastructural decline, drug development, and health care access in the United States and abroad. And in the face of what was at first a uniformly fatal disease, AIDS activists demonstrated that concerted political action can change the course of a deadly, global pandemic \u2014 even in the absence of a vaccine.\nIn the context of the AIDS epidemic, the Institute of Medicine (IOM, now the National Academy of Medicine) catalogued our vulnerabilities to a wide range of infectious threats. In a 1992 report, the IOM declared that \u201cthe best way to prepare for the future is by developing and implementing preventive strategies that can meet the challenges offered by emerging and reemerging microbes. It is infinitely less costly, in every way, to attack an emerging disease at an early stage \u2014 and thus prevent its spread \u2014 than to rely on treatment to control the disease.\u201d3 Ultimately, the IOM recommended four areas of investment to prepare for future pandemics: core U.S. public health infrastructure, infectious disease research and epidemic surveillance training, vaccine and drug development, and public education and behavioral change.\nThe repeated emergence of new zoonotic infections such as the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), H1N1 influenza, the Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (MERS), Zika, and Ebola \u2014 as well as the resurgence of old infectious diseases such as measles and cholera \u2014 underscores the reality that global epidemics should be expected and their harms anticipated. The rise of the planetary health field indicates a growing awareness of the intricate ecologic relationships among humans, other animals, and our environment.4 Seen in this light, outbreaks of zoonotic diseases are not discrete events: they reflect complex ecosystem changes that are largely driven by human behavior. Nonetheless, during each of these recent epidemics, \u201cperfect storm\u201d headlines were ubiquitous. Invoking perfect storms in such instances downplays our capacity to anticipate and prevent epidemics before they emerge.\nOf course, use of this term is not limited to discussions of communicable disease. One journalist noted recently that \u201copioid addiction looks like the result of a perfect storm of poverty, trauma, availability, and pain.\u201d5 This kind of explanation erodes a sense of social accountability for how public health crises develop and evolve. In this case, the perfect-storm metaphor may undermine our ability to hold powerful actors such as the pharmaceutical industry accountable for the staggering death toll of the ongoing U.S. opioid epidemic.\nNaturalizing the rise of a pandemic as a perfect storm, in fact, might imply that a health crisis is beyond the scope of human agency altogether. But of course, even so-called natural disasters are not perfect storms. Crises such as Hurricane Katrina in 2005 and the 2010 earthquake in Haiti had such extreme effects on morbidity and mortality because of long-standing histories of political disenfranchisement and neglect of infrastructure in the affected regions. In the setting of anthropogenic climate change, perfect-storm language elides important conversations about our responsibility for the frequency of both emerging zoonoses and extreme weather events \u2014 as well as the disproportionate effects of these crises on the world\u2019s most vulnerable people.\nIn all these public health contexts, a perfect-storm frame of mind emphasizes the power of chance over the efficacy of public health prevention efforts. But past zoonotic outbreaks have made clear that long-term investments in disease tracking and surveillance, scientific research, and public health infrastructure are the keys to containing the next emerging threat. These strategies do not always fit within our biomedical paradigm, which champions targeted interventions such as vaccine development and medical treatment. But basic, nonspecific practices of epidemic prevention and preparedness are essential to infectious disease control.\nEpidemics are not simply natural events: they are also the result of human actions, in both their emergence and containment. If we treat each new epidemic as a perfect storm, it becomes that much harder to build the conviction that we can prepare for the next crisis. The path to strengthening our public health infrastructure will be challenging and will require systemic change. In the meantime, conceptualizing epidemics as perfect storms, even when well intentioned, will make it more difficult for us to move beyond calls for change to actual investment and implementation. Covid-19 may be a novel virus, but such outbreaks have long been anticipated. Many kinds of reform will be required to prepare for the next pandemic, but being conscientious about our language \u2014 and its implications \u2014 may be a helpful first step.\nDisclosure forms provided by the authors are available at NEJM.org.\nAuthor Affiliations\nFrom the Department of the History of Science, Harvard University, Cambridge (A.M.B., A.B.), and the Department of Global Health and Social Medicine (A.M.B.) and the Medical Scientist Training Program (A.B.), Boston \u2014 all in Massachusetts.\nSupplementary Material\nDisclosure Forms PDF 159KB\nReferences (5)", "10.1056/NEJMp2006588": "3 References\n\u201cDoctor, should we activate the sepsis protocol?\u201d my medical assistant asked with obvious concern. I triaged the patient in question. The metrics that had caused alarm at intake were tachycardia and tachypnea, but there was no fever or hypotension in this middle-aged woman. On exam, she was indeed breathing quickly and had a rapid, regular pulse, but there were clues beyond the vital signs as to the cause of her distress. Her eyes were as wide as her dilated pupils. Her skin was diaphoretic, and her feet tapped percussively on the tile floor.

SIGN UP\nAs an oncologist, I am also accustomed to framing danger in terms of proportions. In the calculus of difficult judgments, I try to demonstrate to my patients that the well-known side effects of chemotherapy are worth hazarding, presenting a risk\u2013benefit ratio that I hope will not seem unacceptably top-heavy. When administering cytotoxic drugs, I carry in my head a repository of percentages \u2014 a 37% chance of neutropenia with a certain combination regimen versus only a 13% chance when a single agent is deployed, for instance \u2014 whereas my patients are understandably less empirical. Their choices often stem from their amygdala, their fear center, more than any other part of their brain. And so theirs becomes a relative assessment of threats to their person. In the ledger of horrors, for them to proceed with myelosuppressive treatment, their natural revulsion to \u201cpoison\u201d must be superseded by their dread of an unopposed cancer.\nEvery patient\u2019s balance sheet looks different. For some, no chance of therapeutic benefit is too slim to lose its seductiveness, still enticing even when hope for a positive outcome looks razor-thin. In my career I have been astonished at how many patients have been willing to accept nearly inevitable toxicity for the vanishingly small possibility that they will be one of a select few \u201cexceptional responders.\u201d\nAt least, that is, until now. While the worldwide health community grapples with the novel contagion, the starkest end point in the outbreak has been the rising tally of lives claimed by Covid-19. As the deaths have mounted, it has also been common for the case fatality rate to be reported to the public; I have seen many patients under my care struggle to process that grim fraction in the context of all the other statistics I already cite to them. Chemotherapy, hardly desirable at the best of times, may never have been less appealing.\nAlthough this pandemic poses danger in the most global sense, certain subgroups appear particularly vulnerable to critical illness and death. Chinese investigators reported that patients with cancer affected by Covid-19 had a risk of the composite end point of invasive ventilation, admission to the intensive care unit, or death as high as five times that among patients without cancer.1 Even a remote history of cancer seemed to multiply the risk of severe events, possibly owing to protracted immunodeficiency,2 although that association may be correlative at best, and the increased risk might be more closely tied to older age.3 Confounding factors notwithstanding, most people with cancer, in comparing themselves with their healthy peers, perceive themselves as at greater risk from Covid-19, especially if they are actively undergoing therapy.\n\u201cAre we still friends?\u201d is the half-joking question I have long asked any patient to whom I\u2019ve administered chemotherapy for the first time. The initial treatment is instructive and clarifying for both of us. In the era of shared decision making, we commence treatment only after the hazy prophesying required for obtaining informed consent, in which I deliver a litany of potential outcomes before advising patients that, all things considered and in my professional medical opinion, they ought to sign on the dotted line. For all the gathering darkness, the future looks bright.\nHow different things can seem at our next encounter, ideally during a scheduled office visit but sometimes in the emergency department, on the hospital ward, or in the ICU. That laundry list of possibilities with which I deluged them at our previous appointment has now been narrowed, distilled into a present reality that might include intractable nausea, cholera-like diarrhea, or febrile neutropenia. Clouds have intruded on a sunny forecast, and it\u2019s time for the meteorologist to accept blame.\nInfection is not a new worry for the medical oncologist to consider in this dangerous balancing act between competing threats. One of my most indelibly tragic memories from fellowship was the admission of a young mother during her first cycle of dose-dense chemotherapy for breast cancer. Although she could not have looked more robust embarking on treatment, and despite prophylactic myeloid growth-factor support, her white cells plummeted to near-agranulocytosis and she became truly septic. She was admitted in multiorgan system failure and rapidly died while on vasopressors and a ventilator. Despite every best effort, I could not, in the end, rescue her at her nadir. It still haunts me.\nEach time I prescribe chemotherapy, the ethics lessons from my first year of medical school resound accusingly in my head: primum non nocere. To a student, it seemed a self-evident, easy morality (and didn\u2019t I sound sophisticated saying it in Latin?). But it turns out to be a precept that\u2019s extremely hard, if not impossible, for a medical oncologist to follow. I am a blunt instrument, and I cause collateral damage even when I take careful aim at an often elusive target inside a human being.\nPeople, including physicians, do not often stop to think how, exactly, cancer kills. They are aware of its often mortal ultimatum without considering the means to its ends. It is rare, for instance, that the primary tumor grows so large that its size alone proves fatal, although such a direct outcome is certainly possible in cases of, for example, a colon cancer obstructing the bowel. More often, the cause of death is the downstream derangement of physiology, or the exquisite vulnerabilities of immunosuppression, whether intrinsic or iatrogenic.\nMy queasy conscience now wrestles with the possibility of a bimodal peak of cancer patients dying: the imminent spike of those with decimated immunity falling victim to Covid-19 and the latent toll on those whose treatments were de-intensified, delayed, or canceled altogether. To survive SARS-CoV-2 only to then succumb to an undertreated cancer would be a Pyrrhic victory. The acuteness of infection and the chronicity of malignancy are the Scylla and Charybdis between which oncologists and their patients must now chart a very cautious course indeed.\nWhen I ask a patient who is undergoing chemotherapy whether we remain friends, it is a feint toward an admission of guilt. I recognize that our therapeutic alliance mirrors an abusive relationship: I inflict injury, I ask for forgiveness, I try to reestablish trust, and then I do it all over again. We even number the chemo treatments in cycles, reminding ourselves of time\u2019s circularity, the not-so-merry merry-go-round. Along another axis, their course can be seen as a roller coaster: a plunge into toxic effects, an ascent back to baseline, and then another precipitous decline. I learn each patient\u2019s pattern as I go, and I try to counsel accordingly. But will Covid-19 deepen the troughs to unfathomable lows? Only time will tell.\nDisclosure forms provided by the author are available at NEJM.org.\nThis article was published on April 7, 2020, at NEJM.org.\nAuthor Affiliations\nFrom the Department of Oncology, Intermountain Healthcare, Murray, UT.\nSupplementary Material\nDisclosure Forms PDF 61KB\nReferences (3)", "10.1056/NEJMp2005687": "5 References\nBecause of policies of mass incarceration over the past four decades, the United States has incarcerated more people than any other country on Earth. As of the end of 2016, there were nearly 2.2 million people in U.S. prisons and jails.1 People entering jails are among the most vulnerable in our society, and during incarceration, that vulnerability is exacerbated by restricted movement, confined spaces, and limited medical care. People caught up in the U.S. justice system have already been affected by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), and improved preparation is essential to minimizing the impact of this pandemic on incarcerated persons, correctional staff, and surrounding communities.\nPopulations involved with the criminal justice system have an increased prevalence of infectious diseases such as HIV and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections and tuberculosis. Disparities in social determinants of health affecting groups that are disproportionately likely to be incarcerated \u2014 racial minorities, persons who are unstably housed, persons with substance use disorders or mental illness \u2014 lead to greater concentrations of these illnesses in incarcerated populations. Yet implementation of interventions to address these conditions is often challenging in correctional settings owing to resource limitations and policy constraints. Therefore, comprehensive responses that straddle correctional facilities and the community often need to be devised.\nSign up for the Weekly Table of Contents email.\nEach week, receive an email with links to the articles published in the current week's issue of the New England Journal of Medicine. SIGN UP\nFor example, HCV, which is the most prevalent infectious disease in incarcerated populations, is most commonly spread through injection drug use. Transmission can be reduced using measures known to reduce high-risk behaviors, such as opioid agonist therapy and syringe exchange. Although much of the country has yet to implement these strategies in correctional settings, managing transitions in care to and from the community and providing such services to people after incarceration has a large impact. Similarly, we have learned that controlling infections such as HIV and HCV in correctional settings can have positive effects both in these settings and on surrounding communities, as a form of treatment as prevention.\nHighly transmissible novel respiratory pathogens pose a new challenge for incarcerated populations because of the ease with which they spread in congregate settings. Perhaps most relevant to the Covid-19 pandemic, the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic exposed the failure to include jails in planning efforts. By the spring of 2010, vaccine was plentiful, yet most small jails never received vaccine, despite the presence of high-risk persons, such as pregnant women, and the increased risk of transmission among unvaccinated persons who spent time detained in close proximity to one another.2\n\u201cSocial distancing\u201d is a strategy for reducing transmission and \u201cflattening the curve\u201d of cases entering the health care system. Although correctional facilities face risks similar to those of community health care systems, social distancing is extremely challenging in these settings. Furthermore, half of all incarcerated persons have at least one chronic disease,3 and according to the U.S. Department of Justice, 81,600 are over the age of 60, factors that increase the risk of poor outcomes of infection. With limited ability to protect themselves and others by self-isolating, hundreds of thousands of susceptible people are at heightened risk for severe illness.\nTo date, the Federal Bureau of Prisons and certain states and municipalities have opted to suspend visitation by community members, limit visits by legal representatives, and reduce facility transfers for incarcerated persons. To reduce social isolation and maintain a degree of connectedness for incarcerated people, some correctional systems are providing teleconferencing services for personal and legal visits. Irrespective of these interventions, infected persons \u2014 including staff members \u2014 will continue to enter correctional settings. By March 14, some U.S. correctional staff members had tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, and the first Covid-19 diagnosis in a detained person was announced on March 16. A recent SARS-CoV-2 outbreak among cruise-ship passengers and crew in Yokohama, Japan, provides a warning about what could soon happen in correctional settings.4\nTo operationalize a response for incarcerated populations, three levels of preparedness need to be addressed: the virus should be delayed as much as possible from entering correctional settings; if it is already in circulation, it should be controlled; and jails and prisons should prepare to deal with a high burden of disease. The better the mitigation job done by legal, public health, and correctional health partnerships, the lighter the burden correctional facilities and their surrounding communities will bear. We have learned from other epidemics, such as the 1918 influenza pandemic, that nonpharmaceutical interventions are effective, but they have the greatest impact when implemented early.5\nTherefore, we believe that we need to prepare now, by \u201cdecarcerating,\u201d or releasing, as many people as possible, focusing on those who are least likely to commit additional crimes, but also on the elderly and infirm; urging police and courts to immediately suspend arresting and sentencing people, as much as possible, for low-level crimes and misdemeanors; isolating and separating incarcerated persons who are infected and those who are under investigation for possible infection from the general prison population; hospitalizing those who are seriously ill; and identifying correctional staff and health care providers who became infected early and have recovered, who can help with custodial and care efforts once they have been cleared, since they may have some degree of immunity and severe staff shortages are likely.\nAll these interventions will help to flatten the curve of Covid-19 cases among incarcerated populations and limit the impact of transmission both inside correctional facilities and in the community after incarcerated people are released. Such measures will also reduce the burden on the correctional system in terms of stabilizing and transferring critically ill patients, as well as the burden on the community health care system to which such patients will be sent. Each person needlessly infected in a correctional setting who develops severe illness will be one too many.\nBeyond federal, state, and local action, we need to consider the impact of correctional facilities in the global context. The boundaries between communities and correctional institutions are porous, as are the borders between countries in the age of mass human travel. Despite security at nearly every nation\u2019s border, Covid-19 has appeared in practically all countries. We can\u2019t expect to find sturdier barriers between correctional institutions and their surrounding communities in any affected country. Thus far, we have witnessed a spectrum of epidemic responses from various countries when it comes to correctional institutions. Iran, for example, orchestrated the controlled release of more than 70,000 prisoners, which may help \u201cbend the curve\u201d of the Iranian epidemic. Conversely, failure to calm incarcerated populations in Italy led to widespread rioting in Italian prisons. Reports have also emerged of incarceration of exposed persons for violating quarantine, a practice that will exacerbate the very problem we are trying to mitigate. To respond to this global crisis, we need to consider prisons and jails as reservoirs that could lead to epidemic resurgence if the epidemic is not adequately addressed in these facilities everywhere.\nAs with general epidemic preparedness, the Covid-19 pandemic will teach us valuable lessons for preparedness in correctional settings. It will also invariably highlight the injustice and inequality in the United States that are magnified in the criminal justice system. As U.S. criminal justice reform continues to unfold, emerging communicable diseases and our ability to combat them need to be taken into account. To promote public health, we believe that efforts to decarcerate, which are already under way in some jurisdictions, need to be scaled up; and associated reductions of incarcerated populations should be sustained. The interrelation of correctional-system health and public health is a reality not only in the United States but around the world.\nDisclosure forms provided by the authors are available at NEJM.org.\nThis article was published on April 2, 2020, at NEJM.org.\nAuthor Affiliations\nFrom the Department of Medicine, Divisions of General Internal Medicine and Infectious Diseases, Albert Einstein College of Medicine and Montefiore Medical Center, Bronx, NY (M.J.A.); the Department of Epidemiology, Rollins School of Public Health, Emory University, Atlanta (A.C.S.); and the Departments of Medicine and Epidemiology, Division of Infectious Diseases, Brown University and the Miriam Hospital, Providence, RI (J.D.R.).\nSupplementary Material\nDisclosure Forms PDF 146KB\nReferences (5)", "10.1056/NEJMp2005492": "3 References\nA few weeks ago, Dr. D., a middle-aged chief of cardiology at one of the biggest hospitals in northern Italy, developed a fever. Fearing he might have Covid-19, he sought confirmatory testing but was told there weren\u2019t enough tests available for those who hadn\u2019t had demonstrated exposure to an infected person. He was therefore advised to stay home until the fever resolved. He returned to work 6 days later, but 5 days after that, a mild fever recurred, and soon he developed a cough. He again quarantined himself in the basement of his home so as not to expose his family.\nWith half his hospital\u2019s 1000 beds occupied by patients with Covid-19, Dr. D., who finally received a positive test result on March 10, knows he\u2019s fortunate. About 60 to 90 patients with symptoms suggestive of Covid-19 were presenting to his hospital\u2019s emergency department daily. Noninvasive ventilation was attempted in as many as possible, but the rapidity of respiratory deterioration in the most severely affected patients, including some young ones, was striking and often unforeseeable. \u201cYou have no predictive bible to help you,\u201d Dr. D. told me. This uncertainty only heightened the agony of the impossible decisions doctors were facing. \u201cWe have to decide who can go forward,\u201d he said.\nSign up for the Weekly Table of Contents email.\nEach week, receive an email with links to the articles published in the current week's issue of the New England Journal of Medicine. SIGN UP\nDr. D. was one of three physicians I spoke with who\u2019ve been caring for patients in northern Italy, which has borne the brunt of the country\u2019s thousands of confirmed coronavirus infections and, as of mid-March, more than 1000 deaths. Though the catastrophic nature of Lombardy\u2019s outbreak has since been widely publicized,1 when we spoke, all three requested anonymity, in accordance with the guidance they\u2019d been given. Dr. L., a staff doctor at a different hospital, had received a hospital memo forbidding press interviews so as to avoid causing further public alarm. Yet, as he emphasized, minimizing the gravity of the situation was having lethal consequences. \u201cThe citizens won\u2019t accept the restrictions,\u201d he said, \u201cunless you tell them the truth.\u201d\nThat truth is rather grim. Though Italy\u2019s health system is highly regarded and has 3.2 hospital beds per 1000 people (as compared with 2.8 in the United States), it has been impossible to meet the needs of so many critically ill patients simultaneously. Elective surgeries have been cancelled, semielective procedures postponed, and operating rooms turned into makeshift ICUs. With all beds occupied, corridors and administrative areas are lined with patients, some of them receiving noninvasive ventilation.\nHow to treat these patients? Beyond the ventilatory support for the severe interstitial pneumonias that develop, therapy is empirical, though lopinavir\u2013ritonavir, chloroquine, and sometimes high-dose steroids are all being tried.\nAnd how to care for patients presenting with unrelated illnesses? Though hospitals are attempting to create Covid-19 units, it\u2019s been difficult to protect other patients from exposure. Dr. D. told me, for instance, that at least five patients who\u2019d been admitted to his hospital for myocardial infarction were presumed to have been infected with Covid-19 while hospitalized.\nIf protecting patients is difficult, so is protecting health care workers, including nurses, respiratory therapists, and those tasked to clean the rooms between patients. When we spoke, Dr. D. was one of six physicians in his division to have suspected Covid-19 infection. Given testing lags and the proportion of infected people who remain asymptomatic, it\u2019s too soon to know the rate of infection among caregivers. And it is precisely these circumstances that make infection control so difficult. \u201cThe infection is everywhere in the hospital,\u201d Dr. D. told me. \u201cAlthough you wear protective gear and do the best you can, you cannot control it.\u201d\nThe challenge, he suggested, had less to do with caring for patients with Covid-19\u2013related critical illness, in whose rooms clinicians are shielded in protective gear, than with caregivers\u2019 many other daily activities: touching computers, riding elevators, seeing outpatients, eating lunch. Mandatory quarantine of infected workers, even those with mild illness, seems critical to infection control. But not all caregivers are equally vulnerable to severe illness, and workforce shortages will have to be managed somehow. One junior attending, Dr. S., told me that at his hospital young physicians were on the front lines, signing up for extra shifts and working outside their specialties. Nevertheless, he describes an eagerness among his senior colleagues to step up. \u201cYou can see the fear in their eyes,\u201d he said, \u201cbut they want to help.\u201d\nWhatever fears these caregivers may harbor about their own health, what they seemed to find far more unbearable was watching people die because resource constraints limited the availability of ventilatory support. So aversive was this rationing that they hesitated to describe how these decisions were being made. Dr. S. offered a hypothetical scenario involving two patients with respiratory failure, one 65 and the other 85 with coexisting conditions. With only one ventilator, you intubate the 65-year-old. Dr. D. told me his hospital was also considering, in addition to the number of comorbidities, the severity of respiratory failure and probability of surviving prolonged intubation, aiming to dedicate its limited resources to those who both stand to benefit most and have the highest chance of surviving.\nBut though approaches vary even within a single hospital, I sensed that age was often given the most weight. I heard one story, for instance, about an 80-year-old who was \u201cperfect physically\u201d until he developed Covid-19\u2013related respiratory failure. He died because mechanical ventilation could not be offered. Though Lombardy\u2019s richly resourced health care system has expanded critical care capacity as much as possible, there simply were not enough ventilators for all patients who needed them. \u201cThere is no way to find an exception,\u201d Dr. L. told me. \u201cWe have to decide who must die and whom we shall keep alive.\u201d\nContributing to the resource scarcity is the prolonged intubation many of these patients require as they recover from pneumonia \u2014 often 15 to 20 days of mechanical ventilation, with several hours spent in the prone position and then, typically, a very slow weaning. In the midst of the outbreak\u2019s peak in northern Italy, as physicians struggled to wean patients off ventilators while others developed severe respiratory decompensation, hospitals had to lower the age cutoff \u2014 from 80 to 75 at one hospital, for instance. Though the physicians I spoke with were clearly not responsible for the crisis in capacity, all seemed exquisitely uncomfortable when asked to describe how these rationing decisions were being made. My questions were met with silence \u2014 or the exhortation to focus solely on the need for prevention and social distancing. When I pressed Dr. S., for instance, about whether age-based cutoffs were being used to allocate ventilators, he eventually admitted how ashamed he was to talk about it. \u201cThis is not a nice thing to say,\u201d he told me. \u201cYou will just scare a lot of people.\u201d\nDr. S. was hardly alone. The agony of these decisions prompted several of the region\u2019s physicians to seek ethical counsel. In response, the Italian College of Anesthesia, Analgesia, Resuscitation, and Intensive Care (SIAARTI) issued recommendations under the direction of Marco Vergano, an anesthesiologist and chair of the SIAARTI\u2019s Ethics Section.2 Vergano, who worked on the recommendations between caring for critically ill patients in the ICU, said that the committee urged \u201cclinical reasonableness\u201d as well as what he called a \u201csoft utilitarian\u201d approach in the face of resource scarcity. Though the guidelines did not suggest that age should be the only factor determining resource allocation, the committee acknowledged that an age limit for ICU admission may ultimately need to be set.\nExplaining the recommendations\u2019 rationale, Vergano described how difficult it was for the frail and elderly to survive the prolonged intubation required to recover from Covid-19\u2013related pneumonia. As excruciating as it was to admit, about a week into the epidemic\u2019s peak, it became clear that ventilating patients who were extremely unlikely to survive meant denying ventilatory support to many who could. Nevertheless, even under the direst circumstances, rationing is often better tolerated when done silently. Indeed, the ethical guidance was widely criticized. Committee members were accused of ageism, and critics suggested that the gravity of the situation had been exaggerated and that Covid-19 was no worse than influenza.\nThough ethical dilemmas, by definition, have no right answer, if and when other health systems face similar rationing decisions, is societal backlash inevitable? To create an ethical framework for resource allocation reflecting society\u2019s priorities, Lee Biddison, an intensivist at Johns Hopkins, led focus groups around Maryland to discuss community members\u2019 preferences. The resultant document, published in 2019 and entitled \u201cToo Many Patients \u2026 A Framework to Guide Statewide Allocation of Scarce Mechanical Ventilation during Disasters\u201d \u2014 noting that \u201can influenza pandemic similar to that of 1918 would require ICU and mechanical ventilation capacity that is significantly greater than what is available\u201d \u2014 emphasizes ethical principles similar to those of the Italian committee.3\nParticipants seemed to value most saving people with the greatest chance of short-term survival, followed by saving those who, thanks to a relative lack of coexisting conditions, have the greatest chance of long-term survival. Though participants\u2019 input suggested that age should not be the primary or the sole criterion for resource allocation, people also recognized that there were circumstances under which \u201cit may be appropriate to consider stage of life in decision making.\u201d\nNo matter the ethical framework, should such resource scarcity occur, there are many scenarios that will still feel morally untenable, particularly in the face of heightened prognostic uncertainty. Would you remove a ventilator from one patient who was having a rocky course, for instance, to give it to another in the throes of an initial decompensation? Would you preferentially intubate a healthy 55-year-old over a young mother with breast cancer whose prognosis is unknown? In an effort to address such quandaries, Biddison and colleagues also offered three process-related principles that seemed as imperative as the ethical ones.\nThe first and most important is to separate clinicians providing care from those making triage decisions. The \u201ctriage officer,\u201d backed by a team with expertise in nursing and respiratory therapy, would make resource-allocation decisions and communicate them to the clinical team, the patient, and the family. Second, these decisions should be reviewed regularly by a centralized state-level monitoring committee to ensure that there are no inappropriate inequities. Third, the triage algorithm should also be reviewed regularly as knowledge about the disease evolves. If we decided not to intubate patients with Covid-19 for longer than 10 days, for example, but then learned that these patients need 15 days to recover, we would need to change our algorithms.\nUnifying all these principles, both ethical and pragmatic, is the recognition that only with transparency and inclusivity can public trust and cooperation be achieved. Around the world \u2014 from muzzled doctors in China, to false promises of testing capacity in the United States, to refutations of resource-rationing claims in Italy \u2014 we are seeing that denial is deadly. The point at which preparedness dissolves into panic will always be context-dependent. But the tragedy in Italy reinforces the wisdom of many public health experts: the best outcome of this pandemic would be being accused of having overprepared.\nDisclosure forms provided by the author are available at NEJM.org.\nThis article was published on March 18, 2020, at NEJM.org.\nAuthor Affiliations\nDr. Rosenbaum is a national correspondent for the Journal.\nSupplementary Material\nDisclosure Forms PDF 148KB\nReferences (3)", "10.1056/NEJMp2008512": "5 References\nThis August marks the 75th anniversary of the conclusion of World War II. In history\u2019s largest, most destructive war, an estimated 80 million people, or roughly 3% of the world population, died. Nearly 420,000 Americans were killed, and 670,000 were wounded. These grim numbers were mitigated, however, by an incalculable number of lives saved as a result of medical care. Many of the advances that were made would persist long after the war concluded \u2014 a silver lining that we hope will have parallels in our current struggle with Covid-19.\nA reductive argument that \u201cwar is good for medicine\u201d would minimize the horrific human cost of combat. Yet multiple scholars have highlighted how the urgency, aura of crisis, national attention, and material resources inherent in organized armed conflict have catalyzed developments in medicine and surgery.\nGeorge Washington successfully inoculated his army against smallpox, demonstrating the value and efficacy of that public health intervention. Walter Reed helped elucidate the epidemiology of typhoid and yellow fevers during the Spanish\u2013American War and its immediate aftermath, which led to effective control methods. Efforts to care for wounded veterans after World War I contributed to the rise and professionalization of physical and occupational therapy.\nBut the unprecedented scale and intensity of the Second World War created a particularly fertile environment for U.S. medical and surgical innovation. Moreover, whereas government involvement had generally dissipated after previous wars, World War II marked the commencement of a long-term, deeply integrated relationship between government and medicine that continues to shape the U.S. research agenda.\nThe story of penicillin, one of the war\u2019s most successful and best-known medical developments, highlights the involvement of the federal government in translational research.1 In 1928, British physician Alexander Fleming had noted by chance that the mold penicillium appeared to kill bacteria \u2014 a discovery that was publicized around the world but then lingered untapped for a decade. In 1941, the U.S. government, contacted by Oxford researchers Howard Florey and Norman Heatley and recognizing this drug\u2019s potential, sponsored a national effort to discover and implement a more efficient production system, an undertaking on the scale of the Manhattan Project. By D-Day in 1944, there was abundant penicillin for wounded soldiers, and by 1945, both service members overseas and civilians at home had ready access to the drug. The requisite scientists, laboratories, and production facilities would never have joined together in peacetime or through private industry alone. Other therapies, such as chloroquine and radioisotopes, have similar histories.\nIn addition to providing massive resources to stimulate innovation, the government leveraged its hierarchical chain of command to deliver and use new technologies at unprecedented scales, as exemplified by the proliferation of blood transfusions.2 The devastation of World War I had led to active investigation of shock, and research elucidated the crucial role of whole blood. Yet daunted by the logistics of supplying fresh blood to forces fighting across the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, the U.S. military in World War II initially relied on substitutes such as albumin. Publicly declaring the situation unacceptable in a widely read 1943 New York Times article, Edward Churchill, the chief surgical consultant for the Mediterranean theater of operations, helped transition the military to blood-based resuscitation. This switch required a herculean logistical effort in the United States to collect, type, and transfer blood to far-flung military hospitals. By war\u2019s end, fresh whole blood was widely available to U.S. casualties.\nThe ability to alter practice by fiat and the organization required for implementing such developments globally and rapidly similarly advanced the surgical management of colon injuries and psychiatric care for battle fatigue, among other examples. And such changes endured long after the war. Before the war, for instance, blood banks were uncommon and chiefly local affairs, serving the needs of individual institutions. The processes institutionalized in World War II, with the American Red Cross assuming a leadership role, ultimately led to a network of blood banks in a decentralized yet national system that effectively supplied communities throughout the country with needed blood.\nWorld War II also fundamentally transformed health care provision nationwide. By rewarding physicians\u2019 board certification with rank and pay, the military catalyzed medical specialization in post-war America. Equally important, it remade the Veterans Administration (VA; now Veterans Affairs) hospital system.3 Whereas the VA had previously focused on patients with tuberculosis and mental illness, after the war, it came to manage a range of acute and chronic conditions. Increasingly affiliated with academic medical centers in the 1950s, VA hospitals proliferated and broadened their capabilities to create a functionally parallel, government-run health care system that now treats approximately 10 million veterans per year.\nThe war similarly stimulated the expansion of private health insurance. During a 4-year wage freeze, U.S. companies began attracting employees by offering health insurance \u2014 a previously rare benefit that brought coverage to millions of workers and their dependents and fundamentally reshaped the delivery of health care in this country.\nThe government\u2019s involvement in medical research outlasted the war. Before the 1940s, the federal government had had little interest in or influence on medicine during peacetime; what minimal research funding existed came from private sources. Today, the National Institutes of Health alone provides about $41.7 billion in annual research support. In recent years, the U.S. military has separately spent about $50 billion per year on health care, including $2 billion on research \u2014 accounting for a sizable percentage of the national research budget.4 Although much of this attention is focused on military concerns such as trauma, in other arenas, such as antimalarial drugs and cold injury, the military has led investigative efforts decades after civilian attention has faded. Just as a military\u2013industrial complex arose in the 1950s, a parallel military\u2013medical complex emerged that leveraged the Cold War\u2019s quasi-wartime footing to marshal significant resources and shape the evolution of U.S. medicine.\nFor the past few months, the world has been dealing with another global crisis, the Covid-19 pandemic. Politicians, clinicians, and the public have been quick to draw analogies with war, describing a \u201cbattle\u201d against an \u201cunseen enemy,\u201d led by a \u201cwartime president.\u201d War and pandemics clearly differ. Attention during a pandemic focuses on a single disease rather than on the myriad medical problems created by warfare. Commercial interests and personal freedoms vie with public health considerations, without regard for the imperative of military victory. An unruly, disorganized, international mass of civilians account for the bulk of patients, and they are treated in independent health systems that don\u2019t coordinate with one another and thus lack the benefits that a martial command structure provides. Moreover, such comparisons can have unfortunate, unintended social consequences, such as alienation of people seen as \u201cothers\u201d and compromise of safety standards for the sake of efficiency.5\nYet Covid-19 has also prompted a governmental response similar to that seen during wartime, characterized by a large influx of resources and attention. Legislatures have allocated trillions of dollars to fund direct and indirect means of stemming the spread of disease. Clinical trials are being expedited, and therapies are being adopted much more readily than under normal conditions \u2014 with less reliable data to validate them. The Defense Production Act, intended for times of armed conflict, is being used to mandate repurposing of industrial facilities for ventilator production.\nIn 75 years, it will be intriguing to reflect on the lingering effects of Covid-19 and our response to it. Certainly, it seems already to have normalized telehealth in previously unimaginable ways. We hope that it will also lead to the development of a more equitable infrastructure for health care delivery. History has proven that as the threat of a war or pandemic fades, interest and resource investment also decline. Yet for all their common horror, these events also have analogous potential to catalyze and reconfigure development in medicine and public health. Such moments of shared crisis merit reflection as we consider our collective medical and social priorities and interventions moving forward.\nDisclosure forms provided by the authors are available at NEJM.org.\nThis article was published on April 29, 2020, at NEJM.org.\nAuthor Affiliations\nFrom the Department of Surgery, Duke University, Durham, NC (J.B.); and the Department of Global Health and Social Medicine, Harvard Medical School, and the Center for the History of Medicine, Countway Medical Library \u2014 both in Boston (S.H.P.).\nSupplementary Material\nDisclosure Forms PDF 75KB\nReferences (5)", "10.1056/NEJMp2009405": "5 References\nHow long will this pandemic last? When will we find a treatment or vaccine? Which drug should we give our patients? Will we run out of personal protective equipment (PPE)? When will everyone return to work? We find ourselves in a time of great economic, social, and medical uncertainty. Faced with a crisis, Lee Iacocca, the late automobile company executive, once said, \u201cSo what do we do? Anything. Something\u2026 . If we screw it up, start over. Try something else. If we wait until we\u2019ve satisfied all the uncertainties, it may be too late.\u201d Similarly, in the heat of the Great Depression, Franklin Roosevelt commented, \u201cTake a method and try it. If it fails, admit it frankly and try another. But by all means, try something.\u201d Though a trial-and-error approach may be appropriate in business and politics, should it be applied to medical decision making during a pandemic?\nEven as we acknowledge that the world now feels strange and that doctors are susceptible to human anxieties, we should remember to accept uncertainty rationally and beware of potential undesirable consequences of our instinctive desire to see patterns in what may be random happenstance. Our mission as healers, in a situation such as the Covid-19 pandemic, makes us feel compelled to do something. As doctors trained in the scientific method, however, we are committed to practicing evidence-based medicine, which is premised on the ability to interpret scientific reports on supposed diagnostic and therapeutic advances. We need to retain a healthy skepticism and remember the principle of clinical equipoise, particularly when considering interventions that could cause harm.1 Otherwise, in our effort to \u201cdo good\u201d for our patients, we may fall prey to cognitive biases and therapeutic errors.2\nSign up for the Weekly Table of Contents email.\nEach week, receive an email with links to the articles published in the current week's issue of the New England Journal of Medicine. SIGN UP\nUnder conditions of information overload and uncertainty-related anxiety, we have an increased tendency to inappropriately favor recently acquired information because of its ease of recall \u2014 a heuristic known as availability bias.3 We might think, \u201cI spoke to a colleague in Italy yesterday who told me she had a patient whose oxygenation problem was due to clots in the lung,\u201d leading us to decide, \u201cI\u2019m going to give thrombolytics now.\u201d\nSimilarly, our sense of urgency about doing something may increase our likelihood of anchoring3 \u2014 closing our decision-making process prematurely, before exploring reasonable alternatives: \u201cThe patient has had three negative tests for coronavirus, but I don\u2019t care \u2014 I\u2019m sure that\u2019s what she has.\u201d\nAnd confirmation bias causes us to focus on information that reinforces our preconceived notions at the expense of contradictory information. We see a patient with hypotension and a reduced ejection fraction on echocardiography and presume he has Covid-19\u2013related cardiomyopathy, despite his focal ECG abnormalities and history of coronary disease.\nIn a time when the rational\u2013emotional scale is tipping to the emotional side, we begin relying more heavily on anecdotes, particularly personal experiences that may carry inordinate weight in our minds. Journalists use the power of stories to connect with readers and tug at their emotions. Physicians, trained as scientists, are expected to follow a hypothesis-driven, rational, evidence-based approach to clinical decision making, but we, too, can be swayed by stories under the pressures of a crisis.\nThroughout the world, therapeutic management for SARS-CoV-2 has largely been supportive, and to date, no specific therapy has been scientifically proven to reduce mortality. Physicians are treating patients, with unsparing generosity, using medications such as chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, lopinavir\u2013ritonavir, and interleukin-6 inhibitors outside their indicated, approved uses and without study protocols, with little scientific evidence supporting their administration beyond extrapolation from in vitro studies revealing their antiviral and antiinflammatory properties.4 Aside from the potential side effects of drugs such as hydroxychloroquine and interleukin-6 inhibitors, which include fatal cardiac arrhythmias and possible worsening of infection, respectively,4 prescribing medications on the basis of case reports does little to help advance science or our ability to combat future recurrences of coronavirus.\nFurthermore, the intense desire to try new, unproven remedies may distract health care providers from offering patients the best-quality supportive care possible. Evidence on palliative care in oncology, which in some advanced cancers is associated with longer life than intensive therapies, clarifies the value of focused supportive care. Recent survival rates among U.S. patients with respiratory failure due to Covid-19 appear better than those in early reports, possibly because we are paying greater attention to the basics of care for acute respiratory distress syndrome. Only recently have randomized, controlled trials of therapeutic interventions for Covid-19 been launched.4 The \u201cwhat do you have to lose?\u201d approach, a common plea of desperate families, must be balanced by the dictum of the Hippocratic Oath: first, do no harm.\nCausing harm in our efforts to do something is not unprecedented. According to a systematic review of treatment effects in the last coronavirus (SARS-CoV) outbreak in 2003, four studies identified ribavirin as causing possible harm to infected patients.5 More than one third of patients treated with ribavirin developed hemolytic anemia, but the absence of a control group precluded ruling out the possibility that the infection itself caused this complication. Even more alarming, of the 29 studies of steroid use, 25 were inconclusive: in many cases, because of inconsistent reporting or lack of a control group, the study provided no conclusions regarding treatment efficacy, and 4 studies suggested possible harm.5 The thirst for a treatment in an uncertain time led to flawed studies that may have contributed to negative physical, social, and economic consequences.\nDespite the temptation to provide hope by using untested remedies, we should instead push for studies designed to meet the standards necessary to reach reasonable conclusions about efficacy5 \u2014 an admittedly difficult task during a crisis. We are now engaged, for example, in a blinded, randomized, controlled trial of remdesivir, a new antiviral, as well as a drug that inhibits the action of interleukin-6, but we have been resisting pleas to communicate anecdotes of success; we push back because that is not how science is done.\nAnxiety and fear of contagion despite evidence that PPE use is effective may also alter care. Though clinicians have become infected with SARS-CoV-2, it\u2019s often unclear whether the infection was attributable to a work exposure or a contact outside the hospital; up to this point rates of infection among health care workers do not appear to differ between those who work on units with Covid-positive patients and those who don\u2019t. Yet some clinical consultations are being conducted without the consultant speaking to or examining the patient. Procedures are being delayed or deferred on the basis of extrapolation from anecdotes about possible exposure.\nOne of us (R.M.S.) began his career at the beginning of the AIDS epidemic. Nobody knew exactly how the disease was transmitted, and it was universally fatal; anxiety among doctors and nurses was high. Nevertheless, with precautions, we had to perform surgeries, bronchoscopies, and other invasive procedures. Emotional reactions are understandable, but we need to call on reason if we are to do our jobs effectively.\nThus far in the Covid-19 pandemic, we\u2019ve observed that therapeutic management has often been initiated and altered on the basis of individual case reports and physician opinion, rather than of randomized trials. In these uncertain times, physicians fall prey to cognitive error and unconsciously rely on limited experiences, whether their own or others\u2019, instead of scientific inquiry. We believe that physicians should be acting in concert with clinical equipoise. We should be skeptical of any purported therapeutic strategy until enough statistical evidence is gathered that would convince any \u201copen-minded clinician informed of the results\u201d that one treatment is superior to another.1\nWe are living through an unprecedented biopsychosocial crisis; physicians must be the voice of reason and lead by example. We must reason critically and reflect on the biases that may influence our thinking processes, critically appraise evidence in deciding how to treat patients, and use anecdotal observations only to generate hypotheses for trials that can be conducted with clinical equipoise.

That day, as we sat crowded together around a small conference table \u2014 how quaint this seems now \u2014 I passed out copies of William Carlos Williams\u2019s poem \u201cComplaint.\u201d Published in 1921, the poem features a doctor who is summoned late one snowy night to the home of a woman who may be in labor. Williams, a physician himself, begins, \u201cThey call me and I go.\u201d\nSign up for the Weekly Table of Contents email.\nEach week, receive an email with links to the articles published in the current week's issue of the New England Journal of Medicine. SIGN UP\nI invited the group to explore the various emotions we clinicians feel when we\u2019re summoned urgently by pager, bedside call bell, electronic message, or telephone to care for a patient. We generated an impressively varied list: pride, annoyance, curiosity, apprehension, gratitude, exasperation, and joy. Some reflected that at times we experience all of these. On one thing we agreed: like the doctor in \u201cComplaint\u201d who heads out into the cold and dark, no matter what we feel, when we\u2019re called, we go.\nExcept barely 2 weeks later the call came for me, and my first reaction was to ignore it. Because of the coronavirus pandemic, like many of my colleagues I was working from home. I\u2019d settled into an easy chair in my living room with my laptop to refill prescriptions when I received an email message requesting volunteers to work in a clinic that had just been created to evaluate patients with coughs, fevers, and other possible symptoms of Covid-19. I am nearing the end of my career, and I regarded this request the same way I view announcements about proposed IT updates: with the sense that it didn\u2019t really apply to me. Plus, I knew that because of my age, if I contracted coronavirus I\u2019d be at higher risk for complications. I wouldn\u2019t be much help to anyone if I ended up in the ICU. I\u2019d be more useful, I reasoned, managing my patients\u2019 care remotely, continuing to facilitate discussion groups by videoconference, and cheering on my younger colleagues.\nOver the next 48 hours, though, I paced around my house uneasily, as if I had a pebble in my shoe. When the pebble became a rock, I decided that I needed to volunteer for the new clinic, that I couldn\u2019t live with myself if I didn\u2019t.\nIf this sounds brave, I don\u2019t mean it to. I am not a brave person. As a child I hated recess. The school playground frightened me: the monkey bars were too high, the slide too slippery, the swing too\u2026swingy. As an adult I\u2019m no more physically courageous. If I were to respond to the challenge currently circulating on social media \u2014 \u201cname five things you don\u2019t like that other people like\u201d \u2014 I\u2019d put air travel, roller coasters, and skiing, all of which terrify me, as the top three, with bleu cheese and science fiction coming in at four and five. Still, in the hours after the message about the Covid-19 screening clinic arrived, I felt that however much I feared for my physical safety, the psychological distress I\u2019d feel if I didn\u2019t volunteer would be far greater.\nWhere did this feeling come from? Medical school. Part of the curriculum, no less essential than anatomy and physiology, was the teaching that physicians do not turn away from human suffering. Others may avoid the sickly smell of bloody stool, the sight of a festering wound, the sounds of a grieving parent\u2019s wails \u2014 but not us. This is the doctor\u2019s and nurse\u2019s equivalent of the firefighter running into a burning building.\nUnlike firefighters, health care workers usually do not put our own lives in jeopardy, though of course, many have during wars, during outbreaks of contagious diseases, and in other perilous circumstances. Often the cost of responding to the demands of patient care is relatively small compared with its rewards. I learned this lesson 30 years ago, when I started in practice. My first weekend on call, I was paired with a mentor, a beloved veteran internist in my group. I was certain I\u2019d need his assistance, given that I was new to the hospital and not yet confident in my outpatient skills, since my training had been heavily inpatient-oriented. But the weekend went smoothly, and by Sunday night I was in my pajamas, ready to turn in, and rather pleased with myself. That\u2019s when my pager went off.\nMs. B., a woman in her 50s who\u2019d been assigned to be my patient and whom I\u2019d not yet met, was in the emergency department, having survived a suicide attempt. She\u2019d be transferred to a psychiatric hospital once she was medically stable. I hung up the phone and turned out the light, but I couldn\u2019t sleep. I dialed my mentor\u2019s number and, after apologizing for phoning him so late, asked if I should go to the ED. \u201cWell,\u201d he said, \u201cyou don\u2019t have to, but every time I\u2019ve felt I should see a patient, it ended up being the right thing to do.\u201d\nI got dressed and drove downtown to the hospital where I found Ms. B. lying on a gurney in the emergency department. I introduced myself, and she nodded sleepily. The doctor who\u2019d paged me appeared puzzled as to why I\u2019d responded in person to what was essentially an FYI. I felt foolish, realizing that Ms. B. wouldn\u2019t even remember that I\u2019d been there.\nBut she did remember. Over the next 20 years, Ms. B. frequently mentioned how much my presence had meant to her that night. She moved away a while ago and recently died of breast cancer. Her husband called to tell me the news, saying she would have wanted me to know. I might no longer have been her \u201cprovider,\u201d he said, but I\u2019d always been her doctor. I have no doubt that I earned this honor in large part because I\u2019d shown up that night. That reflex to show up, instilled in me so long ago, must explain why I retrieved the email about the Covid-19 clinic 2 days after I deleted it.\nIt isn\u2019t so scary after all. Unlike many less fortunate facilities, our clinic is well organized, well staffed, and well equipped. My colleagues\u2019 banter and the determination evident even behind their goggles and masks calm my jangling nerves. Camaraderie and singularity of purpose, it turns out, are highly effective anxiolytics.\nI understand that I\u2019m not taking anything like the risks many of my colleagues are taking, especially those treating patients in ICUs and EDs; health workers who lack adequate protective gear; doctors and nurses older than I am who\u2019ve come out of retirement to serve; pregnant clinicians and residents working long hours with repeated exposures to patients infected with the virus. I recognize, too, that because of their own medical conditions or family situations, some health workers are unable to care for patients with Covid-19. And I also know something about myself that I didn\u2019t know even a few weeks ago: that as averse to risk as I am by nature, I would take on more if called to do so. The sentiments expressed by a character in The Plague, a novel by Albert Camus that I first read in high school, are no longer abstract to me: \u201cI have no idea what\u2019s awaiting me, or what will happen when this all ends,\u201d says Dr. Rieux. \u201cFor the moment I know this: there are sick people and they need curing.\u201d\nDisclosure forms provided by the author are available at NEJM.org.\nThis article was published on April 13, 2020, at NEJM.org.\nAuthor Affiliations\nFrom Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston.\nSupplementary Material\nDisclosure Forms PDF 51KB", "10.1056/NEJMp2002125": "5 References\n55 Citing Articles\nLetters\nThe epidemic of 2019 novel coronavirus (now called SARS-CoV-2, causing the disease Covid-19) has expanded from Wuhan throughout China and is being exported to a growing number of countries, some of which have seen onward transmission. Early efforts have focused on describing the clinical course, counting severe cases, and treating the sick. Experience with the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), pandemic influenza, and other outbreaks has shown that as an epidemic evolves, we face an urgent need to expand public health activities in order to elucidate the epidemiology of the novel virus and characterize its potential impact. The impact of an epidemic depends on the number of persons infected, the infection\u2019s transmissibility, and the spectrum of clinical severity.\nThus, several questions are especially critical. First, what is the full spectrum of disease severity (which can range from asymptomatic, to symptomatic-but-mild, to severe, to requiring hospitalization, to fatal)?\nSign up for the Weekly Table of Contents email.\nEach week, receive an email with links to the articles published in the current week's issue of the New England Journal of Medicine. SIGN UP\nSecond, how transmissible is the virus?\nThird, who are the infectors \u2014 how do the infected person\u2019s age, the severity of illness, and other characteristics of a case affect the risk of transmitting the infection to others? Of vital interest is the role that asymptomatic or presymptomatic infected persons play in transmission. When and for how long is the virus present in respiratory secretions?\nAnd fourth, what are the risk factors for severe illness or death? And how can we identify groups most likely to have poor outcomes so that we can focus prevention and treatment efforts?\nTypes of Evidence Needed for Controlling an Epidemic.\nThe table lists approaches to answering these questions, each of which has shown success in prior disease outbreaks, especially MERS and pandemic H1N1 influenza.1\nCounting the number of cases, including mild cases, is necessary to calibrate the epidemic response. Conventional wisdom dictates that the sickest people seek care and undergo testing; early in an epidemic, case fatality and hospitalization ratios are often used to assess impact. These measures should be interpreted with caution, since it may take time for cases to become severe, or for infected persons to die, and it may not be possible to accurately estimate the denominator of infected people in order to calculate those ratios.2 As in past epidemics, the first cases of Covid-19 to be observed in China were severe enough to come to medical attention and result in testing, but the total number of people infected has been elusive. The estimated case fatality ratio among medically attended patients thus far is approximately 2%, but the true ratio may not be known for some time.2\nSimple counts of the number of confirmed cases can be misleading indicators of the epidemic\u2019s trajectory if these counts are limited by problems in access to care or bottlenecks in laboratory testing, or if only patients with severe cases are tested. During the 2009 influenza pandemic, an approach was described for maintaining surveillance when cases become too numerous to count. This approach, which can be adapted to Covid-19, involves using existing surveillance systems or designing surveys to ascertain each week the number of persons with a highly sensitive but nonspecific syndrome (for example, acute respiratory infection) and testing a subset of these persons for the novel coronavirus. The product of the incidence of acute respiratory infection (for example) and the percent testing positive provides an estimate of the burden of cases in a given jurisdiction.3 Now is the time to put in place the infrastructure to accomplish such surveillance. Electronic laboratory reporting will dramatically improve the efficiency of this and other public health studies involving viral testing.\nMore generally, it is useful to synthesize data from simultaneous surveillance studies, epidemiologic field investigations, and case series.1 Conducting cohort studies in well-defined settings such as schools, workplaces, or neighborhoods (community surveys) can help in describing the overall burden and the household and community attack rate; perhaps most important, it can permit rapid assessment of the severity of the epidemic by counting the number of illnesses, hospitalizations, and deaths in a well-defined population and extrapolating that rate to the larger population.4 Understanding transmissibility remains crucial for predicting the course of the epidemic and the likelihood of sustained transmission. Several groups have estimated the basic reproductive number R0 of SARS-CoV-2 using epidemic curves, but household studies can be superior sources of data on the timing and probability of transmission and may be useful in estimation of R0.5\nHousehold studies can also help define the role that subclinical, asymptomatic, and mild infections play in transmission to inform evidence-based decisions about prioritization of control measures; measures that depend on identification and isolation of symptomatic persons will be far more effective if those persons have the primary role in transmission. On the other hand, if persons without symptoms can transmit the virus, more emphasis should be placed on measures for social distancing, such as closing schools and avoiding mass gatherings. To evaluate whether the risks that school closure poses to children\u2019s well-being and education \u2014 and to productivity if working parents are needed for child care \u2014 are justified, we must learn whether children are an important source of transmission. Household studies can also be used to conduct viral shedding studies that can help determine when patients are most infectious and for how long they should be isolated.\nA key point of these recommendations is that viral testing should not be used only for clinical care. A proportion of testing capacity must be reserved to support public health efforts to characterize the trajectory and severity of the disease. Although this approach may result in many negative test results and therefore appear \u201cwasteful,\u201d such set-aside capacity will permit a far clearer understanding of the spread of the epidemic and wiser use of resources to combat it. Testing in unexplained clusters or severe cases of acute respiratory infections, regardless of a patient\u2019s travel history, may be a sensitive way to screen for chains of transmission that may have been missed. Such findings are relevant particularly in light of evidence that even Singapore, with one of the world\u2019s best public health systems, has found cases that have so far not been linked to known cases or to Chinese travel. If such undetected introductions are happening in Singapore, it is prudent to expect they are happening elsewhere as well.\nEarly investments in characterizing SARS-CoV-2 will pay off handsomely in improving the epidemic response. If sustained transmission takes off outside China, as many experts expect, the urgency of the epidemic will necessitate choices about which interventions to employ, under which circumstances, and for how long. Starting these epidemiologic and surveillance activities promptly will enable us to choose the most efficient ways of controlling the epidemic and help us avoid interventions that may be unnecessarily costly or unduly restrictive of normal activity.\nMany urban centers in China are or will soon be overwhelmed with the treatment of severe cases. It may be difficult for many of them to perform the kinds of studies described here. One exception is systematic surveys of persons who are not suspected to have Covid-19 or who have mild respiratory illness, to assess whether they are currently subclinically infected (viral testing), have been infected previously (serologic testing), or both. These studies, which will inform estimates of the severity spectrum, will be most informative in the settings that have the most cases.\nFortunately, the numbers of detected cases outside China remain manageable for public health authorities \u2014 and too small for the conduct of such studies. But it is vital for jurisdictions outside mainland China to prepare to perform these studies as case numbers grow.\nDisclosure forms provided by the authors are available at NEJM.org.\nThis article was published on February 19, 2020, at NEJM.org.\nAuthor Affiliations\nFrom the Center for Communicable Disease Dynamics, Department of Epidemiology, Harvard T.H.

We rely on quarantine, isolation, and infection-control measures to prevent disease spread and on supportive care for those who become ill. What we lack is a specific antiviral agent to treat the infected and, optimally, decrease viral shedding and subsequent transmission.\nOne antiviral-drug candidate is a combination of the HIV protease inhibitors lopinavir and ritonavir. Lopinavir, which acts against the viral 3CL protease, has modest antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2.1 Together with ritonavir, which increases drug bioavailability, it is in clinical trials, along with the immunomodulator interferon beta-1b, for the treatment of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT02845843\n. opens in new tab\n).

But does it work?\nSign up for the Weekly Table of Contents email.\nEach week, receive an email with links to the articles published in the current week's issue of the New England Journal of Medicine. SIGN UP\nThis is the question that motivated Cao and colleagues to perform an urgent randomized clinical trial of the efficacy of lopinavir\u2013ritonavir in patients with Covid-19 in Wuhan, China, the epicenter of the outbreak.2 On January 18, the first patient was enrolled in this open-label trial, about a week after SARS-CoV-2 had been identified and sequenced. The investigators recruited patients who had an oxygen saturation of 94% or less while they were breathing ambient air or a ratio of the partial pressure of oxygen to the fraction of inspired oxygen of less than 300 mm Hg and who were receiving a range of ventilatory support modes, from nothing to mechanical ventilation or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). Enrollment was stratified according to the severity of illness as indicated by the level of ventilatory support administered. All the patients received standard care, and half were randomly assigned to receive lopinavir\u2013ritonavir for 14 days. The primary end point was the time to clinical improvement, defined as the time from randomization to either discharge from the hospital or improvement on a multifactorial set of prespecified criteria, whichever came first. The trial aimed to enroll 160 patients.\nThis was a heroic effort. Health care workers in Hubei province have provided patient care in an overwhelming epidemic while they themselves are one of the highest risk groups for development of disease. As we saw during the 2014 Ebola outbreak in West Africa, obtaining high-quality clinical trial data to guide the care of patients is extremely difficult in the face of an epidemic, and the feasibility of a randomized design has been called into question.3 Yet Cao\u2019s group of determined investigators not only succeeded but ended up enrolling a larger number of patients (199) than originally targeted.\nUnfortunately, the trial results were disappointing. No benefit was observed in the primary end point of time to clinical improvement: both groups required a median of 16 days. But the results for certain secondary end points are intriguing. A slightly lower number of deaths was seen in the lopinavir\u2013ritonavir group, although this observation is difficult to interpret, given the small numbers and the fact that the standard-care group appears to have been sicker at baseline. Removing deaths in the lopinavir\u2013ritonavir group that occurred after randomization but before the first dose of drug was given would provide a more encouraging result, but such a change is debatable, since no such removal occurred in the control group. On the other hand, the trial was an open-label one, and since the end points were being evaluated or influenced by clinicians who were aware of treatment assignment, they were susceptible to potential bias. It is important to note that both groups were heterogeneous and received various additional treatments, including other pharmacologic interventions such as interferon (11%) and glucocorticoids (34%).\nThe secondary end points provide both reason for hope and reason for discouragement. The number of deaths was somewhat lower in the group that received lopinavir\u2013ritonavir. Tellingly, though, there was no discernible effect on viral shedding. Since the drug is supposed to act as a direct inhibitor of viral replication, the inability to suppress the viral load and the persistent detection of viral nucleic acid strongly suggest that it did not have the activity desired. Thus, although some effect of the drug is possible, it was not easily observed.\nWhy isn\u2019t lopinavir\u2013ritonavir more effective? Two major factors may be in play. First, the authors chose a particularly challenging population. The patients recruited for the study were late in infection and already had considerable tissue damage (as evidenced by compromised lung function and 25% mortality in the control group). Even highly active antibacterial agents have limited efficacy in advanced bacterial pneumonia. Second, lopinavir simply isn\u2019t particularly potent against SARS-CoV-2. The concentration necessary to inhibit viral replication is relatively high as compared with the serum levels found in patients treated with lopinavir\u2013ritonavir.1,4 We currently know little about drug concentrations in the tissues where SARS-CoV-2 is replicating.\nThe fact that this trial began within days after the virus was identified and that testing for infection was developed and deployed very rapidly means that test characteristics had not been fully defined. Notably, 35% of those who screened positive for SARS-CoV-2 by nasopharyngeal swab then tested negative at the day 1 visit by oropharyngeal swab. Was this due to differences in site of assessment, time of illness, testing characteristics, or just the natural evolution of the disease? In addition, 42% of the patients were viral load\u2013positive at day 28, but the quantitative data at that point show that the levels were low, probably near the threshold of detection. Since the test detects nucleic acid, positive results do not necessarily indicate the production of infectious virus. These data suggest that assessing transmissibility after recovery from severe disease will be a priority to help control transmission.\nDespite the fact that lopinavir\u2013ritonavir does not seem to be highly effective in patients with Covid-19, there are many important takeaways from this study. The investigators appropriately prioritized speed, designing a trial that could rapidly produce an answer. What we\u2019ve learned from their work can help inform the design of new trials. And it is clear that rapidly initiated, high-quality randomized clinical trials are possible in epidemic conditions, even in the trying circumstances that prevailed in Wuhan. The results of such trials, providing either convincing positive or convincing negative findings, will be central to clinical care as the dangerous coronavirus outbreak continues.\nDisclosure forms provided by the authors are available with the full text of this editorial at NEJM.org.\nThis editorial was published on March 18, 2020, at NEJM.org.\nSupplementary Material\nDisclosure Forms PDF 156KB\nReferences (4)\nCiting Articles (19)", "10.1056/NEJMp2002106": "5 References\n10 Citing Articles\nThe 1918 influenza pandemic was the deadliest event in human history (50 million or more deaths, equivalent in proportion to 200 million in today\u2019s global population). For more than a century, it has stood as a benchmark against which all other pandemics and disease emergences have been measured. We should remember the 1918 pandemic as we deal with yet another infectious-disease emergency: the growing epidemic of novel coronavirus infectious disease (Covid-19), which is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). This virus has been spreading throughout China for at least 2 months, has been exported to at least 36 other countries, and has been seeding more than two secondary cases for every primary case. The World Health Organization has declared the epidemic a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. If public health efforts cannot control viral spread, we will soon be witnessing the birth of a fatal global pandemic.\nThe Greek myth of Pandora\u2019s box (actually a pithos, or jar) comes to mind: the gods had given Pandora a locked jar she was never to open.

SIGN UP\nOf course, scientists tell us that SARS-CoV-2 did not escape from a jar: RNA sequences closely resemble those of viruses that silently circulate in bats, and epidemiologic information implicates a bat-origin virus infecting unidentified animal species sold in China\u2019s live-animal markets. We have recently seen many such emerging zoonoses, including the 2003 bat-coronavirus\u2013derived SARS (an earlier severe acute respiratory syndrome, caused by a closely related coronavirus), which came terrifyingly close to causing a deadly global pandemic that was prevented only by swift global public health actions and luck.1 Now, 17 years later, we stand at a similar precipice. How did we get to this point, and what happens next?\nWe must realize that in our crowded world of 7.8 billion people, a combination of altered human behaviors, environmental changes, and inadequate global public health mechanisms now easily turn obscure animal viruses into existential human threats.1-3 We have created a global, human-dominated ecosystem that serves as a playground for the emergence and host-switching of animal viruses, especially genetically error-prone RNA viruses, whose high mutation rates have, for millions of years, provided opportunities to switch to new hosts in new ecosystems. It took the genome of the human species 8 million years to evolve by 1%. Many animal RNA viruses can evolve by more than 1% in a matter of days. It is not difficult to understand why we increasingly see the emergence of zoonotic viruses.\nWe have actually been watching such dramas play out in slow motion for more than a millennium in the case of pandemic influenza, which begins with viruses of wild waterfowl that host-switch to humans and then cause human-to-human transmission. A bird virus thereby becomes a human virus. Coronavirus emergence takes a different trajectory, but the principles are similar: SARS, the Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (MERS), and Covid-19 all apparently have their origins in enzootic bat viruses. The parallels between the two SARS viruses are striking, including emergence from bats to infect animals sold in live-animal markets, allowing direct viral access to crowds of humans, which exponentially increases opportunities for host-switching. Such live markets have also led to avian epizootics with fatal human \u201cspillover\u201d cases caused by nonpandemic, poultry-adapted influenza viruses such as H5N1 and H7N9. One human cultural practice in one populous country has thus recently led to two coronavirus near-pandemics and thousands of severe and fatal international cases of \u201cbird flu.\u201d\nBut these are not the only examples of deadly viral emergences associated with human behaviors.2 HIV emerged from primates and was spread across Africa by truck routes and sexual practices. The origin of Ebola remains uncertain, but in 2014\u20132016 the virus spread explosively in West Africa in association with fear and secrecy, inadequate infrastructure and information systems, and unsafe nursing and burial practices. Emergences of arenaviruses causing Argentine and Bolivian hemorrhagic fever are associated with agricultural practices, and Bolivian hemorrhagic fever was spread across Bolivia by road building that fostered migration of reservoir rodents. In Southeast Asia, Nipah virus emerged from bats because of the intensification of pig farming in a bat-rich biodiversity hot spot. Human monkeypox emerged in the United States because of a booming international wildlife trade. In the 1980s, Aedes albopictus mosquitoes were being spread globally by humans; in 2014 and 2015, we had pandemics of aedes-borne chikungunya and Zika viruses.\nMajor epidemics associated with human crowding, movement, and sanitary inadequacy once occurred without spreading globally \u2014 for example, interregional plague pandemics of the 6th, 14th, and later centuries; influenza pandemics beginning in the 9th century; and cholera pandemics in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. When truly global pandemics did become common \u2014 for instance, influenza in 1889, 1918, and 1957 \u2014 they were spread internationally by rail and ship. Then, in 1968, influenza became the first pandemic spread by air travel, and it was soon followed by the emergence of acute enteroviral hemorrhagic conjunctivitis spread between international airports. These events ushered in our modern epidemic era, in which any disease occurring anywhere in the world can appear the next day in our neighbor\u2019s backyard. We have reached this point because of continuing increases in the human population, crowding, human movement, environmental alteration, and ecosystemic complexity related to human activities and creations. Cartoonist Walt Kelly had it right decades ago: \u201cWe have met the enemy, and he is us.\u201d\nPreventing and controlling future pandemic occurrences remains a global priority.4 With Covid-19, are we seeing a replay of 1918? Although we did not \u201cwitness\u201d the beginning of the 1918 pandemic, evidence suggests that wherever it began, it silently spread around the world, causing mostly mild cases but also mortality of 0.5 to 1% or higher \u2014 a rate that was initially too low to be detected against a high background rate of death from unrelated respiratory illnesses. Then it suddenly exploded in urban centers almost everywhere at once, making a dramatic entrance after a long, stealthy approach. We are now recognizing early stages of Covid-19 emergence in the form of growing and geographically expanding case totals, and there are alarming similarities between the two respiratory disease emergences. Like pandemic influenza in 1918, Covid-19 is associated with respiratory spread, an undetermined percentage of infected people with presymptomatic or asymptomatic cases transmitting infection to others, and a high fatality rate.5\nWe are taking swift public health actions to prevent an emergence from becoming a pandemic, including isolation of patients and contacts to prevent secondary spread. But will these actions be adequate? Most experts agree that such measures could not have prevented the 1918 influenza pandemic. In fact, in the past century we have never been able to completely prevent influenza spread at the community level, even with vaccination and antiviral drugs. The problem is that most influenza cases are either asymptomatic, subsymptomatic, undiagnosed, or transmitted before the onset of symptoms. Can we do better with SARS-CoV-2, a virus with a presumably longer incubation period and serial generation time, but with an as-yet-undetermined ratio of inapparent cases to apparent cases and an unknown rate of asymptomatic spread? The answer to this question is critical, because without the ability to prevent such spread, we will cross a threshold where pandemic prevention becomes impossible. And we won\u2019t know that we have arrived there until it is too late.\nWith luck, public health control measures may be able to put the demons back in the jar. If they do not, we face a daunting challenge equal to or perhaps greater than that posed by the influenza pandemic of a century ago. As the late Nobel laureate Joshua Lederberg famously lamented about emerging infectious diseases, \u201cIt\u2019s our wits versus their genes.\u201d Right now, their genes are outwitting us by adapting to infectivity in humans and to sometimes silent spread, without \u2014 so far \u2014 revealing all their secrets. But we are catching up. As we push ahead, we should take heart in the Hesiod version of the Pandora myth, in which Pandora managed to prevent a single escape: \u201cOnly Hope was left \u2026, she remained under the lip of the jar, and did not fly away.\u201d\nDisclosure forms provided by the authors are available at NEJM.org.\nThis article was published on February 26, 2020, at NEJM.org.\nAuthor Affiliations\nFrom the Office of the Director (D.M.M.) and the Viral Pathogenesis and Evolution Section, Laboratory of Infectious Diseases (J.K.T.), National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Bethesda, MD; and EcoHealth Alliance, New York, New York (P.D.).\nSupplementary Material\nDisclosure Forms PDF 184KB\nReferences (5)\nCiting Articles (10)", "10.1056/NEJMp2004768": "3 References\n2 Citing Articles\nLast year, after a month of dry cough and shortness of breath while walking up the steep steps of Fillmore Street in San Francisco, Mary, my mother-in-law and housemate, noticed that she was becoming more and more easily winded. When her symptoms didn\u2019t improve over the next several weeks, her doctors at the University of California, San Francisco, ordered a CT scan. They found bronchiolitis obliterans, a chronic, progressive lung condition that leads to gradually worsening lung disease and respiratory collapse. There is no treatment for this disease, whose natural history ends in lung transplantation for patients who are young and healthy enough to undergo it. Mary has spent every day of the past year and a half focused on respiratory physiotherapy, practicing breathing techniques that ease her symptoms but do little to slow disease progression.\n\u201cWhat can Mama do to stay safe?\u201d my wife asks, in light of the coronavirus cases now cropping up in San Francisco. There are many things we don\u2019t yet know about Covid-19. We do know, however, that like many viral illnesses, it is most deadly to people who are elderly, already ill, or immunocompromised. And it is especially dangerous to those with lung conditions, given the predominance of pulmonary complications. I recommend the guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, telling my wife, \u201cShe can stay home, cover her coughs, and practice good hand hygiene.\u201d1\nSign up for the Weekly Table of Contents email.\nEach week, receive an email with links to the articles published in the current week's issue of the New England Journal of Medicine. SIGN UP\nMary and I discuss the situation in the kitchen of the multigenerational home we\u2019ve shared since I moved to San Francisco as a new doctor a few years ago. In a city with housing costs that skyrocketed with the tech boom, young professionals like me have had to rethink our definitions of personal space. In our home, we have balanced everyone\u2019s needs well, managing odd hours, grocery shopping, and cooking out of sync with each other\u2019s schedules. My friends ask Mary, a history professor at San Jose State University, for reading recommendations to help them compare the current rise of nationalism with that of the early 20th century, and in turn she asks us for Ruth Bader Ginsburg memes to show her class. We watch Netflix together, on mail-order DVDs, after long days.\nWe take long walks in the neighborhood, through the San Francisco streets Mary has called home since childhood, and her childhood friends join us along the way. She treats each step as part of her physiotherapy. It seems to make this convalescent period that much more bearable for her, to be able to reexperience her transitions from girlhood to womanhood, from motherhood to grandmotherhood, while maintaining some form of normalcy. Though the stairs up to the poetry section at City Lights have gotten harder to climb, at least Ginsberg and Kerouac are still there when she arrives.\nBut now that coronavirus has crept into San Francisco like Karl the Fog, visiting a bookstore can feel like a risk. Is it worth it? Mary wonders before stepping out the door. What if someone at Cal-Mart has it? Has my student who was coughing in the back row been traveling? \u201cI\u2019ll need to cancel my trip to Berlin,\u201d she says, imagining the recirculated airplane air and the crowds moving through travel hubs and responding to evolving travel restrictions. Travel \u2014 especially to that once-war-torn city with its famous wall meant as a form of barrier protection from the infectious spread of capitalism \u2014 is one of Mary\u2019s passions.\nShe is undeterred, however, since she has some control over these risks, and she vows to keep living her life and being involved in her community, if even remotely, until she\u2019s told she can\u2019t. The only restriction she is sure that she\u2019ll avoid, at all costs, is visiting the hospital, where viruses jump around waiting rooms and hide in white coats and Half Windsors. \u201cWe\u2019ve always said the real point of entry for coronavirus is a busy emergency room,\u201d noted Mike Ryan of the World Health Organization\u2019s Health Emergencies Program. All Mary has to do is avoid the places where sick people go.\nThere\u2019s only one problem: every day when I return home from work, I\u2019m coming back from a busy emergency department (ED).\nThe irony is that despite health workers\u2019 being \u201cthe glue that holds the health system and outbreak response together,\u201d per Tedros Ghebreyesus, director-general of the WHO, 41% of the Covid-19 cases in Wuhan resulted from hospital-related transmission.2 Health care providers are at increased risk for developing the condition and spreading it.3 Work stress is believed to weaken their immune systems, and close, intimate care of patients can lead to exposure to a higher viral load. Despite performing selfless work on behalf of their communities, health care workers have faced social stigma during this outbreak.\nAs a colleague and I go through the 17 steps for donning personal protective equipment and the subsequent 11 steps for safely doffing it in the back corner of the ED, Coldplay\u2019s \u201cClocks\u201d comes through on my overnight playlist: Am I a part of the cure, or am I part of the disease? We wonder whether our commitment to our community puts our families at risk at home. But who would manage the triage tents, resuscitate the respiratory failures, and manage the intensive care units if health care professionals steered clear? Who would study the disease spread, investigate novel therapies, develop the disaster plans, or manage all the other health issues that continue to occur without regard for the virus? If some physicians or nurses or physician assistants stop coming to work, the health care system will face further stress, and patient outcomes will suffer.\nNevertheless, I see the horror in my wife\u2019s face whenever I scratch my nose with the end of my glasses or sneeze into my elbow. It\u2019s as though she\u2019s hearing the police tell her that \u201cThe call is coming from inside the house!\u201d The virus\u2019s threat is as ominous as a gun\u2019s \u2014 both far more dangerous to you when they live in your home than when wielded by an invader. Yet the wounds these pathogens inflict and the diseases they spread are what my colleagues and I have devoted our lives to treating. Are we being irresponsible to our families and friends by going out to dinner, by hugging or kissing them good night?\nMary and I talked about what it would mean if she were to become infected. Breathing might be as difficult as marching up Mount Everest without an oxygen tank. She might cough so much that her chest would feel like she had just ducked out of the ring with Muhammad Ali. She might need to be hospitalized. Her lung reserve is so low that she would most likely wind up on a mechanical respirator in an intensive care unit, probably on the 13th floor at UCSF, where I trained several years ago. Perhaps the team would attempt extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), hoping that more time would be the answer. It is not unlikely that she would die, that this invisible invader, this microscopic enemy would be the end of her story. All this just because I came home.\nI stand in the ambulance bay outside the hospital at 6 a.m. and begin to call friends from residency. I\u2019m looking for a room where I can stay: last night, I was exposed to a patient with possible Covid-19 who needed intubation. The music still plays in my head: Home, home, where I wanted to go. \u201cI have space at my apartment, and if you\u2019re exposed, I guess I am, too,\u201d Sam, my fellow overnight doc, says as she walks through the sliding doors behind me. Times like this can leave physicians stranded between our commitment to the community and responsibility to our families \u2014 a no man\u2019s land where a colleague\u2019s spare bed may be the closest approximation of home that we can find.\nDisclosure forms provided by the author are available at NEJM.org.\nThis article was published on March 18, 2020, at NEJM.org.\nAuthor Affiliations\nFrom the Center for Health Policy, Freeman Spogli Institute for International Studies, and the Center for Primary Care and Outcomes Research, School of Medicine \u2014 both at Stanford University, Stanford, CA.\nSupplementary Material\nDisclosure Forms PDF 149KB\nReferences (3)\nCiting Articles (2)", "10.1056/NEJMp2007124": "5 References\nMedicaid \u2014 and how to pay for it \u2014 has become a recurring theme in several current critical policy debates. Fourteen U.S. states have not yet expanded the program under the Affordable Care Act (ACA), mostly because of concerns about the potential impacts on state budgets, and these decisions have left more than 2 million low-income adults without any health care coverage.1,2 Meanwhile, earlier this year, the Trump administration invited states to submit proposals to shift Medicaid to a block-grant or per-capita-allotment system with a capped federal contribution. Most recently, the coronavirus epidemic has hit like a thunderbolt, both federal and state policymakers are looking to Medicaid as a central tool in their response to this national emergency.\nFor all these areas, it has become increasingly important to understand how Medicaid is paid for. Medicaid\u2019s basic financing structure since its creation in 1965 has been a joint state and federal effort. The federal government creates the ground rules for state participation in the program in exchange for large subsidies to the states. Before the ACA, states received a \u201cmatch rate\u201d (formally the federal medical assistance percentage, or FMAP), which varies by states\u2019 per capita income. Higher-income states such as New York and California have a 50% match rate, while Mississippi \u2014 the poorest state in the country \u2014 currently has an FMAP of nearly 78%. The states are responsible for the remainder of Medicaid program costs, which they finance through sources including general state revenues and taxes on health care providers. The ACA sweetened the deal for states considerably in its Medicaid expansion, covering newly eligible adults with 100% federal funding from 2014 through 2016, and then scaling back to 95% in 2017, 94% in 2018, 93% in 2019, and 90% thereafter.2\nSign up for the Weekly Table of Contents email.\nEach week, receive an email with links to the articles published in the current week's issue of the New England Journal of Medicine. SIGN UP\nSo how has this system worked since the creation of the ACA Medicaid expansion, and what does the Covid-19 pandemic mean in terms of the best way to structure the program?\nChanges in State Spending Associated with Medicaid Expansion, Using Federal Funds as Compared with State Funds, 2010\u20132018.\nIn recent research, we analyzed budget data from all 50 states from 2010 through 2018 to assess the impact of the ACA Medicaid expansion. As expected, we found that expansion states experienced a substantial increase in Medicaid spending since implementation of the expansion, with 24% higher growth than nonexpansion states between 2013 and 2018. Critically, when analyzing the source of funds, we found that this increase in Medicaid spending was subsidized entirely by increased federal funding to expansion states, with no significant changes in spending from state revenues associated with Medicaid expansion (see graphs).3 We also found no evidence that Medicaid expansion forced states to cut back on spending on other priorities, such as education, transportation, or public assistance, despite frequent assertions by opponents of expansion that the policy would inevitably have such harmful effects.\nHow could states have expanded Medicaid without increasing state spending, when they were on the hook for 5% of the expansion costs in 2017 and 6% in 2018? Our findings in this regard are consistent with case studies from several states showing that they have used federal dollars from the Medicaid expansion to offset other areas of state spending, such as direct subsidies to public hospitals and mental health centers, health care costs for people involved with the justice system, and a more generous match rate for optional groups previously covered by many state Medicaid programs.4 Thus, Medicaid expansion appears to be a win\u2013win from the states\u2019 perspective \u2014 giving health insurance to millions of low-income adults and offering financial support to safety-net hospitals, without any adverse effects on state budgets.\nYet proposals for dramatic changes to the way Medicaid is paid for are in the works, with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) recently launching the \u201cHealthy Adult Opportunity\u201d initiative that encourages states to leave behind this system and shift to a fixed federal contribution. The basic economics of the Medicaid match-rate system clarify the potential advantages and drawbacks of such an overhaul. The large subsidy from the federal government leads states to cover far more people under Medicaid than if they were spending only their own funds. Such broadened coverage was the intent of Congress in the 1960s and with the passage of the ACA in 2010. Critics, however, contend that the subsidy leads states to be inefficient in running their programs, producing high costs with what some have called \u201cmediocre\u201d outcomes \u2014 despite a large body of evidence showing wide-ranging health benefits of Medicaid expansion.5 Viewing the program as overly expensive and ineffective, the administration has pushed states to accept caps on federal support for Medicaid in exchange for flexibility to refashion the program in terms of who is eligible, what services are covered, and how care is delivered.\nThe current Covid-19 crisis highlights a major flaw in this proposal when it comes to unexpected public health shocks. The open-ended nature of the match-rate subsidy means that states experiencing sudden increases in Medicaid costs continue to receive additional federal support to cover a large portion of those expenses \u2014 which is critical, since most states (unlike the federal government) are legally prohibited from going into a budget deficit.\nHistorically, there have been three main drivers of unexpected cost growth in Medicaid: economic downturns, when many people lose coverage through work and more people need government assistance; natural or public health disasters, such as Hurricane Katrina in 2005, when Medicaid funding was critical to helping Louisiana cope with the disaster, and more recently, the opioid epidemic; and expensive new technologies relevant to the Medicaid population, such as the invention of new antiviral medications for hepatitis C over the past decade.\nUnfortunately, all three factors are poised to hit states in 2020. First, the Covid-19 pandemic threatens to overwhelm health care providers and hospitals, especially resource-poor safety-net providers that are heavily reliant on Medicaid in the first place. These providers often care for some of the sickest patients and those who are at highest risk for coronavirus infection, particularly those with disabilities and people living in nursing homes. Second, with sweeping public health measures, state-mandated business closures, and a stock-market crash, a recession is highly likely over the coming months. Third, if and when effective treatments and a vaccine are available for Covid-19, Medicaid will be called on to pay for these new services for tens of millions of beneficiaries.\nIn the current context, it is hard to imagine a worse policy approach in Medicaid than to cap federal contributions to the program and shift to predetermined block-grant allotments for states. There is simply no way for Congress or CMS, in setting an annual cap for Medicaid, to anticipate or predict the course of this sort of rapidly unfolding disaster, in which Medicaid must be relied on to play a critical role. In recognition of this fact, the first federal Covid-related economic relief package passed in March leaned heavily on the existing Medicaid system, increasing the match rate by 6.2 percentage points until September 2021. This increase is a good start, though a larger boost for a longer period may ultimately be needed.\nGiven these realities \u2014 and the fact that existing Medicaid expansions have not produced the dire effects on state budgets that critics predicted \u2014 there is no moment in recent memory more critical than now to bolster Medicaid. Covering more people in Medicaid is a rapid way to bring needed resources into the health care system and infuse federal dollars into state economies on the verge of a major downturn. Medicaid expansion also requires no new infrastructure or federal oversight to achieve, unlike many other types of stimulus spending. Medicaid remains highly popular with voters from both parties.2 And most important, expanding Medicaid can save lives.5\nCongress has stepped up with additional support for the program to expand its reach, and now states should do the same. In light of the program\u2019s role in managing the coronavirus epidemic, maximizing long-term health, and helping to stabilize the health care system in a time of crisis, the case for Medicaid expansion in the remaining 14 states has never been stronger.\nDisclosure forms provided by the authors are available at NEJM.org.\nThis article was published on March 31, 2020, at NEJM.org.\nAuthor Affiliations\nFrom the Department of Economics, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge (J.G.); and the Department of Health Policy and Management, Harvard T.H.

Her husband \u2014 a 56-year-old whose father died of sudden cardiac arrest at 55 \u2014 had been feeling chest pressure. The pressure radiated down his arms and occasionally to his neck and, the previous day, had been accompanied by dyspnea and diaphoresis, making him worried enough to call an ambulance. The emergency medical technicians did an electrocardiogram, said it looked OK, and told him to call his primary care doctor. He did, and he was advised that given New York\u2019s Covid-19 outbreak, it was not a good time to go to the hospital. Now, a day later, his colleague asked Lasic, what should they do?\nNearly apoplectic, Lasic advised urgent coronary angiography, which he performed a few hours later. The man had a thrombus extending from his proximal-to-midleft anterior descending artery and became hemodynamically unstable during the procedure. Nevertheless, revascularization was successful, and he was discharged the following day with preserved left ventricular function. Lasic, describing a precipitous decline across the New York region in patients presenting with acute coronary syndromes, worries that others won\u2019t be so lucky. \u201cI think the toll on non-Covid patients will be much greater than Covid deaths,\u201d he said.\nAs the coronavirus pandemic focuses medical attention on treating affected patients and protecting others from infection, how do we best care for people with non\u2013Covid-related disease? For some, new risks may warrant reconsideration of usual standards of care. For others, the need to protect caregivers and preserve critical care capacity may factor into decisions. And for everyone, radical transformation of the health care system will affect our ability to maintain high-quality care. As Michael Grossbard, chief of hematology at New York University\u2019s Langone Hospital, told me, \u201cOur practice of medicine has changed more in 1 week than in my previous 28 years combined.\u201d\nCancer care, which often involves immunosuppressive therapy, tumor resection, and inpatient treatment, has been disproportionately affected by Covid-19. Like other oncologists I spoke with, Grossbard, who primarily treats lymphoma, has been tasked with revising chemotherapy protocols to minimize both the frequency of chemotherapy visits and the degree of immunosuppression. For example, though patients with low-grade lymphoma typically receive maintenance therapy, it will not be recommended for now because it requires an office visit, worsens immunosuppression, and improves progression-free but not overall survival. Other protocol modifications have arisen because of cancellations of elective surgeries. For instance, some patients with solid tumors, such as breast and rectal cancers, are being offered systemic therapy before, rather than after, surgery.\nMany modifications may not affect long-term outcomes. Eric Winer, a breast oncologist at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, believes, for instance, that giving antihormonal therapy to women with hormone-receptor\u2013positive breast tumors and delaying surgery probably won\u2019t alter overall survival, though this approach hasn\u2019t been formally tested in Stage I disease. But even when there\u2019s greater uncertainty about treatment modifications, Winer has been impressed by many patients\u2019 graceful acceptance.\nI spoke to Ms. C., a 40-year-old patient of Winer who was recently diagnosed with inflammatory breast cancer. Treatment typically involves 4 to 6 months of chemotherapy followed by surgical excision, though as Ms. C. said, \u201cWhen you have cancer, your first reaction is \u2018Just get it out of my body now.\u2019\u201d But as she and Winer watched Covid-19 decimate Italy, they began discussing what the evolving situation would mean for her. She\u2019d started receiving an anthracycline, which heightened her risk of infection, and was supposed to have surgery in May. When we spoke, it wasn\u2019t clear whether or when her surgery would proceed, but she and Winer had agreed that if it was postponed, she would resume targeted systemic therapy. She seemed to take this uncertainty in stride, partly because the hallmark rash of inflammatory breast cancer disappeared after she began receiving Herceptin (trastuzumab) a few months ago. \u201cI literally saw my cancer shrink,\u201d she told me, \u201cand I\u2019m so thankful we are where we are now, as opposed to 25 years ago.\u201d\nSuspending other aspects of cancer care will have graver consequences. David Ryan, chief of oncology at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH), told me that three patient groups worry him most. The first are the subgroup of patients with lymphoma for whom CAR-T therapy is potentially curative. More than half these patients receive therapy in clinical trials, many of which have been paused amid society-wide shutdowns; even if enrollment could continue, there\u2019s concern about the need for ICU care in a resource-constrained system. A related concern is for patients requiring bone marrow transplants, given their high risk of infection and potential need for ICU care.\nFinally, and most wrenching to Ryan, are patients with refractory tumors who are nearing the end of life, but for whom an experimental targeted therapy may hold promise; Ryan would otherwise offer these patients enrollment in an early-phase trial. One recent analysis suggests that such enrollment is associated with clinical benefit in nearly 20% of patients,1 and participation allows patients to have some hope in their dying days and to feel like they\u2019re \u201cgiving back\u201d to the scientific community.\nThe individual toll, as clinical trials slow to a crawl, is mirrored by a societal one. As Ryan, who sent me an email message while serving a volunteer shift in the hospital\u2019s Covid unit, lamented, \u201cThere\u2019s no question that clinical research in cancer will be set back by at least a year as we all drop what we\u2019re doing to take care of the surge of patients.\u201d\nProtecting Our Patients, Preserving Ourselves\nAnother distressing trade-off is that between patients\u2019 needs for procedures and the need to protect caregivers from infection and preserve hospital capacity. A cardiologist friend, for example, told me about a woman in her 70s with some cardiac risk factors who developed chest pressure and shortness of breath. She was reluctant to go to the hospital, and when she presented (at a highly regarded institution), she needed urgent intubation. When chest radiography revealed bilateral interstitial edema, she became a \u201cCovid rule-out\u201d and was transferred to the ICU. As her team awaited the Covid test results, her troponin level climbed, causing increasing concern about an acute coronary syndrome. Though this suspicion would usually prompt more urgent coronary angiography, the uncertainty about Covid status delayed the procedure. When the Covid result came back negative, she underwent urgent coronary angiography, which revealed an acute coronary occlusion. By then, however, she had developed progressive cardiogenic shock, and she ultimately died.\nThough physicians must often make judgments amid uncertainty, we typically focus on the patient\u2019s risk, not our own. In an infectious disease epidemic, our calculus must incorporate our own exposure risk \u2014 and how exposure would limit our ability to care for future patients. The agony and complexity of these decisions is currently compounded by shortages of personal protective equipment (PPE). Ajay Kirtane, an interventional cardiologist at Columbia who has coauthored recommendations for cardiac catheterization laboratories during the pandemic,2 told me that \u201cPeople are being told to do procedures with inadequate protection.\u201d Though these recommendations aim to minimize both staff exposure and resource utilization, Kirtane recognizes the potential consequences of caution. \u201cOne of the yet-to-be-told stories of the Covid-19 pandemic is the recognition that the (necessary) proscriptions on the performance of less urgent cases has led to collateral damage to so many patients with medical conditions that truly couldn\u2019t wait.\u201d\nAlthough canceling procedures such as elective hernia repairs and knee replacements is relatively straightforward, for many interventions the line between urgent and nonurgent can be drawn only in retrospect. As Brian Kolski, director of the structural heart disease program at St. Joseph Hospital in Orange County, California, told me, \u201cA lot of procedures deemed \u2018elective\u2019 are not necessarily elective.\u201d Two patients in his practice whose transthoracic aortic valvular replacements were postponed, for example, died while waiting. \u201cThese patients can\u2019t wait 2 months,\u201d Kolski said. \u201cSome of them can\u2019t wait 2 weeks.\u201d Rather than a broad moratorium on elective procedures, Kolski believes we need a more granular approach. \u201cWhat has been the actual toll on some of these patients?\u201d he asked.\nMr. R., a 75-year-old man with advanced heart failure, is another of Kolski\u2019s patients for whom the toll has been great. Because he had progressive volume overload and delirium, Kolski referred him to a hospital for an LVAD workup in early March. Then, as his wife, Ms. R., told me, \u201cthe world went wonky, and everything went down the toilet.\u201d Having begun admitting patients with coronavirus, the hospital told the couple it was kicking everyone else out. \u201cThey are telling me my husband has 6 to 12 months to live without this procedure,\u201d Ms. R. said, \u201cand now they are canceling it on us.\u201d They were then quarantined at home \u2014 2 hours away from the hospital \u2014 with no plan in place. Mr. R.\u2019s health quickly deteriorated again, but his wife had been advised to keep him out of the hospital. When they finally had a video visit on April 9, he\u2019d become so ill that the heart failure physician didn\u2019t recognize him. Mr. R. was promptly admitted, and the LVAD was placed. Though Ms. R. is relieved, ongoing challenges include her husband\u2019s persistent delirium, a visitor policy that allows her to be at the bedside only intermittently, and the need for nearby lodging that they can\u2019t afford.\nAs painful as these stories are, the degree of uncertainty renders calculated risk\u2013benefit analyses impossible. Should hospitals schedule LVAD placements when ICU and ventilator capacity may soon be exceeded? Is a patient with severe aortic stenosis more likely to die from his underlying valvular disease or from a valve-replacement hospitalization that leaves him with coronavirus infection? How many times can you expose a cath-lab team to patients with Covid-19\u2013associated myocarditis, which can mimic an acute coronary syndrome, before so many staff members are infected that no one remains to treat patients with real myocardial infarction? No one knows the answers to these questions because modern medicine has never faced them before.\nIndeed, as Robert Yeh, an interventional cardiologist and health services researcher at Boston\u2019s Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, emphasized, \u201cthere perhaps has never been a greater gap between what we need to know urgently and what is actually knowable.\u201d From policy questions, such as how long to postpone elective procedures, to treatment decisions, such as whether to treat Covid-19 with investigational therapies, the stakes of \u201cfailing to understand the universe we don\u2019t pursue\u201d have increased. Referring to the global reduction in patients presenting with acute coronary syndromes, Yeh worries that our emphasis on social mitigation measures makes people who truly need care afraid to seek it. Equally worrisome is how we treat people with myocardial infarction who do reach the hospital. Concern about proceduralists\u2019 exposure has led some physicians to advocate using thrombolytics rather than the standard revascularization strategy, but Yeh asks, \u201cAre we protecting ourselves at the cost of worse patient outcomes?\u201d\nYeh and his colleagues plan to attempt to answer some of these questions empirically, but as we await epidemiologic data, he cautioned against dismissing anecdotes emerging from around the world in the name of scientific purity. Right now, he emphasized, \u201cthe sum total of what we hear from our colleagues at other institutions is the best data we have.\u201d\nTrade-offs We Don\u2019t Have to Make\nMs. D. is a 51-year-old ICU nurse who was recently diagnosed with breast cancer and underwent lumpectomy in late February; unfortunately, the margins were not clear. When she then learned in early March that she carried the BRCA2 mutation, she discussed with her surgeon either further excision and intense monitoring or bilateral mastectomy. Ms. D chose the latter but wanted some time to process the decision. With \u201cCovid barreling in,\u201d however, she was urged not to delay. Pathology studies then revealed cancer in the contralateral breast. Though Ms. D. was relieved to have the procedure over with, the rush was hard. \u201cI wished I had time to say goodbye to my breasts,\u201d she recalled.\nHarder still was follow-up. Ms. D. was discharged with bilateral axillary drains, which she removed herself, as was \u201cstrongly recommended.\u201d But the most difficult moment was the postsurgical multidisciplinary meeting, which would typically be a discussion of treatment options with the team who\u2019d be caring for her, followed by an opportunity to learn about social and emotional support resources. For Ms. D., this meeting instead happened more quickly over the phone, without the visual cues we rely on to signal that we may be overwhelmed or confused. She knows she received lifesaving care. Indeed, sidelined by her illness while watching her nurse colleagues risk their lives on the front lines, she jokes that cancer saved her life. But the lack of face-to-face interaction, compounded by the unavailability of typical support systems, has made it difficult to cope. \u201cCancer is so emotionally loaded,\u201d she told me, \u201cYou need some love. The human part is falling by the wayside.\u201d\nHumanity absent sound medical judgment is meaningless. But though the pandemic may force difficult choices, my sense from both doctors and patients is that making these decisions thoughtfully and transparently helps patients feel cared for. Under some circumstances, simply hewing to medicine\u2019s foundational principles will suffice. For example, when I asked Brian Bergmark, a colleague and interventional cardiologist at Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital, about whether our cath lab would use thrombolytics in lieu of the usual revascularization strategy for acute coronary syndromes, he said his group would maintain the standard of care as long as possible: \u201cWe still have the capacity to provide the right therapy for the right disease for the right patient.\u201d\nBut what should we do when capacity limitations necessitate delays? Hugh Auchincloss, a thoracic surgeon at MGH, who, like many surgeons, has had to delay some cases, notes that patients may \u201cthink that a bunch of administrators and bureaucrats are issuing blanket proclamations about their care.\u201d Auchincloss emphasizes how important it is for patients to know that he has personally reviewed their cases and postponed only those he has deemed nonurgent. Having spoken to all his patients facing delays, he said that despite the difficulty of these conversations, patients are reassured knowing that their doctor has made a personal judgment.\nThese caring gestures probably assume greater importance in pandemic circumstances. The common fear of \u201cbothering the doctor\u201d is magnified amid images of doctors risking their lives on the front lines. Even Ms. C., the woman with inflammatory breast cancer, felt guilty asking Winer, her oncologist, how Covid might affect her care. \u201cI felt very selfish bringing it up,\u201d she told me. \u201cThe whole world is going through this crisis, and here I am thinking about my own situation. But I am also facing life and death.\u201d Yet despite not knowing whether her mastectomy will proceed, Ms. C. feels as cared for as ever. She trusts Winer. He articulated a clear rationale for alternative therapies, and he and his nurse practitioner leave her feeling as if, for her, they have all the time in the world.\nPerhaps the greatest challenge, then, is an invisible one: How do we help people who are afraid to seek care to begin with? To date, much public health messaging regarding Covid has focused on social distancing, hand hygiene, PPE for health care workers, and the need for increased testing. Yet as we begin to observe fewer admissions for common emergencies such as heart attack and stroke,3,4 the need for vigilance about viral transmission need not detract from an equally important message: Covid or no Covid, we are still here to care for you.\nDisclosure forms provided by the author are available at NEJM.org.\nThis article was published on April 17, 2020, at NEJM.org.\nAuthor Affiliations\nDr. Rosenbaum is a national correspondent for the Journal.\nSupplementary Material\nDisclosure Forms PDF 150KB\nReferences (4)", "10.1056/NEJMe2007263": "2 Citing Articles\nThe President says we are at war with the coronavirus.

Most analyses of options and trade-offs assume that both the pandemic and the economic setback must play out over a period of many months for the pandemic and even longer for economic recovery. However, as the economists would say, there is a dominant option, one that simultaneously limits fatalities and gets the economy cranking again in a sustainable way.\nSign up for the Weekly Table of Contents email.\nEach week, receive an email with links to the articles published in the current week's issue of the New England Journal of Medicine. SIGN UP\nThat choice begins with a forceful, focused campaign to eradicate Covid-19 in the United States. The aim is not to flatten the curve; the goal is to crush the curve. China did this in Wuhan. We can do it across this country in 10 weeks.\nAnd with enough intelligence about the enemy \u2014 where the virus lurks, how quickly it is moving, where it is most threatening, and what its vulnerabilities are \u2014 we can begin to re-energize the economy without putting additional lives at risk.\nIf we take these six steps to mobilize and organize the nation, we can defeat Covid-19 by early June.\n1. Establish unified command. The President should surprise his critics and appoint a commander who reports directly to the President. This person must have the President\u2019s full confidence and must earn the confidence of the American people. This is not a coordinator across agencies. This commander carries the full power and authority of the American President to mobilize every civilian and military asset needed to win the war. Ask every governor to appoint an individual state commander with similar statewide authority. The diversity of our nation and the various stages of the epidemic in different regions allow us to target responses to specific places and times, deploy and redeploy limited national supplies where they can do the most good, and learn from experience as we go.\n2. Make millions of diagnostic tests available. Not everyone needs to be tested, but everyone with symptoms does. The nation needs to gear up to perform millions of diagnostic tests in the next 2 weeks. This was key to success in South Korea. Every decision about managing cases depends on sound medical evaluation and the results of diagnostic tests. Without diagnostic tests, we cannot trace the scope of the outbreak. Use creative ways to mobilize the nation\u2019s research laboratories to assist with population screening; refer persons who screen positive for further evaluation. Organize dedicated clinical test sites in every community that are physically apart from other care centers, such as the drive-through test centers that have begun to spring up.\n3. Supply health workers with PPE and equip hospitals to care for a surge in severely ill patients. Ample supplies of PPE (personal protective equipment) should be standard issue to every U.S. health worker who is in the front lines caring for patients and testing for infection. We wouldn\u2019t send soldiers into battle without ballistic vests; health workers on the front lines of this war deserve no less. Regional distribution centers should rapidly deploy ventilators and other needed equipment from the national stockpile to hospitals with the greatest need. Despite everyone\u2019s best efforts, in areas hardest hit, crisis standards of care will need to be put into effect to make ethically sound, unavoidable decisions about the use of available equipment and supplies.\n4. Differentiate the population into five groups and treat accordingly. We first need to know who is infected; second, who is presumed to be infected (i.e., persons with signs and symptoms consistent with infection who initially test negative); third, who has been exposed; fourth, who is not known to have been exposed or infected; and fifth, who has recovered from infection and is adequately immune. We should act on the basis of symptoms, examinations, tests (currently, polymerase-chain-reaction assays to detect viral RNA), and exposures to identify those who belong in each of the first four groups. Hospitalize those with severe disease or at high risk. Establish infirmaries by utilizing empty convention centers, for example, to care for those with mild or moderate disease and at low risk; an isolation infirmary for all patients will decrease transmission to family members. Convert now-empty hotels into quarantine centers to house those who have been exposed, and separate them from the general population for 2 weeks; this kind of quarantine will remain practical until and unless the epidemic has exploded in a particular city or region. Being able to identify the fifth group \u2014 those who were previously infected, have recovered, and are adequately immune \u2014 requires development, validation, and deployment of antibody-based tests. This would be a game-changer in restarting parts of the economy more quickly and safely.\n5. Inspire and mobilize the public. In this all-out effort, everyone has a part to play and virtually everyone is willing. We have begun to unleash American ingenuity in creating new treatments and a vaccine, providing a greater variety and number of diagnostic tests, and using the power of information technology, social media, artificial intelligence, and high-speed computing to devise novel solutions. These efforts should be intensified. Everyone can help reduce the risk of exposure and support their friends and neighbors in this critical time. After all health workers have the masks they need, the U.S. Postal Service and willing private companies can join to deliver surgical masks and hand sanitizer to every American household. If everyone wears a surgical mask outside the home, those who are presymptomatic and infected will be less likely to spread the infection to others. And if everyone wears a mask, no stigma is attached.\n6. Learn while doing through real-time, fundamental research. Clinical care would be vastly improved by effective antiviral treatment, and every plausible avenue should be investigated. We did it with HIV; now, we need to do it faster with SARS-CoV-2. Clinicians need better predictors of which patient\u2019s condition is prone to deteriorate rapidly or who may go on to die. Decisions to shape the public health response and to restart the economy should be guided by science. If we learn how many people have been infected and whether they are now immune, we may determine it\u2019s safe for them to return to their jobs and resume more normal activities. Is it safe for others to return to work? That depends on the level of infection still ongoing, on the nature of possible exposures in the workplace, and on reliable screening and rapid detection of new cases. Can schools safely reopen? That depends on what we learn about children as transmitters of the virus to their teachers, parents, and grandparents. How dangerous are contaminated spaces and surfaces? That depends on the survival of virus under different environmental conditions and on various materials.\nIf we take this concerted and determined approach and are guided by science, we can begin to revive businesses of all kinds, including airlines, hotels, restaurants, and entertainment venues. By putting cash in peoples\u2019 pockets over the next couple of months, protecting small businesses, and releasing constraints on credit, the President, Congress, and the Federal Reserve will have positioned the economy to come roaring back \u2014 once the virus is out of the picture.\nIf we do this, we can relieve Americans of avoidable grief and loss, play our part in the global struggle against Covid-19, and be in a stronger position to help other countries. If we persist with half-measures against the coronavirus, we risk saddling the economy with a long-term and avoidable burden of anxious consumers, illness, higher medical costs, and constricted business activity.\nWhile we strive to overcome the immediate epidemic, we should take steps to be better equipped to deal with the coronavirus over time and with other emerging threats in the 21st century. A safe and effective vaccine will help protect everyone and serve as a bulwark against reintroduction of the virus from other parts of the world. Reinvigorating the public health infrastructure will strengthen national, state, and local capacities to respond to future threats. Devising accurate predictive models for emerging infections will vastly improve preparedness.\nRather than stumble through a series of starts and stops and half-measures on both the health and the economic fronts, we should forge a strategy to defeat the coronavirus and open the way to economic revival. If we act immediately, we can make the anniversary of D-Day on June 6, 2020, the day America declares victory over the coronavirus.\nDisclosure forms provided by the author are available with the full text of this editorial at NEJM.org.\nThe views expressed are those of the author and do not necessarily represent the views of any organization with which he is affiliated.\nThis editorial was published on April 1, 2020, at NEJM.org.\nAuthor Affiliations\nFrom the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation, Palo Alto, CA, and the National Academies Standing Committee on Emerging Infectious Diseases and 21st Century Health Threats, Washington, DC.\nSupplementary Material\nDisclosure Forms PDF 144KB\nCiting Articles (2)", "10.1056/NEJMp2003149": "5 References\nBefore the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic, each day seemed to bring another headline about the crisis of physician burnout. The issue had been simmering for years and was brought to a boil by mounting changes in the health care system, most prominently the widespread implementation of the electronic health record (EHR) and performance metrics.1 Initially, the prevailing attitude was that burnout is a physician problem and that those who can\u2019t adapt to the new environment need to get with the program or leave. Some dismissed the problem as a generation of \u201cdinosaur\u201d doctors whining and pining for an inefficient, low-tech past. But recently, it has become clear that millennials, residents, and even medical students are showing signs of burnout. The unintended consequences of radical alterations in the health care system that were supposed to make physicians more efficient and productive, and thus more satisfied, have made them profoundly alienated and disillusioned. The problem has become even more urgent with the realization that it\u2019s costing the health care system approximately $4.6 billion a year.2\nSolutions have largely targeted the doctor, proposing exercise classes and relaxation techniques, snacks and social hours for decompressing, greater access to child care, hobbies to enrich free time, and ways to increase efficiency and maximize productivity. There is scant evidence that any of these measures have had a meaningful impact, as shown by a recent meta-analysis of 19 controlled studies evaluating a total of more than 1500 physicians.3 These data lead to the inescapable conclusion that currently proposed solutions do not address the underlying problem: a profound lack of alignment between caregivers\u2019 values and the reconfigured health care system. A largely neglected field of organizational psychology provides an explanation and a roadmap for ameliorating physician burnout.\nSign up for the Weekly Table of Contents email.\nEach week, receive an email with links to the articles published in the current week's issue of the New England Journal of Medicine. SIGN UP\nSeminal work by Gagn\u00e9 and Deci examined motivation in the workplace.4 The researchers classified motivation as intrinsic or extrinsic: people may perform an activity because they find it interesting and derive spontaneous satisfaction from the activity itself (intrinsic motivation); or they may receive a tangible external reward, so that satisfaction comes not from the activity itself but from that reward (extrinsic motivation). One might imagine that intrinsic and extrinsic motivators would have additive or even synergistic effects. But Gagn\u00e9 and Deci showed that tangible extrinsic motivators, such as monetary rewards, can paradoxically undermine intrinsic motivation. Such unexpected effects occur particularly among professionals who undertake complex tasks requiring cognitive flexibility, creativity, and problem solving.\nMedicine is in many ways unique. Doctors, nurses, and other health care professionals have traditionally viewed their work as a calling. They tend to enter their field with a high level of altruism coupled with a strong interest in human biology, focused on caring for the ill. These traits and goals lead to considerable intrinsic motivation. In a misguided attempt to improve the medical system, health care reformers put into place various positive and negative extrinsic motivators, without realizing that they would actually erode and destroy intrinsic motivation, eventually leading to \u201camotivation\u201d \u2014 in other words, burnout.\nReformers are perplexed that monetary incentives haven\u2019t worked to prevent or remedy burnout. Using a monetary reward as a central motivation strategy seems practical and appealing. However, in a recent survey of more than 15,000 doctors in 29 specialties (Medscape National Physician Burnout and Suicide Report 2020), half the doctors said they would give up at least $20,000 in annual income in order to reduce their work hours; these doctors included millennials, who are among the lowest earners. It\u2019s important to emphasize that money in and of itself is not toxic; Gagn\u00e9 and Deci observed that an increase in yearly salary or a bonus does not diminish intrinsic motivation. But bringing money to the fore in each individual patient interaction \u2014 by translating physicians\u2019 work into relative value units, for example \u2014 does.\nGagn\u00e9 and Deci posit that there are three pillars that support professionals\u2019 intrinsic motivation and psychological well-being: autonomy, competence, and relatedness.3 All three have been stripped away as a direct result of the restructuring of the health care system.1\nAutonomy, according to Gagn\u00e9 and Deci, means having the right to act with a sense of volition and having the experience of choice. Physicians now endure a profound lack of control over their time and even language. The amount of time we spend with a patient, what is discussed (even to the point of uniform scripts), and how a visit is documented are all frequently mandated. We are further controlled by surveillance in the form of time and motion studies and timing of our use of the EHR.\nCompetence was once viewed as having a deep fund of medical knowledge and exercising clinical judgment appropriately with each patient. Under recent health care reforms, it has been redefined as compliance with various metrics, many of which are not evidence-based. Competence has also become a matter of checking off boxes in the EHR and satisfying insurers\u2019 demands by quickly placing a note in the record for billing purposes, even if it\u2019s incomplete or erroneous. In defense, many doctors now add a disclaimer that the note has not been proofread and to \u201cdisregard any errors.\u201d\nRelatedness is the psychological feeling that one belongs, has interpersonal attachments, and is connected to the social organization. Doctors want to give patients the time and support they need, and they want the system to value and recognize their efforts to provide this kind of care. While much lip service is given to \u201cpatient-centered care,\u201d many doctors feel that the system is increasingly driven by money and metrics, with rewards for professionals who embrace these priorities.\nMedicine\u2019s daily tasks have become Sisyphean. Physicians recognize that it\u2019s impossible to satisfy the current system\u2019s demands. If you surrender, the joy of engaging with your patients is diminished and ultimately lost. If you resist, you incur the system\u2019s wrath. Doctors are finally expressing the pain they feel. Emily Silverman, a hospitalist at the University of California, San Francisco, recently bemoaned in the New York Times \u201cthe relentless reminders of tasks we haven\u2019t completed, supplications to correct our documentation for billers, and daily, jaundiced reminders: You are currently deficient.\u201d\nBurnout is toxic for patients as well as physicians, because it\u2019s associated with loss of empathy, impaired job performance, and increases in medical mistakes.5 Family and friendships also suffer as the EHR\u2019s demands invade doctors\u2019 homes and consume the time once enjoyed in vital relationships, worsening emotional exhaustion.\nThe problem of burnout will not be solved without addressing the issues of autonomy, competence, and relatedness. Evidence from the meta-analysis of controlled interventions supports the restoration of autonomy; giving doctors flexibility in their schedule to allow for individual styles of practice and patient interaction was one of the few system solutions that reduced burnout.3 Flexibility in scheduling recognizes that both patients and doctors are individuals, and some interactions simply take longer than others. The EHR, initially lauded for its potential as a repository of patient information, has become a tyrannical, time-consuming billing tool; it must be reconfigured to work for physicians rather than forcing physicians to work for it.\nCompetency can be restored by purging the system of meaningless metrics while maintaining a core of evidence-based measures, allowing for clinical judgment, and honoring individual patient preferences. Relatedness should be authentic, aligning the system\u2019s values with those of physicians, nurses, and other health care professionals who chose their careers out of altruism. Restoring these three pillars will support the return of intrinsic motivation.\nWith the Covid-19 pandemic, medicine is at a crisis point. Health care professionals are responding with an astounding display of selflessness, caring for patients despite the risk of profound personal harm. Our efforts are recognized and applauded. During this interlude filled with uncertainty, there has been a sense of altruism and urgency that has unexpectedly catalyzed the restoration of some elements of autonomy, competency, and relatedness. Indeed, the whole medical system, including hospital administrators and insurers, among others, has rallied to support the caregivers. But will these positive changes be sustained? Tectonic shifts are at work as hospitals and clinics suffer grave financial losses and the workforce is diminished by illness and exhaustion. As the current crisis ultimately abates, we need to remember the lesson that the system can be reset. It is time to evaluate what has worked and what hasn\u2019t in health care reform. We must not return to the former status quo.\nDisclosure forms provided by the authors are available at NEJM.org.\nThis article was published on May 1, 2020, at NEJM.org.\nAuthor Affiliations\nFrom Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and Harvard Medical School \u2014 both in Boston.\nSupplementary Material\nDisclosure Forms PDF 187KB\nReferences (5)", "10.1056/NEJMp2005755": "4 References\n5 Citing Articles\nFor many weeks, the British instinct to \u201cKeep Calm and Carry On\u201d was the public face of the U.K. government\u2019s response to Covid-19. Policies were to be \u201cbased on the science,\u201d with an initial focus on containment, involving identification of people infected with SARS-Cov-2, contact tracing, and isolation of people with proven exposure. As late as the second week of March, there was no appetite for banning mass gatherings, since we were told, on the basis of statistical modeling, that doing so would have minimal impact. On Thursday, March 12, when Prime Minister Boris Johnson held his first major press conference on the issue, flanked by his chief medical advisor and his chief science advisor, there was no recommendation, far less any instruction, to shut down one of the busier weekends on the sporting calendar. Such inaction continued despite the prime minister\u2019s warning that \u201cmany more families will lose loved ones before their time.\u201d\nMore than 250,000 people gathered at the annual horse-racing carnival in Cheltenham, England. Tens of thousands of Scottish fans were about to travel to Wales, by car, bus, and train through England, for the Scotland\u2013Wales rugby match. Many more tens of thousands were set to travel up and down the country to attend soccer matches. In the absence of a government policy, the football authorities (both rugby and soccer) acted with admirable responsibility: they postponed the matches despite the financial losses they suffered. The racing proceeded \u2014 perhaps the racing industry is more prepared to gamble.\nSign up for the Weekly Table of Contents email.\nEach week, receive an email with links to the articles published in the current week's issue of the New England Journal of Medicine. SIGN UP\nOtherwise, it was largely business as usual over the weekend, although some shops were stripped of toilet paper. Many members of the U.K. public health community had been sending messages of increasing concern, some as far back as the initial publication of data from China in January, more as the epidemic gathered steam in the United Kingdom and Europe in February, and many more as the plight of our Italian colleagues and their patients became apparent. The lack of government action in the second week of March was also completely out of step with almost all other European countries.\nThe U.K. chief science advisor\u2019s statement, repeated in interviews, that the way out of this epidemic was to get to 60% or more of the population recovered from infection and thus approach \u201cherd immunity\u201d did not provide reassurance. An infectious disease modeler at Harvard, originally from the United Kingdom, initially assumed that this proposal was meant as satire.1 Much of the public immediately understood that the trade-off appeared to be to accept a large number of deaths soon, to ultimately get the population to a Covid-19\u2013resistant state. The minister of health was obliged to deny on the Sunday talk shows that this strategy was the government policy. At the same time, he asked any U.K. company that could switch to the manufacture of ventilators to do so; the government would guarantee to buy as many as could be produced.\nThe other argument for \u201cKeep Calm and Carry On\u201d was that behavioral scientists were warning that \u201cfatigue\u201d with strict infection-control measures would set in if they were triggered too soon. The newspapers have sourced this advice to a government \u201cnudge unit.\u201d2 Nobody appears to have asked this \u201cbehavioral insights team\u201d whether they were working from empirical experience of a highly contagious infectious disease that may be lethal for several percent of older people and will most likely kill people we know, as well as prominent public figures. The fear of such fatigue combined with legitimate concerns about the adverse effects of social distancing on some older people\u2019s sense of isolation, loneliness, and health care access led to an argument that social distancing should be delayed as long as possible.\nOn Monday, March 16, late in the day, at another press conference and again flanked by the chief medical advisor and chief science advisor, the prime minister abruptly changed gears, though whether from neutral to first, second, or a higher gear is a matter of opinion. Anyone with a fever or a persistent cough should self-isolate for 7 days. Good advice. Anyone who lives with these persons should self-isolate for 14 days. Also good advice. People \u201cshould avoid pubs, clubs, theaters, and other such social venues\u201d as well as nonessential travel, but this advice was not enforced. A mixed message. People should work from home if possible, but that was largely up to employers to decide. Vague. Anyone over 70 was advised to avoid \u201cnonessential social contact.\u201d Vague again. The government was \u201cmoving emphatically away from\u201d mass gatherings, but again these were still not (and are still not) banned. British understatement was in full swing \u2014 citizens, businesses, and nursing homes were asked to read between the lines and go beyond explicit government policy. The prime minister\u2019s father announced that he would be going to the pub if he chose to, since they needed the customers.\nLater on Monday, what is apparently the scientific underpinning of the change in government policy was finally published online: a model from a very experienced group at Imperial College, London.3 Under any response scenario, the number of cases that require ICU admission greatly exceeds the surge capacity of the National Health Service (NHS). However, the model also predicts that closing schools and universities would help dampen the epidemic peak\u2026and yet the schools were left open (although many private schools chose to close). Finally, on Wednesday it was announced that the schools would close beginning at the end of the week, except for vulnerable children and the children of NHS workers and essential personnel.\nPerhaps the government has also finally understood the low point to which the NHS has sunk after a decade of budget cuts dictated by austerity policies. We have universal access to care free at the point of service, and loyal and hard-working health care professionals, yet general practitioners (GPs) are in very short supply, and many hospitals are old and underequipped. Brexit has contributed to the loss of European medical and nursing staff. Thanks to government \u201creforms\u201d of the NHS, it has become highly decentralized, with over 200 commissioning groups in England that can make independent decisions about staffing and procurement of equipment \u2014 far from the monolithic \u201csocialist\u201d health care system it is often assumed to be. The devolved governments in Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland have substantial health system autonomy. At a time when central management of staff and resources might be most helpful, the decentralized decision-making structure leads to competition for resources and inconsistent policies.\nOverall, the United Kingdom has the third-lowest number of hospital beds per 1000 population among the Group of 20 countries.4 Medical staff throughout the country are reporting a severe shortage of personal protective equipment, which obliges them to triage patients with potential Covid-19 while wearing paper face masks and plastic aprons, rather than visors, gowns, and appropriate masks. As medical staff acquire a new fever or cough, they are advised to self-isolate without a SARS-Cov-2 test, further reducing available clinical staff.\nEfforts are being made to ramp up testing for health workers, specialists are being retrained to work in other clinical areas, final-year medical students whose summative clinical exams have been canceled will be graduated and provisionally licensed to practice, GPs are moving visits online and to video links. Guidelines are being written to clarify legal responsibility for triage decisions. A whole health system is being restructured in a matter of days and weeks.\nThroughout the past few weeks, the U.K. mantra has been \u201cwe will act at the appropriate time according to the science.\u201d Many clinicians and scientists have been pushing the panic button, but the alarm, if heard, was not acted on publicly until the third week of March. Everyone is hoping that their gut instincts, the experience of other countries, and now the models are wrong. What is not in doubt is that barring a miracle, a treatment, and ultimately a vaccine, the NHS in the United Kingdom is about to experience a challenge unlike any other in its 70 years of existence.\nDisclosure forms provided by the author are available at NEJM.org.\nThis article was published on March 20, 2020, at NEJM.org.\nAuthor Affiliations\nFrom the Nuffield Department of Population Health, University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom.\nSupplementary Material\nDisclosure Forms PDF 140KB\nReferences (4)\nCiting Articles (5)", "10.1056/NEJMsb1905390": "13 References\n1 Citing Article\nConducting trials of novel interventions during infectious disease emergencies, such as the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic, is increasingly recognized as important for determining the efficacy of potential vaccines and therapies. Clinical trials to evaluate investigational interventions are being implemented as part of the broader efforts to control the spread of an infectious disease and to improve patient outcomes. In such circumstances, however, it can be challenging to acquire the necessary evidence about the effects of the interventions to inform future patient care and public health planning, in part because of the unpredictable size, geographic location, and duration of outbreaks.1\nTo Publish or Not to Publish\nConcern about publication bias has led to an emphasis on the need to report the results of all clinical trials, even those that end early with inconclusive results at the end of an outbreak. This principle is included in statements regarding the ethical framework of clinical trials, such as the Declaration of Helsinki. Following this principle, investigators in trials that were conducted during the 2014\u20132016 West African Ebola epidemic that were terminated early (without reaching predefined stopping criteria) because of waning transmission submitted the inconclusive results for publication as planned at the end of the trial.2-4 Avoidance of publication bias is essential for the development of good policy; nonetheless, publication of inconclusive results (e.g., from an underpowered study) can make it much more difficult to develop definitive evidence about the efficacy and safety of the intervention under investigation.5,6\nAt the end of an outbreak, the release of promising but inconclusive results from partially completed trials may support the belief that confirmatory trials comparing the investigational agents with the previously accepted placebo or standard-of-care comparator could no longer be conducted. This assumption can create a state of perpetual uncertainty about the true effect of both the previously tested agent (which may now be considered the standard of care) and any new agents that are being evaluated. This situation has occurred, for example, with the routine off-label use of ribavirin for the treatment of Lassa fever7 and of oseltamivir for the treatment of severe influenza.\nIn the randomized, controlled PREVAIL (Partnership for Research on Ebola Virus in Liberia) II trial of the triple monoclonal antibody cocktail ZMapp, the investigators concluded that \u201calthough the estimated effect of ZMapp appeared to be beneficial, the result did not meet the prespecified statistical threshold for efficacy.\u201d The evidence of efficacy clearly did not meet the conventional standards for licensure.4 Nevertheless, in 2018, during a large Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), investigators used ZMapp rather than the standard-of-care treatment as the control against which to compare other Ebola therapeutics in the randomized PALM trial (Investigational Therapeutics for the Treatment of People with Ebola Virus Disease).8\nThere is an obvious need to balance the importance of publishing the results of all completed clinical trials against the potential adverse consequences if the published results do not provide reliable answers to the questions that the trials were designed to address. Thus, a new approach to clinical trials is needed to enable reliable evaluations of vaccines and treatments for outbreak pathogens.\nIntroducing the Core Protocol\nAs members of the R&D Blueprint,9 a work plan for designing clinical trials during public health emergencies, sponsored by the World Health Organization (WHO), we advocate the use of a \u201ccore protocol\u201d in such cases. Core protocols (also called master protocols) have been described for simultaneous evaluation of multiple interventions or of a single intervention targeting multiple diseases.10 We propose a core-protocol concept that allows a clinical trial to extend across multiple infectious disease outbreaks. This approach accommodates the changing and unpredictable features of an epidemic and incorporates new investigative team members into the trial over time.\nTo avoid a premature release of data, core protocols would specify that efficacy data from a trial that has not yet been completed because of insufficient enrollment should not be released. After an outbreak has ended at a given site, the trial would be paused. If so specified in the core protocol, an independent monitoring committee could review results from an interim analysis of trial data to make recommendations regarding whether the trial should continue or stop for efficacy, futility, or safety, as guided by a prespecified monitoring plan.11 Under the core protocol, the investigators would remain unaware of any results of the analyses; the trial data would be released only if the trial was stopped on the basis of a recommendation from the monitoring committee or had reached its targeted number of end-point events or amount of participant follow-up.\nVaccine trials that are conducted for 2 years or more are commonly performed to combat diseases with predictable seasonality, such as Lyme disease12 and Argentine hemorrhagic fever,13 with results withheld until the requisite numbers of events have been observed. Such studies provide some precedent, albeit imperfect, for our proposal, which differs in that it focuses on diseases with outbreaks that are less predictable, may not be observed every year, and may reemerge in a different location. Such diseases include those targeted by the R&D Blueprint \u2014 including Ebola virus infection, Middle East respiratory syndrome, Lassa fever, and Nipah virus infection \u2014 that occur irregularly but nonetheless relatively frequently. For pathogens that may emerge only once a decade or even less frequently, this approach may not be practical.\nThe use of core protocols can facilitate the implementation of clinical research across successive outbreaks. The PALM trial included a core-protocol framework to guard against the release of inconclusive data. If the outbreak in the DRC had waned before the conclusion of the trial, the trial would have continued without a release of the results, unless the data monitoring committee had recommended termination. Ultimately, the PALM trial was terminated during the DRC outbreak on the advice of the data monitoring committee when an interim analysis revealed that REGN-EB3 (another cocktail of three monoclonal antibodies) was superior to ZMapp; improved survival was also associated with the monoclonal antibody mAb114 but not with the nucleotide analogue prodrug remdesivir.\nAlthough the PALM trial was successful in identifying two promising therapeutics, there were limitations resulting from the use of ZMapp as the comparator group because its clinical benefit had not been definitively established during the PREVAIL II trial. The overall evidence in support of REGN-EB3 and especially mAb114 would have been stronger if the drugs had been evaluated against a standard-of-care group, as in the PREVAIL II trial, or a drug with known efficacy. Furthermore, the question remains whether ZMapp and remdesivir have any effect. Such findings would have been particularly valuable in settings in which the monoclonal antibody drugs were not available and would have had implications for the development of combination regimens. Finally, it is not clear how data from the PALM trial would have been interpreted if survival had been similar in patients receiving the other drugs and in those receiving ZMapp. These challenges could have been largely avoided if the PREVAIL II trial had been designed under a core protocol. It is likely that the results of the PREVAIL II trial would not have been published at the end of the epidemic, since they did not meet the prespecified level of evidence required, and the trial would have been restarted in the DRC with a standard-of-care group in place plus ZMapp and additional investigational treatments. With accrued data from the DRC, the question of whether ZMapp was effective could have been answered, thus establishing a clearer benchmark for all candidate products. Such a framework could also have eliminated the need for a new protocol altogether.\nEmphasis on Cooperation and Coordination\nThe development of a core protocol involves a preliminary step of engaging researchers and national representatives from affected countries in determining the primary research questions and main design elements. Since officials in the Ministry of Health and other governmental offices in affected countries will be under great political pressure to release the interim results of trials, their approval of the strategy is necessary. Ethics committees and regulatory agencies should be engaged in the earliest stages of protocol planning. There must be a clear and transparent a priori mechanism for achieving consensus regarding elements of the protocol, such as the selection of investigational and control agents and the governance structures to oversee trial operations, manage data and samples, and mediate disagreements among the stakeholders. An international organization, such as the WHO, may be best suited for the responsibility of coordinating stakeholders and maintaining capacity for research over a time period of uncertain duration.\nFor each successive outbreak, study teams should be encouraged to collaborate on existing, ongoing protocols rather than starting new, independent trials. New investigational agents may be added to the protocol over time as they become available or may be removed as deemed appropriate, using a platform trial approach, as described previously.10 Special consideration should be given to allowing flexibility in the study sample size, since some assumptions, such as the case fatality rate in therapeutics trials, may need to be revised over time. In the context of public health emergencies in which there are substantial obstacles to developing reliable and meaningful evidence, we underscore the need for cooperation and coordination among research stakeholders, including funding agencies.9 These types of large-scale, multipartner projects are logistically complex, but there is precedent for them in other areas of clinical research, such as in cancer clinical trials.10 Given the effect of the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic, this message is especially timely. Core protocols are rapidly being developed by the WHO for trials assessing the efficacy of therapies and vaccines that are being developed to combat this infection. Implementing clinical trials for treatments during disease outbreaks under a core protocol could increase the chances of efficiently generating reliable evidence to determine which therapies are effective, thus providing timely information to public health officials and clinicians caring for patients.\nDisclosure forms provided by the authors are available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org.\nWe thank the other members of the R&D Blueprint for their thoughtful feedback.\nAuthor Affiliations\nFrom the Department of Biostatistics, University of Florida, Gainesville (N.E.D., I.M.L.); the World Health Organization, Geneva (P.-S.G., A.M.H.-R.); the Department of Biostatistics, University of California, Los Angeles (R.B.); the Department of Biostatistics, Yale University, New Haven, CT (F.W.C.); the Department of Statistics (C.A.D.) and the Centre for Tropical Medicine and Global Health (P.H.), University of Oxford, Oxford, the Medical Research Council (MRC) Centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis, Department of Infectious Disease Epidemiology, Imperial College London (C.A.D.), and the MRC Tropical Epidemiology Group, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (P.G.S.), London, and the Department of Mathematics and Statistics, Lancaster University, Lancaster (T.J.) \u2014 all in the United Kingdom; the Department of Biostatistics, Epidemiology, and Informatics, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia (S.S.E.); the Department of Biostatistics, University of Washington (T.R.F., M.E.H.), and the Vaccine and Infectious Disease Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center (M.E.H.) \u2014 both in Seattle; the Office of Vaccines Research and Review, Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, Food and Drug Administration, Silver Spring (P.R.K.), and the Biostatistics Research Branch, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Bethesda (M.C.N.) \u2014 both in Maryland; Institut National de Recherche Biom\u00e9dicale, Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of Congo (S.M., J.-J.M.-T.); and the Department of Population Medicine, Harvard Medical School and Harvard Pilgrim Health Care Institute (R.W.), and the Department of Biostatistics, Harvard T.H.

The person who helps you dress writes your name and your role on your lab coat with a red marker, because when we are so costumed nobody recognizes anybody else.

For the first 10 to 15 minutes you can\u2019t see anything because your breath fogs up the visor until it adapts to the temperature, and then you start seeing something between the droplets of condensation. You walk in, hoping the shoe covers will not come off as usual, and the shift starts.\nYou take your instructions from your exhausted colleagues from the previous shift. There is a phone that\u2019s used for receiving special instructions on hospitalizations from the regional coordinator of the health system; you hope it will not ring often and that hospitalizations will be few. You and your colleagues sort out tasks and you start visiting patients: the young patient you were about to intubate the other day is getting better, the elderly one is dying, the nun is still fighting, and the nurse from your hospital is not doing well\u2026. You see faces you don\u2019t know and others you know very well, the faces of people who worked in your ward until only a couple of weeks ago.\nIt\u2019s amazing how quickly everything has changed. Your research and clinic routine feel so far away. You miss the emergency department shifts because compared with this, they appear easy as pie. The hours go by, and your nose hurts more and more, the mask cuts through your skin and you can\u2019t wait to take it off and finally breathe. Breathe. It\u2019s what we all want these days, doctors and patients, nurses and care workers. All of us. We want air.\nFinally, the end of your shift comes, 8 hours made even longer and more endless by thirst, hunger, and the need to relieve yourself, things you cannot do when you\u2019re on duty: drinking, eating, or going to the bathroom would mean taking off the protective equipment. Too risky. And too expensive. Protective equipment is precious, and taking it off means having to replace some of it, reducing the quantity available to your colleagues. You have to be thrifty, you have to resist and wear a diaper you hope you won\u2019t have to use because your dignity and your psychological state are compromised enough as it is by the work you are doing, the look on the patients\u2019 faces, the words of their relatives when you call them to update them on the condition of their loved ones.

You give them instructions, the things to do, the things not to do. You can go home, but first you have to take off your protections, and you must be careful \u2014 careful with every move you make. Removing protective equipment is another ritual that must be performed calmly, because everything you are wearing is contaminated and must not come in contact with your skin.\nYou are tired and you just want to get away, but you must make one last effort, concentrate on each movement you make to remove all the protections. Each movement has to be slow. You can finally take off the mask, and when you peel it off, you feel a searing pain from the bleeding cuts that it made in your nose. The tape was useless \u2014 it didn\u2019t stop your nose from bleeding or hurting. But at least you\u2019re free.

Although rationing is not unprecedented, never before has the American public been faced with the prospect of having to ration medical goods and services on this scale.\nOf all the medical care that will have to be rationed, the most problematic will be mechanical ventilation. Several countries, but not the United States, have already experienced a shortage of ventilators. Acute care hospitals in the United States currently have about 62,000 full-function ventilators and about 98,000 basic ventilators, with an additional 8900 in the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response Strategic National Stockpile.1 The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that 2.4 million to 21 million Americans will require hospitalization during the pandemic, and the experience in Italy has been that about 10 to 25% of hospitalized patients will require ventilation, in some cases for several weeks.2 On the basis of these estimates, the number of patients needing ventilation could range between 1.4 and 31 patients per ventilator. Whether it will be necessary to ration ventilators will depend on the pace of the pandemic and how many patients need ventilation at the same time, but many analysts warn that the risk is high.3\nSign up for the Weekly Table of Contents email.\nEach week, receive an email with links to the articles published in the current week's issue of the New England Journal of Medicine. SIGN UP\nAlthough shortages of other goods and services may lead to deaths, in most cases it will be the combined effects of a variety of shortages that will result in worse outcomes. Mechanical ventilation is different. When patients\u2019 breathing deteriorates to the point that they need a ventilator, there is typically only a limited window during which they can be saved. And when the machine is withdrawn from patients who are fully ventilator-dependent, they will usually die within minutes. Unlike decisions regarding other forms of life-sustaining treatment, the decision about initiating or terminating mechanical ventilation is often truly a life-or-death choice.\nMany states have developed strategies for rationing during pandemics. The New York Guidelines target saving the most lives, as defined by the patient\u2019s short-term likelihood of surviving the acute medical episode.4 Rationing is performed by a triage officer or a triage committee composed of people who have no clinical responsibilities for the care of the patient. Triage proceeds in three steps: application of exclusion criteria, such as irreversible shock; assessment of mortality risk using the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score, to determine priority for initiating ventilation; and repeat assessments over time, such that patients whose condition is not improving are removed from the ventilator to make it available for another patient.\nAnticipating the need to allocate ventilators to the patients who are most likely to benefit, clinicians should proactively engage in discussions with patients and families regarding do-not-intubate orders for high-risk subgroups of patients before their health deteriorates. Once patients have already been placed on mechanical ventilation, decisions to withdraw it are especially fraught. Less than 50 years ago, physicians argued that withdrawing a ventilator was an act of killing, prohibited by both law and ethics. Today, withdrawal of ventilatory support is the most common proximate cause of death in ICU patients, and withdrawal of this support at the request of a patient or surrogate is considered an ethical and legal obligation. Withdrawal of a ventilator against the wishes of the patient or surrogate, however, is primarily done only in states and hospitals that permit physicians to unilaterally withdraw life support when treatment is determined to be futile.\nDecisions to withdraw ventilators during a pandemic in order to make the resource available to another patient cannot be justified in either of these ways: it is not being done at the request of the patient or surrogate, nor can it be claimed that the treatment is futile. Even though the chances of survival may be low, in the absence of the pandemic the treatment would be continued. Whereas this type of rationing may not be unusual in countries that tragically have a chronic shortage of essential ICU care, it is unprecedented for most physicians who practice in well-resourced countries. Reports from Italy describe physicians \u201cweeping in the hospital hallways because of the choices they were going to have to make.\u201d5\nThe angst that clinicians may experience when asked to withdraw ventilators for reasons not related to the welfare of their patients should not be underestimated \u2014 it may lead to debilitating and disabling distress for some clinicians. One strategy for avoiding this tragic outcome is to use a triage committee to buffer clinicians from this potential harm. We believe that such a committee should be composed of volunteers who are respected clinicians and leaders among their peers and the medical community.\nAdvantages of this approach are that it allows the physicians and nurses caring for the patients to maintain their traditional roles as fiduciary advocates, including the opportunity to appeal the initial decision of the committee when appropriate. While working together to ensure consistent and unbiased decisions across patient groups, the committee also has the flexibility to consider factors that may be unique to a given situation. As circumstances change and the availability of ventilators increases or decreases, the committee can adjust its rationing criteria to produce the best outcomes. Finally, when a hospital is placed in the unavoidable but tragic role of making decisions that may harm some patients, the use of a committee removes the weight of these choices from any one individual, spreading the burden among all members of the committee, whose broader responsibility is to save the most lives.\nIn addition to removing the responsibility for triage decisions from the bedside clinicians, committee members should also take on the task of communicating the decision to the family. The treating clinicians may be motivated to try to comfort the family by telling them that mechanical ventilation is not being provided because it would be futile and by reassuring them that everything possible has been done. Though well intentioned, such inaccurate representations could ultimately undermine public trust and confidence. Having the committee members communicate these decisions would ensure that the message is clear and accurate, helping to prevent confusion or misunderstandings.\nSimilarly, the physicians, nurses, or respiratory therapists who are caring for the patient should not be required to carry out the process of withdrawing mechanical ventilation; they should be supported by a team that is willing to serve in this role and that has skills and expertise in palliative care and emotional support of patients and families. Pain and suffering at the end of life can be controlled, and these patients deserve the best that palliative care can provide.\nIn the weeks ahead, physicians in the United States may be asked to make decisions that they have never before had to face, and for which many of them will not be prepared. Though some people may denounce triage committees as \u201cdeath panels,\u201d in fact they would be just the opposite \u2014 their goal would be to save the most lives possible in a time of unprecedented crisis. Creation and use of triage committees, informed by experience in the current pandemic2 and prior written recommendations,4 can help mitigate the enormous emotional, spiritual, and existential burden to which caregivers may be exposed.\nDisclosure forms provided by the authors are available at NEJM.org.\nThis article was published on March 23, 2020, and updated on March 24, 2020, at NEJM.org.\nAuthor Affiliations\nFrom the Center for Bioethics (R.D.T., C.M.), the Department of Global Health and Social Medicine (R.D.T., C.M.), the Office of the Dean of the Faculty of Medicine (G.Q.D.), Harvard Medical School, and the Department of Anesthesiology, Critical Care, and Pain Medicine, Boston Children\u2019s Hospital (R.D.T.) \u2014 both in Boston.\nSupplementary Material\nDisclosure Forms PDF 124KB\nReferences (5)\nCiting Articles (14)", "10.1056/NEJMp2012114": "I stand in the parking lot of our emergency department and watch three men on horseback trot up the shoulder of the highway. They wear bandanas over their faces, a traditional accessory here in northwest New Mexico, where spring is wind-and-dust season.

SIGN UP\nThe Navajo Nation, Din\u00e9 Bik\u00e9yah, is 27,000 square miles of high-altitude desert, steep canyons, red rock spires, and extinct volcanoes, which, at this time of year, are still spotted with snow. The population density is among the lowest in the contiguous United States: seven people per square mile. If you didn\u2019t know better, the vast landscape would seem a perfect setup for social distancing.\nBut where cell-phone service is spotty and broadband nonexistent, human networks are strong and extensive. On the Covid ward, I ask a patient about her family contacts. She uses her breakfast tray to explain. The applesauce container is the home she shares with her kids, the milk carton is where her sister\u2019s family stays nearby, and the cup is her mother\u2019s hogan, the traditional Navajo dwelling. Other family members stay there part-time. There are many people under each roof, even if this tight cluster of roofs is 20 miles of dirt road away from anyone else.\nThe national media reports on the severity of the Navajo Nation outbreak and hits the usual notes of poverty, isolation, and lack of running water. These reports are factually accurate: the virus penetrated towns that utility companies have never managed to reach. But I yearn for stories that mention the diversity of talent and experience here, the resourcefulness. Outsiders seem surprised that the rural landscape hasn\u2019t protected us. I don\u2019t think the Navajo are surprised. From smallpox to H1N1 influenza, infections from the outside have always found their way here. It\u2019s just infrastructure that hasn\u2019t. It\u2019s not news.\nThe president of the Navajo Nation has issued a curfew. A graffiti artist covered the burned-out hardware store where I used to buy irrigation supplies with a striking mural of a woman in traditional Navajo dress wearing an N95 mask. \u201cStay strong, stay safe everyone,\u201d it exhorts. Memes on social media depict the 6 feet of social distancing as two sheep-lengths or as five sacks of Bluebird flour, the local favorite. Here, as everywhere, the recommendations sometimes clash with necessity. There is no public transit besides hitchhiking. Distances are long, and gas money is short; families travel together.\nThe Fever Clinic continues in the parking lot. It is meant for SARS-CoV-2 testing, but we end up treating ear infections and even giving the occasional Depo-Provera shot through a car window. Our Incident Command organizes a home-testing team so families don\u2019t have to travel to us. Along with the tests, the team brings boxes of donated supplies: bleach, paper towels, canned goods. So many people work behind the scenes to make this happen \u2014 anything to reduce the likelihood that someone will have to leave home or come inside the hospital.\nIn our small hospital, the leadership and Incident Command are not faceless administrators. The people making the Covid policies are the same people donning PPE and taking care of patients. They order hand sanitizer for the hospital and two liters of oxygen for their patients. They are exhausted. Our bureaucracy has never been nimble. It still takes far too many signatures to purchase a pallet of nitrile gloves, but we are masters of the work-around, the get-it-done approach. It\u2019s the only way to handle an epidemic in which everything changes by the hour.\nThis practicality is inspired by our community. Like our patients, we manage each day with the resources we have. Many of our staff \u2014 secretaries, doctors, therapists, nurses \u2014 are locals. Some balance their day jobs with ranching, farming, and making art. On my first day in the Fever Clinic, my colleagues show me how to doff my gown into the correct garbage bin, and in between patients they discuss how to call a coyote (there\u2019s a device) and how to get a stubborn bull away from your house (a bucket of food). Many people know how to fix cars, cut hair, and buy a month\u2019s worth of shelf-stable groceries on a budget. So it\u2019s no surprise that my boss, the best doctor I know, offers to draw blood if we\u2019re short-staffed. She\u2019s reorganized our entire outpatient clinic and is setting up emergency housing, but apparently she also used to be a phlebotomist.\nOur public health nurses make daily phone calls to people diagnosed with Covid who are still at home. Are they short of breath? Do they have food? The nurses listen carefully to how easily each person can speak. Meanwhile, our clinician epidemiologists, with dozens of other responsibilities, review our data. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention refers to Persons Under Investigation for infection but we shift our mindset to Families Under Investigation. Cases increase rapidly, still clustering in families. Usually, in an outbreak, contact tracing makes way for community mitigation when spread becomes extensive. Here, it is hard to find a line between family and community spread.\nA few family networks have been particularly devastated. The virus landed in the middle of the reservation and exploded outward, from a remote region with an emergency department but no hospital. Many patients were transferred 100 miles east to our facility, but others were sent equally far in the opposite direction. Some were transported south to Albuquerque or Phoenix. Over the ensuing weeks, these families have had sick and dead members spread along an 800-mile circuit. Family members who are healthy enough are trying to coordinate hospital discharges, home oxygen delivery, transport of bodies, and memorials, all while grieving the loss of multiple relatives, young and old. The impact of this collective trauma is hard to grasp.\nThe virus takes advantage of the expansive Navajo definitions of \u201cauntie\u201d and \u201ccousin-brother.\u201d I have always loved this generosity. My elder patients ask me about their grandbabies, meaning my own school-aged sons. I refer to them as grandma and grandpa, shim\u00e1 and cheii. Elders are revered as keepers of knowledge and tradition, which makes this virus especially ominous. Now, between shifts, I call my shim\u00e1s on the phone. Over a terrible cell connection, I explain to one patient that a cancer has metastasized. With another, I review the results from her Holter monitor, futilely illustrating her heart arrhythmia on a notepad she can\u2019t see. I worry about them. As we say goodbye, they tell me that they are worried about me. \u201cBe careful\u201d they say. \u201cWe\u2019re praying for you.\u201d I am surprised to hear my voice crack as I reply.\nI don\u2019t know what will come next. A month ago, our first cases alarmed us; a week ago, our hospital was at surge level three: a series of tarps separated our Covid ward from the rest of the hospital. Now we are at level five: the whole hospital is essentially the Covid ward. At level six, we may expand to a school gymnasium. By the time you read this, everything will look different, but it won\u2019t be over. The news cameras will have gone, but we will still be here. The men on horses, if they don\u2019t get sick, will be trotting up the highway each morning. They will still be wearing masks.\nDisclosure forms provided by the author are available at NEJM.org.\nThe views expressed in this article are those of the author and do not necessarily represent those of the Indian Health Service.\nThis article was published on April 24, 2020, at NEJM.org.\nAuthor Affiliations\nFrom the Northern Navajo Medical Center, Shiprock, NM.\nSupplementary Material\nDisclosure Forms PDF 66KB", "10.1056/NEJMp2005630": "5 References\n8 Citing Articles\nThe need to rapidly develop a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 comes at a time of explosion in basic scientific understanding, including in areas such as genomics and structural biology, that is supporting a new era in vaccine development. Over the past decade, the scientific community and the vaccine industry have been asked to respond urgently to epidemics of H1N1 influenza, Ebola, Zika, and now SARS-CoV-2. An H1N1 influenza vaccine was developed relatively rapidly, largely because influenza-vaccine technology was well developed and key regulators had previously decided that vaccines made using egg- and cell-based platforms could be licensed under the rules used for a strain change. Although a monovalent H1N1 vaccine was not available before the pandemic peaked in the Northern Hemisphere, it was available soon afterward as a stand-alone vaccine and was ultimately incorporated into commercially available seasonal influenza vaccines.\nVaccines for the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Ebola, and Zika did not follow a similar path. The SARS and Zika epidemics ended before vaccine development was complete, and federal funding agencies reallocated funds that had been committed to vaccine development, leaving manufacturers with financial losses and setting back other vaccine-development programs.\nSign up for the Weekly Table of Contents email.\nEach week, receive an email with links to the articles published in the current week's issue of the New England Journal of Medicine. SIGN UP\nDevelopment of an Ebola vaccine by the Public Health Agency of Canada had been on hold when the 2013\u20132016 Ebola outbreak began. The U.S. government provided funding to accelerate the vaccine\u2019s development, which was ultimately transferred to Merck. The company continued development even when the outbreak ended, and stockpiles of investigational product were available for use in the recent outbreaks in the Democratic Republic of Congo. The vaccine received conditional marketing authorization from the European Medicines Authority and approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration at the end of 2019 and in several African countries thereafter. Some companies working on Ebola vaccines have received external support and invested their own funds to continue development. Even with successful development and licensure, however, the prospect that commercial markets will sustain multiple vaccines for which relatively few doses may need to be manufactured seems dim.\nReviews of the experience with H1N1 vaccine have stressed the need for novel development-and-manufacturing platforms that can be readily adapted to new pathogens. Vaccine and biotech companies have been investing heavily in such approaches, with support from the U.S. government and other funders. The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases has led an initiative to support early development of platforms and test them against \u201cprototype pathogens\u201d from various viral families.1\nOur organization, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovation (CEPI), an international nongovernmental organization funded by the Wellcome Trust, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, the European Commission, and eight countries (Australia, Belgium, Canada, Ethiopia, Germany, Japan, Norway, and the United Kingdom), is supporting development of vaccines against five epidemic pathogens on the World Health Organization (WHO) priority list. We aim to develop reserves of investigational vaccines for each pathogen after such vaccines have completed phase 2a trials, expecting that they will undergo clinical trials during future outbreaks. CEPI also supports development of platform technologies to prepare for \u201cDisease X\u201d \u2014 a newly emerging epidemic disease, such as Covid-19. An ideal platform would support development from viral sequencing to clinical trials in less than 16 weeks, demonstrate elicitation of consistent immune responses across pathogens, and be suitable for large-scale manufacturing using a pathogen-agnostic platform.\nMultiple platforms are under development. Among those with the greatest potential for speed are DNA- and RNA-based platforms, followed by those for developing recombinant-subunit vaccines. RNA and DNA vaccines can be made quickly because they require no culture or fermentation, instead using synthetic processes. Developers\u2019 and regulators\u2019 experience with these platforms for personal oncology vaccines can facilitate rapid testing and release. There are no approved RNA vaccines to date, but RNA vaccines have entered clinical trials, and regulators have experience in reviewing clinical trial applications and with associated manufacturing of the vaccines.\nVaccine Platforms, Their Attributes, and the Status of Vaccine Candidates.\nUse of next-generation sequencing and reverse genetics may also cut development time of more conventional vaccines during epidemics. The table lists major platform types and examples of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine types being developed on each. A more complete and continually updated list is available from the WHO.2\nEven with novel platforms, SARS-CoV-2 vaccine development poses challenges. First, although the virus\u2019s spike protein is a promising immunogen for protection, optimizing antigen design is critical to ensure optimal immune response. Debate continues over the best approach \u2014 for example, targeting the full-length protein or only the receptor-binding domain.\nSecond, preclinical experience with vaccine candidates for SARS and the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) have raised concerns about exacerbating lung disease, either directly or as a result of antibody-dependent enhancement. Such an adverse effect may be associated with a type 2 helper T-cell (Th2) response. Hence, testing in a suitable animal model and rigorous safety monitoring in clinical trials will be critical. (It is still too early to define good animal models; rhesus macaques appear quite promising, as do hamsters and ferrets [unpublished data].) If adjuvants are required to generate a sufficient immune response or for dose sparing, those triggering a Th1 response and demonstrating a high neutralizing-antibody response are theoretically more likely to be protective and avoid the risk of immunopathology. However, data and careful regulatory review will be needed. (A summary of a recent conference can be found at https://brightoncollaboration.us/brighton-collaboration-cepi-covid-19-web-conference/\n. opens in new tab\n.)\nThird, although correlates of protection may be inferred from experience with SARS and MERS vaccines, they are not yet established. As with naturally acquired infection, the potential duration of immunity is unknown; similarly, whether single-dose vaccines will confer immunity is uncertain.\nDifference between Traditional Vaccine Development and Development Using a Pandemic Paradigm.\nVaccine development is a lengthy, expensive process. Attrition is high, and it typically takes multiple candidates and many years to produce a licensed vaccine.3 Because of the cost and high failure rates, developers typically follow a linear sequence of steps, with multiple pauses for data analysis or manufacturing-process checks. Developing a vaccine quickly requires a new pandemic paradigm (see diagram), with a fast start and many steps executed in parallel before confirming a successful outcome of another step, hence resulting in elevated financial risk. For example, for platforms with experience in humans, phase 1 clinical trials may be able to proceed in parallel with testing in animal models.\nAs soon as China announced that a novel coronavirus had been identified as the cause of the Wuhan outbreak, CEPI contacted its partners that were developing MERS vaccines or working on novel platforms. With the potential for further financial support, they and others began vaccine development as soon as the first gene sequence was posted, and development is proceeding quickly. Moderna\u2019s mRNA-based SARS-CoV-2 candidate entered a phase 1 clinical trial on March 16, less than 10 weeks after the first genetic sequences were released; the first phase 1 trial with a nonreplicating vector-based vaccine has regulatory clearance to start phase 1 studies in China. Other phase 1 trials of nucleic acid vaccines are expected to start in April.\nFor some candidates, additional clinical trial material for phase 2 studies is being manufactured now; proceeding rapidly beyond phase 2 trials means manufacturing will need to be scaled up to commercial levels before substantial safety and immunogenicity data are available. Building manufacturing capacity can cost hundreds of millions of dollars. Furthermore, for novel platform technologies, most of which are unlicensed, large-scale manufacturing has never been done, so facilities capable of producing large quantities of product must be identified, technologies transferred, and manufacturing processes adapted, all without knowing if the vaccine candidate is viable.\nIt\u2019s far from certain that these new platforms will be scalable or that existing capacity can produce sufficient quantities of vaccine fast enough. It\u2019s therefore critical that vaccines also be developed using tried-and-true methods, even if they may take longer to enter clinical trials or to result in large numbers of doses.\nConducting clinical trials during a pandemic poses additional challenges. It\u2019s difficult to predict where and when outbreaks will occur and to prepare trial sites to coincide with vaccine readiness for testing. In addition, if multiple vaccines are ready for testing in the second half of 2020, it will be important not to crowd sites or burden countries and their ethics and regulatory authorities with multiple trials, as happened with Ebola therapeutics during the 2013\u20132016 outbreak.\nMoreover, in a high-mortality situation, populations may not accept randomized, controlled trials with placebo groups; although other approaches that address such concerns may be scientifically feasible, they\u2019re typically not as fast, and the results can be harder to interpret.4 This problem can sometimes be overcome by comparing outcomes with early vaccination versus delayed vaccination, as in the \u201cEbola \u00e7a suffit!\u201d trial. One possible way forward would be to test several vaccines simultaneously in an adaptive trial design using a single, shared control group, so that more participants would receive an active vaccine.5 This approach has advantages but can be logistically and statistically complex, and developers often avoid trials that may generate head-to-head comparative data.\nCEPI, as a relatively new organization, had not established financial mechanisms and instruments to support development of pandemic vaccines and will need to raise additional funds to see SARS-CoV-2 vaccines through the development and scale-up manufacturing processes. Although as many as several million vaccine doses may become available as a by-product of development, in a pandemic situation, once vaccine candidates are proved safe and effective, doses must be manufactured in large quantities. Though some high-income countries may pay for development and manufacture with their own populations in mind, there\u2019s no global entity responsible for financing or ordering vaccine manufacture. Discussions with global stakeholders about organizing and financing large-scale vaccine manufacturing, procurement, and delivery are under way.\nFinally, pandemics will generate simultaneous demand for vaccines around the world. Clinical and serologic studies will be needed to confirm which populations remain at highest risk once vaccines are available and could form the basis for establishing a globally fair vaccine-allocation system. Some Group of Seven countries have already called for such a global system, whose planning must start while vaccine development proceeds.\nThough it\u2019s unlikely, if the pandemic appears to abruptly end before vaccines are ready, we should continue developing the most promising candidates to a point at which they can be stockpiled and ready for trials and emergency authorization should an outbreak recur. A global financing system that supports end-to-end development and large-scale manufacturing and deployment, ensures fair allocation, and protects private-sector partners from significant financial losses will be a critical component of future pandemic preparedness.\nDisclosure forms provided by the authors are available at NEJM.org.\nThis article was published on March 30, 2020, and last updated on April 24, 2020, at NEJM.org.\nAuthor Affiliations\nFrom the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations, Oslo.\nSupplementary Material\nDisclosure Forms PDF 140KB\nReferences (5)\nCiting Articles (8)", "10.1056/NEJMc2005203": "1 Citing Article\nTO THE EDITOR\nAccording to the World Health Organization (WHO), the case definition for surveillance of returning travelers requires that they need to present with fever and at least one respiratory symptom to be considered as having suspected cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19).1 In their article regarding 1099 patients with laboratory-confirmed Covid-19 at hospitals across China during the first 2 months of the pandemic, Guan et al. (Feb. 28 online publication, available at NEJM.org)2 present compelling data supporting the need for a reassessment of these criteria. The authors found that only 43.8% of the patients presented with fever on admission, although fever developed in 88.7% during hospitalization. That means that if those travelers were returning from affected areas, more than half would not be suspected of having Covid-19, which would result in undetected patients who can spread the virus. This issue may be particularly relevant in low-income countries with less structured health care systems, which could not provide adequate follow-up of these travelers.\nThe study by Guan et al. suggests that fever is not the hallmark of the onset of Covid-19. Other studies have shown rates of fever from 83 to 98% on admission.3,4 We believe that a case definition requiring fever and at least one respiratory symptom may lead to an underdiagnosis of a substantial proportion of patients with early Covid-19 and lead to increased transmission of the virus.\nAlexandre P.

The mortality reported here is not to be confused with the true case fatality ratio, since 93.6% of the patients had not yet reached an outcome at the time of data censoring (January 31). As stated in the WHO consensus with respect to the 2002\u20132003 epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS),1 \u201csimple methods for calculating case fatality ratios from aggregate data will not give reliable estimates during the course of an epidemic.\u201d\nIt is also important to qualify current mortality estimates, which are based on a health system with incredible response capabilities, including entire regions in quarantine2 and expedited building of hospitals. Low- and middle-income countries (85% of the world)3 with already strained health systems should interpret developing data cautiously.

Do the authors have any data regarding the percentage of patients in their study who were receiving angiotensin-receptor blockers (ARBs) or angiotensin-converting\u2013enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and whether such treatment had any effect on the incidence of infection, severity of disease, or their defined primary composite end point of admission to an ICU, the use of mechanical ventilation, or death?\nSince SARS-CoV-2 (the virus causing Covid-19) infects cells through the ACE2 receptor,1-3 the addition of an ARB may decrease the infectivity and potential injury caused by the virus. In addition, the use of an ACE inhibitor may worsen the situation. ARBs do not block the ACE2 receptor well, but there is some crossover, with each individual ARB having a different degree of affinity to the angiotensin II type 1 (AT1) receptor and to the angiotensin II type 2 receptor (AT2)4; ARBs also have an effect on the production of chymase and angiotensin II.5 At this point, do the authors have information on these questions?\nJ.

SARS-CoV-2 uses as its host receptor ACE2,1 which is highly expressed in the lungs and converts angiotensin II (Ang II) to angiotensin 1\u20137 (Ang 1\u20137).2 The axis consisting of ACE2, Ang 1\u20137, and Mas receptor opposes the vasoconstrictive, proinflammatory, and pro-oxidative properties of the ACE\u2013Ang II\u2013AT1 axis.2 Decreased ACE2 levels are reported in patients who have a history of diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, or smoking.2,3 We suspect that virus binding attenuates residual ACE2 activity, which leads to further imbalance between Ang II and Ang 1\u20137. High circulating levels of Ang II induce pulmonary vasoconstriction, which promotes ventilation\u2013perfusion mismatch and increases vascular permeability, inflammation, and oxidative stress and can lead to acute lung injury or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).4 Thus, we encourage investigation of AT1 blockers, Ang 1\u20137, and recombinant ACE2 as potential therapeutic agents to mitigate acute lung injury or ARDS in patients with severe Covid-19.\nBrandon M.

This finding was similar to the result of a study involving 81 patients with varying disease severity showing that approximately 30% of the patients in whom Covid-19 was diagnosed were afebrile on admission.1 Our findings might have been attributable to the variation in the predominant symptoms or signs among the study population and the different timing of examination. As the correspondents point out, fever developed in nearly 90% of the patients in our study during their hospital stay. Therefore, afebrile patients with a recent contact history and radiologic manifestations consistent with atypical pneumonia on admission should be screened for Covid-19 by viral nucleic acid assay of respiratory samples.\nChen and colleagues express concern regarding the validity of the estimated case fatality rate during the epidemic. A more precise estimate could have been derived from a study that included a longer follow-up duration among all study patients. Given the urgency to inform clinicians worldwide, we defined the censoring time as the data cutoff (January 31), when a considerable proportion of the patients remained in the hospital. In spite of this shortcoming, our mortality estimate (1.4%) was close to the national official estimates (2.0 to 3.5%) between February and March.2\nRolf comments on a valuable approach to determine the effect of ARBs on the clinical outcomes of patients with Covid-19. However, given the urgency and the incompleteness of records in some participating sites, plus the variable length of follow-up, our database cannot convincingly address further the potential benefits of this class of medication.\nWe appreciate the suggestions of Henry and Vikse, who propose the use of angiotensin 1 blockers, Ang 1\u20137, and recombinant human ACE2 in patients with Covid-19. We are planning to initiate a clinical trial that compares the effects of an intravenous infusion of recombinant ACE2 (at a dose of 0.4 mg per kilogram of body weight twice daily for 7 days) plus the standard of care, as compared with the standard of care alone, on the time course of body temperature and the dynamics of viral loads (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT04287686\n. opens in new tab\n).

The obstetrical population presents a unique challenge during this pandemic, since these patients have multiple interactions with the health care system and eventually most are admitted to the hospital for delivery. We first diagnosed a case of Covid-19 in an obstetrical patient on March 13, 2020, and we previously reported our early experience with Covid-19 in pregnant women, including two initially asymptomatic women in whom symptoms developed and who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19, after delivery.1,2 After these two cases were identified, we implemented universal testing with nasopharyngeal swabs and a quantitative polymerase-chain-reaction test to detect SARS-CoV-2 infection in women who were admitted for delivery.\nFigure 1.\nSymptom Status and SARS-CoV-2 Test Results among 215 Obstetrical Patients Presenting for Delivery.\nBetween March 22 and April 4, 2020, a total of 215 pregnant women delivered infants at the New York\u2013Presbyterian Allen Hospital and Columbia University Irving Medical Center . All the women were screened on admission for symptoms of Covid-19. Four women (1.9%) had fever or other symptoms of Covid-19 on admission, and all 4 women tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 (Figure 1). Of the 211 women without symptoms, all were afebrile on admission. Nasopharyngeal swabs were obtained from 210 of the 211 women (99.5%) who did not have symptoms of Covid-19; of these women, 29 (13.7%) were positive for SARS-CoV-2. Thus, 29 of the 33 patients who were positive for SARS-CoV-2 at admission (87.9%) had no symptoms of Covid-19 at presentation.\nOf the 29 women who had been asymptomatic but who were positive for SARS-CoV-2 on admission, fever developed in 3 (10%) before postpartum discharge (median length of stay, 2 days). Two of these patients received antibiotics for presumed endomyometritis (although 1 patient did not have localizing symptoms), and 1 patient was presumed to be febrile due to Covid-19 and received supportive care. One patient with a swab that was negative for SARS-CoV-2 on admission became symptomatic postpartum; repeat SARS-CoV-2 testing 3 days after the initial test was positive.\nOur use of universal SARS-CoV-2 testing in all pregnant patients presenting for delivery revealed that at this point in the pandemic in New York City, most of the patients who were positive for SARS-CoV-2 at delivery were asymptomatic, and more than one of eight asymptomatic patients who were admitted to the labor and delivery unit were positive for SARS-CoV-2. Although this prevalence has limited generalizability to geographic regions with lower rates of infection, it underscores the risk of Covid-19 among asymptomatic obstetrical patients. Moreover, the true prevalence of infection may be underreported because of false negative results of tests to detect SARS-CoV-2.3\nThe potential benefits of a universal testing approach include the ability to use Covid-19 status to determine hospital isolation practices and bed assignments, inform neonatal care, and guide the use of personal protective equipment. Access to such clinical data provides an important opportunity to protect mothers, babies, and health care teams during these challenging times.\nDesmond Sutton, M.D.\nKarin Fuchs, M.D., M.H.A.\nMary D\u2019Alton, M.D.\nDena Goffman, M.D.\nColumbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY\ndg2018@cumc.columbia.edu\nDisclosure forms provided by the authors are available with the full text of this letter at NEJM.org.\nThis letter was published on April 13, 2020, at NEJM.org.\n3 References\nSupplementary Material\nDisclosure Forms PDF 180KB", "10.1056/NEJMc2008043": "TO THE EDITOR\nAfter a review of the findings of Cao et al. (published in the Journal online on March 18),1 many clinicians are abandoning the use of lopinavir\u2013ritonavir for the treatment of Covid-19. We consider this action to be premature. It is crucial to realize that although this trial did not show that the time until clinical improvement was meaningfully better than standard care among patients with severe Covid-19 who received lopinavir\u2013ritonavir, the trial was statistically underpowered to show this outcome. In addition, the analyses of secondary outcomes (which still require confirmation) suggested that lopinavir\u2013ritonavir may be associated with substantial lowering of overall mortality (19% in patients in the lopinavir\u2013ritonavir group vs. 25% in the standard-care group), the risk of severe adverse events (20% vs. 32%), and the risk of respiratory failure or acute respiratory distress syndrome (13% vs. 27%). Lopinavir\u2013ritonavir has shown activity against SARS-CoV-12,3 and is available for immediate clinical use in many countries. Because there currently are no approved treatments for Covid-19,4 and because the pandemic diffusion of SARS-CoV-2 is causing shortages of alternative drugs, we should not yet abandon lopinavir\u2013ritonavir. We therefore advocate that therapeutic guidelines retain lopinavir\u2013ritonavir as a treatment option against Covid-19, pending completion of the World Health Organization SOLIDARITY trial.5\nPiero Dalerba, M.D.\nBruce Levin, Ph.D.\nJohn L.

Antiviral drugs are most effective when they are administered early in an infection,1 yet the patients in this trial underwent randomization a median of 13 days after disease onset. Initiating therapy earlier may be more effective, since systemic hyperinflammation rather than viral pathogenicity dominates later stages of SARS-CoV-2 infection.2\nThe enrolled population had severe disease, with an overall mortality of 22%, a factor that may have contributed to the poor effect associated with lopinavir\u2013ritonavir and the high discontinuation rate (14%) because of adverse events. In addition, concurrent therapies were not controlled: one in three patients received glucocorticoids, although the use of these drugs is not recommended,3 since they have been associated with a delay in clearance of other coronaviruses.4 This use may have contributed to the absence of an observed effect on viral loads.\nThe lopinavir\u2013ritonavir combination is relatively safe and could be easily mobilized against Covid-19. Given the urgent need for evidence-based pharmacotherapies, we should not shut the door on further randomized, controlled trials of the early use of this combination drug in other populations.\nKurt M.

Their study, undertaken in desperate times, arguably started patients on medication later than we would today (median, 13 days after symptom onset). In addition, their primary end point (speed to symptom resolution) may not be the best end point, given our knowledge of the natural history of SARS-CoV-2. The survival analysis in the lopinavir\u2013ritonavir group included three patients who never received the medication; after the exclusion of these patients, there would be an absolute increase of almost 10 percentage points in 28-day survival. In addition, a shorter length of hospital stay and time until discharge was observed, although the finding was not statistically significant. With limited access to ventilators and shortages of personal protective equipment, decreasing the length of hospitalization, even by only a day or two, would bring benefits to a distressed health system. We will probably not find a magic bullet for Covid-19 soon, and we should work toward incremental clinical improvements from off-the-shelf interventions evaluated in similar trials.\nDaniel Havlichek, Jr., M.D.\nMichigan State University, East Lansing, MI\nhavliche@msu.edu\nNo potential conflict of interest relevant to this letter was reported.\nThis letter was published on May 5, 2020, at NEJM.org.\nTO THE EDITOR\nIn the trial of lopinavir\u2013ritonavir involving patients with severe Covid-19, Cao et al. conclude that no benefit was observed for the drug combination beyond standard care. This conclusion can certainly mislead clinicians, and a critical appraisal needs to be performed together with an exercise of logic. The results of a trial may have no statistical significance, but signals are important if the sample size is small. In this case, such signals among the patients who received lopinavir\u2013ritonavir were a shorter stay by 5 days in the intensive care unit, a difference of 15.5 percentage points in clinical improvement by day 14, and a lower incidence of 28-day mortality by 5.8 percentage points. To know the appropriate sample size from the raw data of the trial, we must implement the formula for the comparison of two mortality rates.1 Thus, a sample size of 800 patients would be needed to provide the trial with a statistical power of 80%.

We digitalized and reanalyzed the data with a Bayesian Cox proportional-hazards model2,3 and found that there was a 73% posterior probability of a clinical improvement of more than 15% and a 17% probability that the effect was in a region of practical equivalence. Since this trial was underpowered, the results do not sustain the conclusion that lopinavir\u2013ritonavir was ineffective. This drug combination has a well-known safety profile, and in vitro data indicate that it is active against coronavirus.4 At this critical time, even a modest advantage can entail greater availability of crucial material, such as respirators and beds in the intensive care unit.\nAlberto Carmona-Bayonas, M.D., Ph.D.\nHospital Universitario Morales Meseguer, Murcia, Spain\nalberto.carmonabayonas@gmail.com\nPaula Jimenez-Fonseca, M.D., Ph.D.\nHospital Universitario Central de Asturias, Oviedo, Spain\nEduardo Casta\u00f1\u00f3n, M.D., Ph.D.\nCl\u00ednica Universidad de Navarra, Madrid, Spain\nNo potential conflict of interest relevant to this letter was reported.\nThis letter was published on May 5, 2020, at NEJM.org.\n4 References\nRESPONSE\nThe authors reply: Since the publication of the results of our lopinavir\u2013ritonavir trial, we have received emails from around the world. In most of these messages, the correspondents mainly interpreted the results of our trial as showing that lopinavir\u2013ritonavir did not have a beneficial effect. We appreciate the comments of the wise clinicians regarding the uncertainty that remains concerning the clinical effectiveness of lopinavir\u2013ritonavir in Covid-19. Results that are based on different analyses of the data have shown dissimilarity for the primary outcome (time to clinical improvement), which suggests that we should be very cautious in the interpretation of our findings.\nIn the modified intention-to-treat analysis, after the exclusion of three patients who died within 24 hours after randomization and did not receive lopinavir\u2013ritonavir, the time to clinical improvement in the lopinavir\u2013ritonavir group was 1 day shorter than that in the control group. One of the underlying reasons for the lack of statistical significance in the intention-to-treat analysis may have been the small sample size. Furthermore, as several of the correspondents have pointed out, the patients whom we enrolled were severely ill, with a median interval of 13 days between symptom onset and drug administration. The treatment course and dose may not have been optimized. Judging from the preliminary observations in this trial that approximately 45% of the patients in the lopinavir\u2013ritonavir group had positive RNA detected on day 14, we speculate that some patients may need an extended administration of antiviral drugs or that the negative conversion of RNA testing should be considered as a criterion for stopping antiviral treatment.\nGiven the complex nature of Covid-19, we recommend that clinicians review all the data about all the outcomes in our trial (including those provided in the Supplementary Appendix, available with the full text of our article at NEJM.org) before making any clinical decisions regarding treatment. On the basis of the results regarding different outcomes and alternative data analyses, lopinavir\u2013ritonavir may still be a potential therapeutic agent against Covid-19. The World Health Organization is launching a large study with lopinavir\u2013ritonavir as one of the treatments.1 We believe that additional trials with a larger sample size involving patients with milder disease, earlier drug administration, and an extended treatment course may be helpful in further evaluating the effectiveness of lopinavir\u2013ritonavir against Covid-19.\nBin Cao, M.D.\nChina\u2013Japan Friendship Hospital, Beijing, China\ncaobin_ben@163.com\nDingyu Zhang, M.D.\nJin Yin-tan Hospital, Wuhan, China\nChen Wang, M.D.\nChina\u2013Japan Friendship Hospital, Beijing, China\nSince publication of their article, the authors report no further potential conflict of interest.\nThis letter was published on May 5, 2020, at NEJM.org.\n1 Reference", "10.1056/NEJMc2011599": "Comment\nComments open through May 27, 2020\nTo rapidly communicate short reports of innovative responses to Covid-19 around the world, along with a range of current thinking on policy and strategy relevant to the pandemic, the Journal has initiated the Covid-19 Notes series.\nLombardy, and particularly the province of Bergamo, has been the area of Italy most affected by Covid-19. As of April 26, 2020, the province had 11,113 confirmed cases and 2932 deaths from Covid-19. Delays in recognizing SARS-CoV-2 in the few infected patients admitted to the small hospital in Alzano Lombardo \u2014 and delays in activating measures to protect other patients, hospital personnel, and visitors, as well as in implementing adequate containment measures in patients\u2019 villages \u2014 allowed the virus to spread rapidly and into the city of Bergamo. The province was not locked down until March 8, which was 2 weeks after the first documented cases at the Alzano hospital on February 23. By then, the virus had sickened thousands of people, many of whom visited the emergency department (ED) at ASST\u2013Papa Giovanni XXIII, a referral hospital for high-need patients throughout the province, and were admitted. These patients rapidly overwhelmed the hospital\u2019s capacity, forcing a major reorganization led by a crisis team established on February 23. The infectious disease unit was reconfigured to treat only patients with Covid-19, and other patients were redistributed throughout the hospital or, when possible, discharged.\nDozens of patients were admitted each day, and the number of daily admissions continuously increased. To separate patients with Covid-19 from other patients, it was necessary to create Covid-19 units in both adult and pediatric internal medicine and surgery departments, intensive care units (ICUs), the subintensive critical care area, and the ED. On March 28, patients with Covid-19 occupied 498 of the hospital\u2019s 779 beds. Of these patients, 92 were admitted to ICUs and 12 to the subintensive critical care area.\nFigure 1.\nAvailability of ICU Beds for Patients with Covid-19 and Hospitalization Trends in the ICU, February 23 through April 27, 2020.\nAt the beginning of the outbreak, 25% of staff doctors (regardless of their specialty) were redeployed to Covid-19 units, a figure that progressively increased to 70% during the following weeks. Peer education on Covid-19 management was provided to all hospital personnel; more than 1500 people were trained in 1 week. The exponential increase in cases of acute respiratory failure during the first 2 weeks forced ICUs to reorganize, increase their number of beds dedicated to patients with Covid-19 (Figure 1), and create mixed teams of intensivists. By March 9, there were 49 ICU patients who needed mechanical ventilatory support. This development necessitated the relocation of 14 mechanical ventilators from operating theaters, and 29 additional ventilators were donated by Lombardy\u2019s regional health organization.\nDifficult decisions about which patients would be assigned ventilators were made using a cumulative patient score that took into account the urgency of each patient\u2019s need and the patient\u2019s chance of benefiting from treatment. Anesthesiologists and intensivists cancelled most elective surgeries, including almost all transplants, with the exception of one lung transplant that was performed in a severely ill patient (who had previously been on the waiting list) when a suitable donor became available. Two of the 28 operating theaters remained open nonstop for urgent general and cardiac surgeries, and the hospital continued to provide nondeferrable outpatient services. Of the first 510 patients with confirmed Covid-19 who were admitted, 30% died. After weeks of work by doctors and nurses, total hospital mortality has dropped from an average of 17 to 18 (and a peak of 19) deaths per day to 2 deaths per day, which is similar to the average of 2.5 deaths per day recorded before Covid-19.\nTwo major lessons can be learned from Bergamo\u2019s experience. First, all health care workers in hospitals, nursing homes, and the community should have been tested for Covid-19, and those testing positive should have been isolated, even if they were asymptomatic. Clinicians were initially overlooked during attempts to identify and isolate infected people, which were focused on sick patients. For this reason, and because complete personal protective equipment was not made immediately available, especially to family physicians, 19 doctors in the Bergamo province (all between 62 and 74 years of age) have died. They were all involved in the care of patients with Covid-19, though none worked at ASST\u2013Papa Giovanni XXIII. The second, even more important lesson is that an urgent and decisive regionwide lockdown should have been implemented to contain the epidemic. This step could have reduced the number of Covid-19 cases, prevented hospitals from being overwhelmed, and potentially limited the number of deaths in the province.\nStefano Fagiuoli, M.D.\nFerdinando Luca Lorini, M.D.\nASST\u2013Papa Giovanni XXIII, Bergamo, Italy\nGiuseppe Remuzzi, M.D.\nIstituto di Ricerche Farmacologiche Mario Negri IRCCS, Bergamo, Italy\nfor the Covid-19 Bergamo Hospital Crisis Unit\nDisclosure forms provided by the authors are available with the full text of this note at NEJM.org.\nThis note was published on May 5, 2020, at NEJM.org.\nWe acknowledge the many brave and committed physicians, nurses, and other hospital staff who worked tirelessly through the events reported here.\nSupplementary Material\nDisclosure Forms PDF 163KB\nComment", "10.1056/NEJMc2004794": "TO THE EDITOR\nHolshue et al. (March 5 issue)1 describe the management of the first case of Covid-19 in the United States. We disagree that remdesivir should be used on the 11th day after the onset of symptoms. Few data on the viral load kinetics in patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, the cause of Covid-19, are available.2 However, a study of changes in viral load over time in patients with severe Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus3 showed that copies of RNA peaked before the 11th day of illness. We doubt that the dramatic improvement in the clinical condition of the patient described by Holshue et al. was associated with remdesivir. Readers may have a very misleading impression that remdesivir should be administered as a salvage therapy for Covid-19.\nWe do agree that randomized, controlled trials are needed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of remdesivir. However, in a clinical trial of therapies for Ebola virus disease that was terminated early, the mortality in the remdesivir group was significantly higher than that in the other groups.4 More safety information should be disclosed by the pharmaceutical industry before a new trial of remdesivir is launched,5 since most cases of Covid-19 are mild or moderate.\nLi Weng, M.D.\nYang Jiao, M.D., M.P.H.\nYue Li, M.D.\nPeking Union Medical College Hospital, Beijing, China\nwengli@gmail.com\nNo potential conflict of interest relevant to this letter was reported.\nThis letter was published on April 22, 2020, at NEJM.org.\n5 References\nTO THE EDITOR\nIn the recent case report describing the clinical recovery of the first patient infected with SARS-CoV-2 in the United States, the likelihood of antiviral immunity that may have been in play was not considered. The clinical data presented in the report showed a rebound of lymphocyte counts on hospital day 5 (illness day 9), preceding the subsequent clinical recovery of the patient. This rebound is consistent with activation of adaptive immunity and resolution of viral infection. The patient received an experimental drug (remdesivir) on hospital day 7 (illness day 11), and the subsequent recovery the next day is therefore most likely the result of antiviral immunity.\nIn Wuhan, China, many patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection who did not receive specific antiviral therapy had a clinical course of recovery from the infection that was similar to that described by Holshue et al. The report by Holshue and colleagues has created a tremendous social outcry in China, and there have been calls for the immediate use of remdesivir in the current epidemic. This reported case should be interpreted carefully, and the potential effect of this drug on early activation of antiviral immunity should be carefully studied before it is used in the field.\nKangla Tsung, Ph.D.\nBldg. 16, No. 101, 6 Xierqizhonglu Rd., Beijing, China\nkangla.tsung@gmail.com\nNo potential conflict of interest relevant to this letter was reported.\nThis letter was published on April 22, 2020, at NEJM.org.\nTO THE EDITOR\nHolshue et al. report the first case of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the United States. Notably, gastrointestinal symptoms were observed. In addition, the results of real-time reverse-transcriptase\u2013polymerase-chain-reaction (rRT-PCR) testing of a stool specimen obtained from the patient were positive for SARS-CoV-2. The presentation and findings in this patient are consistent with those of some patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection in China.\nFurthermore, SARS-CoV-2 has been reported to bind to the functional receptor ACE2.1 The Human Protein Atlas (www.proteinatlas.org\n. opens in new tab\n)2 indicates that ACE2 is specifically expressed and detected in the gastrointestinal tract, gallbladder, kidneys, testes, and heart muscle. Given the widespread distribution of ACE2 in human tissues, these results suggest extrapulmonary manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 infection.3\nCan the authors provide the rRT-PCR results from the stool specimen obtained from the patient after treatment or other samples such as urine specimens? These findings may help clinicians determine the potential transmissibility of the virus from \u201ccured\u201d patients with oropharyngeal specimens that are negative for SARS-CoV-2, and they may inform the full spectrum of transmission routes. Also, although ACE2 is highly expressed in various tissues, no significant, tissue-specific, expression quantitative trait loci for ACE2 in the five mentioned tissues with high ACE2 expression have been detected in the GTEx Portal (gtexportal.org\n. opens in new tab\n)4; this suggests the universal susceptibility of the general population to SARS-CoV-2.\nYue-miao Zhang, M.D., Ph.D.\nPeking University First Hospital, Beijing, China\nzhangyuemiao@bjmu.edu.cn\nNo potential conflict of interest relevant to this letter was reported.\nThis letter was published on April 22, 2020, at NEJM.org.\n4 References\nTO THE EDITOR\nIn the meticulous description of the first case of Covid-19 in the United States, the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in a stool specimen obtained from the patient arouses serious concern. Can SARS-CoV-2 be transmitted through the fecal\u2013oral route? There is a high degree of similarity in the genomic structures of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-1, and fecal\u2013oral transmission was recognized in the SARS pandemic in 2003\u20132004.1\nSARS-CoV-2 has been reported to use the same receptor (ACE2) as SARS-CoV-1 uses to enter target cells.2 ACE2 protein is expressed abundantly in pneumocytes as well as on the brush border of all kinds of enterocytes in the small intestine,3 and active SARS-CoV replication has been detected in these cells in patients with SARS infection.4,5 Therefore, it is reasonable to speculate that the fecal\u2013oral transmission of SARS-CoV-2 cannot be ruled out, and given the potential importance of such transmission in the spread and control of the ongoing pandemic, urgent research on this subject is imperative.\nQianjun Wen, Ph.D., M.D.\nJing Yang, M.D.\nTianyong Luo, M.D.\nAffiliated Hospital of Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang City, China\nwqjtmmu@126.com\nNo potential conflict of interest relevant to this letter was reported.\nThis letter was published on April 22, 2020, at NEJM.org.\n5 References\nTO THE EDITOR\nSARS-CoV-2 infection is a global threat that has had a dramatic effect on health care systems. Holshue et al. describe the first patient with Covid-19 in the United States with stool specimens that tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Although the viral load in these specimens was more than 1000 times as low as the viral load in nasopharyngeal swabs, there is a possibility of fecal\u2013oral transmission, which is of relevance for fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT).\nDeFilipp et al.1 recently reported deadly transmission of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase\u2013producing Escherichia coli after FMT. Fresh and frozen specimens are considered equally for treatment of Clostridioides difficile infection.2 In this regard, it is clear that all FMT centers must consider potential Covid-19 infection in donor specimens. First, an emerging shift from the use of fresh to frozen feces with a mandatory observation time may be necessary to increase the safety of FMT. Second, it may be necessary to consider that donors may be oligosymptomatic or asymptomatic persons with Covid-19.3 The travel history of donors and targeted testing may also be considered. Although this alert may be of less importance for countries with a low incidence of Covid-19 than for countries with a higher incidence, the outbreak may lead to a temporary shutdown of FMT centers in China and around the world.\nAlexander Link, M.D., Ph.D.\nOtto von Guericke University, Magdeburg, Germany\nalexander.link@med.ovgu.de\nGeorgina Hold, Ph.D.\nUniversity of New South Wales, Sydney, NSW, Australia\nDr. Link reports receiving grants from the European Regional Development Fund of the European Commission; and Dr. Hold, receiving personal fees from Ferring Pharmaceuticals and fees for serving on a scientific advisory board from EnteroBiotix.

In this patient, chest radiography was routinely performed to diagnose and evaluate damage from SARS-CoV-2 infection and recovery of the patient\u2019s lungs. However, in Wuhan and elsewhere in China, chest computed tomography (CT) has been thought to be more accurate than chest radiography for the early diagnosis of Covid-19.1-3\nMoreover, in samples obtained from asymptomatic persons and carriers with mild symptoms, rRT-PCR assays to detect SARS-CoV-2 often have false negative results. In China, chest CT has been used before confirmation of the pathogen to increase the clinical diagnosis of Covid-19 and to achieve early control of human-to-human transmission in areas where the infection is epidemic.4 For patients with fever in whom Covid-19 is suspected in the United States, we recommend high-resolution low-dose chest CT rather than only chest radiography, which could miss early lesions caused by the virus and lead to radiation-associated injury.\nChuanli Ren, M.D., Ph.D.\nHui Chen, M.D., Ph.D.\nClinical Medical College of Yangzhou University, Yangzhou, China\nrenchl@163.com\nHou-Zao Chen, M.D., Ph.D.\nChinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Beijing, China\nNo potential conflict of interest relevant to this letter was reported.\nThis letter was published on April 22, 2020, at NEJM.org.\n4 References\nRESPONSE\nThe authors reply: Weng et al. question the clinical benefit of remdesivir treatment. In our article, we noted that the decision to administer remdesivir for compassionate use was based on the patient\u2019s worsening clinical status. No inferences are possible from the uncontrolled treatment of one patient, and we stated, \u201crandomized, controlled trials are needed to determine the safety and efficacy of remdesivir and any other investigational agents for treatment of patients with 2019-nCoV infection.\u201d\nTsung notes that an increase in lymphocyte counts and subsequent clinical improvement are consistent with activation of the adaptive immune response and resolution of SARS-CoV-2 infection. IgM and IgA antibodies may be detectable early in the clinical course, and IgG antibodies can be detected a median of 14 days after the onset of illness.1 We agree that the adaptive immune response contributes to clinical recovery and clearance of SARS-CoV-2, although one study showed that seroconversion was not correlated with a rapid decline in the SARS-CoV-2 load.2 In another study that showed a good correlation between IgG and neutralizing antibody titers, an increase in IgG antibody levels was correlated with a decrease in the viral load between 1 and 3 weeks after the onset of illness, but SARS-CoV-2 RNA was still detectable for prolonged periods.3\nZhang inquires about detection of SARS-CoV-2 in stool and urine specimens after remdesivir treatment. In our patient, although a stool specimen collected on day 7 of illness was positive with high cycle threshold values (36 to 38) that were consistent with detection of viral RNA and probably not infectious virus, a stool specimen obtained from the patient on day 14 of illness was negative. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was not detected in urine specimens; these findings are consistent with those in a larger study.4\nWen et al. and Link and Hold raise the issue of fecal\u2013oral transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Diarrhea has been reported to occur in patients with Covid-19, and it can precede the development of respiratory symptoms and progression to pneumonia. SARS-CoV-2 RNA has been detected in stool specimens, and recovery of live infectious virus from stool has been reported.4 Further studies are needed to understand the implications of SARS-CoV-2 detected in stool for transmission of the virus.\nRen et al. argue that high-resolution low-dose chest CT should be performed instead of chest radiography in persons with fever and suspected Covid-19. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends collection of nasopharyngeal swab specimens and lower respiratory specimens, if available, for SARS-CoV-2 testing and prioritizes testing of hospitalized patients and symptomatic health care workers. Furthermore, the American College of Radiology has noted concerns regarding prevention and control of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in health care facilities, including transmission that may occur with the use of CT scanners, and has recommended that CT should not be used to screen for or diagnose Covid-19.5\nTimothy M.

By February 10, there were 28 cases of laboratory-confirmed coronavirus 2019 (Covid-19, the illness caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection) in South Korea (Fig. S1 in the Supplementary Appendix, available with the full text of this letter at NEJM.org). The characteristics of these patients1 and the patient numbers are provided in Table S1. The median age of the patients was 41 years (range, 21 to 73), and 15 of the 28 patients (54%) were men. The mean interval (\u00b1SD) from symptom onset to diagnosis was 4.3\u00b14.1 days.\nEleven cases of Covid-19 were acquired locally and involved delayed diagnosis. Delays in detection of infected patients may be related to subclinical symptoms and diverse initial manifestations that make it difficult for clinicians to diagnose Covid-19. Eight of 20 patients who reported specified symptoms (40%) initially presented with fever, and respiratory symptoms were nonspecific. Some patients reported severe sore throat, whereas others had only a mild cough.\nMost of the early local infections were transmitted from patients who were being actively monitored because of recent travel (Patients 3, 5, and 6). Patient 3, who had subclinical symptoms, transmitted SARS-CoV-2 infection to Patient 6, who in turn transmitted it to Patients 10, 11, and 21. During his stay in Japan, Patient 12 had been exposed to a person with confirmed Covid-19. However, he was not screened in the quarantine area at Gimpo International Airport in Seoul, South Korea, because South Korean officials had not been informed about the contact. Patient 12 appears to have subsequently infected Patient 14.\nControl strategies for outbreaks of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection have focused on tracing contacts of symptomatic patients with epidemiologic links. However, during the 2015 MERS-CoV outbreak in South Korea, nosocomial transmission persisted despite active quarantine measures.2 Early data suggest that SARS-CoV-2 infection is more likely to be transmitted than MERS-CoV infection because of a higher estimated reproductive number (2.2 vs. 0.9) and a shorter estimated serial interval distribution (7.5 days vs. 12.6 days).3,4\nAmong the 28 infected patients reported here, Covid-19 was diagnosed by surveillance testing in South Korea in 3 who were asymptomatic. Although asymptomatic transmission has been suggested, it is uncertain when patients with Covid-19 are infectious during the incubation period or whether they are infectious primarily when they have symptoms.5 Better assessments of viral shedding are needed to properly inform our understanding of transmission dynamics and infection-control practices. Early detection of Covid-19 is difficult because of its apparent subclinical nature in some persons.\nJoon-Young Song, M.D., Ph.D.\nJin-Gu Yun, M.D., Ph.D.\nJi-Yun Noh, M.D., Ph.D.\nHee-Jin Cheong, M.D., Ph.D.\nWoo-Joo Kim, M.D., Ph.D.\nKorea University College of Medicine, Seoul, South Korea\nheejinmd@korea.ac.kr\nDisclosure forms provided by the authors are available with the full text of this letter at NEJM.org.\nThis letter was published on April 6, 2020, at NEJM.org.\n5 References\nSupplementary Material\nSupplementary Appendix PDF 171KB\nDisclosure Forms PDF 187KB\nCiting Article (1)", "10.1056/NEJMc2010418": "TO THE EDITOR:\nDespite the risk of rapid respiratory failure1 and cardiac complications2 due to Covid-19, it is unclear whether there is an association between Covid-19 and out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. The Lombardy region of Italy was among the first areas to have an outbreak of Covid-19 outside China,3 and the first case there was diagnosed on February 20, 2020, in Lodi Province.4\nUsing the Lombardia Cardiac Arrest Registry (Lombardia CARe), we compared out-of-hospital cardiac arrests that occurred in the provinces of Lodi, Cremona, Pavia, and Mantua during the first 40 days of the Covid-19 outbreak (February 21 through March 31, 2020) with those that occurred during the same period in 2019 (February 21 through April 1, to account for the leap year). We reviewed daily reports of new Covid-19 cases recorded by the National Department of Civil Protection5 and cases of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest in the electronic database of the emergency medical system to identify either symptoms suggestive of Covid-19 (fever lasting \u22653 days before out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, with cough, dyspnea, or both) or positive results of testing to detect SARS-CoV-2 in pharyngeal swabs obtained before the out-of-hospital cardiac arrest or after death. (Details are provided in the Supplementary Appendix, available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org.)\nDuring the study period in 2020, a total of 9806 cases of Covid-19 were reported in the study territory. During this period, 362 cases of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest were identified, as compared with 229 cases identified during the same period in 2019 (a 58% increase). Increases of various magnitudes in the numbers of cases of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest were seen in all four provinces (Table S1 in the Supplementary Appendix). The sex and age of the patients were similar in the 2020 and 2019 periods, but in 2020, the incidence of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest due to a medical cause was 6.5 percentage points higher, the incidence of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest at home was 7.3 percentage points higher, and the incidence of unwitnessed cardiac arrest was 11.3 percentage points higher (Table S2). The median arrival time of the emergency medical service was 3 minutes longer in 2020 than in 2019, and the proportion of patients who received cardiopulmonary resuscitation from bystanders was 15.6 percentage points lower. Among patients in whom resuscitation was attempted by the emergency medical service, the incidence of out-of-hospital death was 14.9 percentage points higher in 2020 than in 2019.\nFigure 1.\nCumulative Incidences of Diagnosed Covid-19 and Cases of Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest (OHCA) in Four Provinces in Lombardy, Italy, during the 40 days after February 20 in 2019 and 2020.\nThe cumulative incidence of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest in 2020 was strongly associated with the cumulative incidence of Covid-19 (Spearman rank correlation coefficient, 0.87; 95% confidence interval, 0.83 to 0.91; P<0.001), and the increase in the number of cases of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest over the number in 2019 (133 additional cases) followed the time course of the Covid-19 outbreak (Figure 1). A total of 103 patients who had out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (Table S3) were suspected to have or had received a diagnosis of Covid-19 (87 and 16 patients, respectively); these numbers account for 77.4% of the increase in cases of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest observed in these provinces in 2020.\nEnrico Baldi, M.D.\nUniversity of Pavia, Pavia, Italy\nGiuseppe M.

Nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs were obtained to test for influenza, Covid-19, and other respiratory viral infections; all tests except Covid-19 were negative within 6 hours. The patient was admitted to a private regular hospital room.\nSupportive care was implemented because the patient\u2019s history and findings on chest radiography were consistent with Covid-19. On hospital day 2, painful, irregular contractions began and labor was augmented with oxytocin. During her labor course, tests for Covid-19 were determined to be positive 21 hours after samples were obtained. Other than a transient temperature increase to 38.5\u00b0C just before delivery, which resolved without treatment, she had an uncomplicated spontaneous vaginal delivery on hospital day 3, with Apgar scores of 8 and 9. Delayed cord clamping was not performed, and skin-to-skin contact between the mother and infant was not permitted. There was no evidence of neonatal or intraamniotic infection. After delivery, the neonate was placed in a radiant warmer bed away from the mother and was moved to a separate room once the condition was stabilized, to remain there until discharge. The neonate was nourished with formula and expressed breast milk.\nDuring the postpartum period, contact between the staff and the patient was minimized and at times involved the use of a telephone. She felt well and was discharged home with the neonate on hospital day 6. Telephone follow-up after delivery indicated there were no signs of neonatal infection. Her husband had also tested positive for Covid-19.\nThis case describes uncomplicated labor and vaginal delivery in a woman with Covid-19. Care was taken to avoid infecting hospital staff, and 7 days after the delivery, no caregivers appeared to be infected.

(published Feb. 19 at NEJM.org),1 cases of Covid-19 (the illness caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection) with no epidemiologic link to travel to China or known cases outside China have caused international concern about undetected introduction of the virus from subclinical infection. It is also possible that local zoonotic spillover of this coronavirus from an intermediate animal reservoir or reservoirs into human populations might have occurred, particularly in Southeast Asia.\nFor example, coronaviruses that are phylogenetically close to SARS-CoV-2 have been detected in pangolins (scaly anteaters),2 especially in Malayan pangolins (also known as Sunda pangolins) that are obtained in antismuggling operations in Guangdong Province and the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region in China.3 This species, which is located throughout Southeast Asia, is thus currently considered to be a potential intermediate host of SARS-CoV-2. In addition, a recent phyloepidemiologic analysis suggested that the Covid-19 outbreak did not arise from a \u201cBig Bang\u201d\u2013like event at Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market in Wuhan, China, but rather it may have originated elsewhere and probably involved more than one zoonotic spillover.4 Finally, a person with a confirmed case of Covid-19 in Shanghai was probably infected by consuming bush meat (i.e., wild animals hunted for food) while traveling in Guangdong Province in China.5\nTaken together, the possibility of novel coronavirus spillover to humans in Southeast Asia cannot be ruled out. Surveillance to detect coronaviruses in pangolins is needed to address this concern.\nXiaodong Zhang, Ph.D.\nJilin University, Changchun, China\nzhang_xd@jlu.edu.cn\nNo potential conflict of interest relevant to this letter was reported.\nThis letter was published on March 27, 2020, at NEJM.org.\n5 References\nRESPONSE\nThe authors reply: Zhang hypothesizes that Covid-19 cases continue to occur from repeated zoonotic spillover events from pangolins to humans. There are several ways to distinguish repeated spillover events from human-to-human transmission. Genomic sequencing of animal and human isolates as well as observational studies,1 case\u2013control studies,2 and modeling can distinguish the number of independent introductions from animals to humans.3 Zhang\u2019s citations neither support nor refute the spillover hypothesis, whereas sequencing data provide support for worldwide human-to-human transmission.4 Nevertheless, we agree that surveillance to detect spillover events is important.\nSince our Perspective article about Covid-19 was published, much has been learned about case fatality rates, transmission, asymptomatic cases, and risk factors for severe disease and death. We have seen marked declines in transmission in some areas. Now is the time to conduct community household serosurveys to answer two important outstanding questions: How many infections are out there, going undetected? And what level of population-wide immunity is being attained? The answers to those questions have worldwide implications.\nDavid L.

The case reports should be viewed as observations rather than as recommendations for evaluation or treatment. In the interest of timeliness, these reports are evaluated by in-house editors, with peer review reserved for key points as needed.\nWe report five cases of large-vessel stroke in patients younger than 50 years of age who presented to our health system in New York City. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection was diagnosed in all five patients.\nTable 1.\nClinical Characteristics of Five Young Patients Presenting with Large-Vessel Stroke.\nCough, headache, and chills lasting 1 week developed in a previously healthy 33-year-old woman (Patient 1) (Table 1). She then had progressive dysarthria with both numbness and weakness in the left arm and left leg over a period of 28 hours. She delayed seeking emergency care because of fear of Covid-19. When she presented to the hospital, the score on the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) was 19 (scores range from 0 to 42, with higher numbers indicating greater stroke severity), and computed tomography (CT) and CT angiography showed a partial infarction of the right middle cerebral artery with a partially occlusive thrombus in the right carotid artery at the cervical bifurcation. Patchy ground-glass opacities in bilateral lung apices were seen on CT angiography, and testing to detect SARS-CoV-2 was positive. Antiplatelet therapy was initiated; it was subsequently switched to anticoagulation therapy. Stroke workup with echocardiography and magnetic resonance imaging of the head and neck did not reveal the source of the thrombus. Repeat CT angiography on hospital day 10 showed complete resolution of the thrombus, and the patient was discharged to a rehabilitation facility.\nOver a 2-week period from March 23 to April 7, 2020, a total of five patients (including the aforementioned patient) who were younger than 50 years of age presented with new-onset symptoms of large-vessel ischemic stroke. All five patients tested positive for Covid-19. By comparison, every 2 weeks over the previous 12 months, our service has treated, on average, 0.73 patients younger than 50 years of age with large-vessel stroke.\nOn admission of the five patients, the mean NIHSS score was 17, consistent with severe large-vessel stroke. One patient had a history of stroke. Other pertinent clinical characteristics are summarized in Table 1.\nA retrospective study of data from the Covid-19 outbreak in Wuhan, China, showed that the incidence of stroke among hospitalized patients with Covid-19 was approximately 5%; the youngest patient in that series was 55 years of age.1 Moreover, large-vessel stroke was reported in association with the 2004 SARS-CoV-1 outbreak in Singapore.2 Coagulopathy and vascular endothelial dysfunction have been proposed as complications of Covid-19.3 The association between large-vessel stroke and Covid-19 in young patients requires further investigation.\nSocial distancing, isolation, and reluctance to present to the hospital may contribute to poor outcomes. Two patients in our series delayed calling an ambulance because they were concerned about going to a hospital during the pandemic.\nThomas J. Oxley, M.D.\nJ.

Here, we describe our experience in the initial month of the Covid-19 outbreak in New York City.\nPatients with confirmed Covid-19 who had ST-segment elevation on electrocardiography were included in the study from six New York hospitals. Patients with Covid-19 who had nonobstructive disease on coronary angiography or had normal wall motion on echocardiography in the absence of angiography were presumed to have noncoronary myocardial injury.\nTable 1.\nCharacteristics of 18 Patients with Covid-19 with ST-Segment Elevation on Electrocardiography.\nWe identified 18 patients with Covid-19 who had ST-segment elevation indicating potential acute myocardial infarction (Fig. S1 in the Supplementary Appendix, available with the full text of this letter at NEJM.org). The median age of the patients was 63 years, 83% were men, and 33% had chest pain around the time of ST-segment elevation (Table 1). A total of 10 patients (56%) had ST-segment elevation at the time of presentation, and the other 8 patients had development of ST-segment elevation during hospitalization (median, 6 days) (Fig. S2A).\nOf 14 patients (78%) with focal ST-segment elevation, 5 (36%) had a normal left ventricular ejection fraction, of whom 1 (20%) had a regional wall-motion abnormality; 8 patients (57%) had a reduced left ventricular ejection fraction, of whom 5 (62%) had regional wall-motion abnormalities. (One patient did not have an echocardiogram.) Of the 4 patients (22% of the overall population) with diffuse ST-segment elevation, 3 (75%) had a normal left ventricular ejection fraction and normal wall motion; 1 patient had a left ventricular ejection fraction of 10% with global hypokinesis.\nA total of 9 patients (50%) underwent coronary angiography; 6 of these patients (67%) had obstructive disease, and 5 (56%) underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (1 after the administration of fibrinolytic agents) (Fig. S3). The relationship among electrocardiographic, echocardiographic, and angiographic findings are summarized in Figure S4. The 8 patients (44%) who received a clinical diagnosis of myocardial infarction had higher median peak troponin and d-dimer levels than the 10 patients (56%) with noncoronary myocardial injury (Fig. S2B and S2C). A total of 13 patients (72%) died in the hospital (4 patients with myocardial infarction and 9 with noncoronary myocardial injury).\nIn this series of patients with Covid-19 who had ST-segment elevation, there was variability in presentation, a high prevalence of nonobstructive disease, and a poor prognosis. Half the patients underwent coronary angiography, of whom two thirds had obstructive disease. Of note, all 18 patients had elevated d-dimer levels. In contrast, in a previous study involving patients who presented with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction, 64% had normal d-dimer levels.1 Myocardial injury in patients with Covid-19 could be due to plaque rupture, cytokine storm, hypoxic injury, coronary spasm, microthrombi, or direct endothelial or vascular injury.2 Myocardial interstitial edema has been shown on magnetic resonance imaging in such patients.3\nSripal Bangalore, M.D., M.H.A.\nAtul Sharma, M.D.\nAlexander Slotwiner, M.D.\nNew York University Grossman School of Medicine, New York, NY\nsripalbangalore@gmail.com\nLeonid Yatskar, M.D.\nNew York City Health and Hospitals\u2013Elmhurst, New York, NY\nRafael Harari, M.D.\nNew York University Grossman School of Medicine, New York, NY\nBinita Shah, M.D.\nVA New York Harbor Healthcare System, New York, NY\nHomam Ibrahim, M.D.\nNew York University Grossman School of Medicine, New York, NY\nGary H.

Eighteen of the health care workers were from Wuhan, 4 were from areas of Hubei Province outside Wuhan, and 1 was from Hainan Province (see Table S1 in the Supplementary Appendix, available with the full text of this letter at NEJM.org). Eleven of these persons had been rehired after retirement, and at least 5 were known to have had a chronic condition such as hypertension, atrial fibrillation, or post-polio syndrome. Thirteen were physicians who provided direct patient care (5 practiced in community health centers or in private clinics, 3 practiced Chinese medicine, 2 were internal medicine physicians, 2 were physicians in respiratory medicine, and 1 was a gastroenterologist); 8 were surgeons (including 3 ophthalmologic surgeons); 1 was an electrocardiography technician; and 1 was a nurse.\nThe median period from the onset of symptoms of Covid-19 to hospital admission in the 19 health care workers for whom these data were available was 6 days (range, 0 to 15).3 Three of them died in late January, 17 died in February, and 3 died in early March. The median period from hospital admission to death in all 23 health care workers was 19 days (range, 1 to 47). In 16 of the health care workers, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) rapidly progressed, and their condition then deteriorated quickly; all but 3 of these persons were 50 years of age or older. After their condition deteriorated, 12 of the 23 health care workers were transferred from the hospitals where they were first admitted to specialized intensive care units in other hospitals or to hospitals that specialize in infectious diseases. In addition to ARDS, the complications of Covid-19 in these patients included cardiac injury, septic shock, multiple organ dysfunction syndrome, hypercoagulability, intracardiac thrombus, and bacteremia.\nOnly 2 of the 23 health care workers were physicians in respiratory medicine who had been specifically assigned to treat patients with Covid-19. None of the 23 patients who died were from hospital divisions of infectious diseases or worked in hospitals that specialized in infectious diseases. The infections in these patients may have resulted from inadequate precautions and insufficient protection in the early stages of the epidemic.\nAs of March 31, none of the 42,600 health care workers who went to Hubei Province to care for patients with Covid-19 were known to have been infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).5 The 42,600 workers included one of us, an intensive care physician from Fujian Province who cared for patients with Covid-19 from January 29 to March 23, first in Wuhan Central Hospital, and then in Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital. These data suggest that sufficient precautions with rigorous enforcement can prevent health care workers from becoming infected with SARS-CoV-2 and the subsequent risk of death.

The study was approved by the ethics committee of Tongji Hospital. Among the 366 children, the most frequently detected pathogens were influenza A virus (in 23 patients [6.3%]) and influenza B virus (in 20 [5.5%]). SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19, was detected in 6 patients (1.6%). Informed consent was obtained from the parents or guardians of the patients with Covid-19 for the publication of their clinical data. The dates of illness onset in the six patients with Covid-19 were between January 2 and January 8, 2020, and the patients were hospitalized between January 7 and January 13 (Fig. S2). Details of the study methods are provided in the Supplementary Appendix.\nTable 1.\nSummary of the Clinical Characteristics of Six Children with Covid-19.\nThe median age of the six patients was 3 years (range, 1 to 7) (Table 1). All six children had previously been completely healthy. Common clinical characteristics included high fever (>39\u00b0C) (in all six patients), cough (in all six), and vomiting (in four). Laboratory investigations showed that the levels of lymphocytes, white cells, and neutrophils were below the normal range in six, four, and three patients, respectively. Four of the six patients had pneumonia, as assessed radiographically, with computed tomographic scans of the chest showing typical viral pneumonia patterns (Fig. S3). One child was admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit (ICU) and received pooled immune globulin from healthy donors. All the patients were treated empirically with antiviral agents, antibiotic agents, and supportive therapies. All the patients recovered after hospitalization for a median of 7.5 days (range, 5 to 13).\nThis study showed that Covid-19 occurred in children, causing moderate-to-severe respiratory illness, in the early phase of the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in Wuhan and was associated with ICU admission in one patient. None of the patients or their family members had had direct exposure to Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market (the initial location to which cases of Covid-19 were linked) or to one another. It is worth mentioning that we unexpectedly found a case of Covid-19 in one patient (Patient 3) who resided outside Wuhan; this patient had illness onset on January 2, 2020. The patient and her family were residents of the Yangxin area of Huangshi and had not traveled outside the city in the month before illness onset. We have not identified the source of infection for this patient. Our findings indicate that SARS-CoV-2 infections in children were occurring early in the epidemic.4\nWeiyong Liu, Ph.D.\nTongji Hospital of Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China\nQi Zhang, Ph.D.\nWuhan University, Wuhan, China\nJunbo Chen, Ph.D.\nFudan University, Shanghai, China\nRong Xiang, Ph.D.\nCentral South University, Changsha, China\nHuijuan Song, M.Sc.\nSainan Shu, M.D.\nLing Chen, M.D.\nTongji Hospital of Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China\nLu Liang, M.D.\nSichuan University, Chengdu, China\nJiaxin Zhou, M.D.\nLei You, M.Sc.\nFudan University, Shanghai, China\nPeng Wu, Ph.D.\nUniversity of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China\nBo Zhang, M.Sc.\nYanjun Lu, Ph.D.\nLiming Xia, M.D.\nLu Huang, M.D.\nTongji Hospital of Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China\nYang Yang, Ph.D.\nFang Liu, Ph.D.\nWuhan University, Wuhan, China\nMalcolm G.

Amid flashbacks to the fearsome severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic in 2002\u20132003, we immediately reached out to our network of collaborators for further leads. An uncomfortable silence followed over the next few weeks.\nBy mid-January, we noticed the first reports of exported cases in Bangkok and then Tokyo. These reports were surprising, given the low number of reported cases in Wuhan at that point. They motivated us to \u201cnowcast\u201d the true size of the Wuhan outbreak and then forecast the potential for nationwide spread in China during chunyun, the largest annual human migration in the world, which is associated with the Spring Festival.\nFinally, a flurry of WeChat exchanges on January 22, 2020, resulted in our team flying to Beijing the next morning. We spent the next 24 hours working nonstop alongside colleagues from the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention who had already spent 3 weeks frantically collecting and collating data. Our job was to make sense of disparate data sets to tease out the early transmission dynamics of what would subsequently be named Covid-19. Our findings were disseminated in the Journal 6 days later (www.nejm.org/doi/10.1056/NEJMoa2001316\n. opens in new tab\n).\nFigure 1.\nActions Taken to Suppress Covid-19 Transmission in Hong Kong and Occurrence of Laboratory-Confirmed Cases.\nThen, on January 25, the first day of the lunar new year \u2014 the most important holiday in the Chinese calendar \u2014 one of us spent the day huddled with Hong Kong\u2019s entire cabinet.

We led the development of the epidemiology track. Midday on February 11, the first day of the 2-day summit, one of us received a message telling us to immediately return to Hong Kong, then travel on to Beijing for the WHO\u2013China Joint Mission on Covid-19. We spent the next 10 days traversing the country and writing a report that summarized the Chinese experience with Covid-19, with the goal of informing and helping to prepare people throughout the rest of the world.\nAll the while, we were working with colleagues in Boston, in College Park, Maryland, and in Guangzhou to produce evidence to help answer some of the key questions identified in the WHO\u2019s Covid-19 research roadmap, including questions on the disease\u2019s severity and case fatality ratio, the effectiveness of face masks for preventing transmission, and the role of presymptomatic transmission by people incubating the disease, respectively.\nAs scientists conducting research during a pandemic, we are very much public health practitioners at the same time; we therefore never forget our primary responsibility to the local control effort. We produce daily updates on epidemic progress for the public and weekly reports for authorities, aiming to disseminate the most robust and reliable science to inform decision making. The more successful Hong Kong is at keeping a local epidemic at bay, the harder it will be to maintain effective disease-control measures until the first vaccines against Covid-19 arrive. The three-way tug-of-war between health protection, economic preservation, and social acceptance and well-being will remain unresolved until sufficient population immunity is acquired as a result of infection or vaccination.\nSARS brought the three of us together. We matured during the influenza A (H1N1) pandemic in 2009, were further tested by the influenza A (H7N9) avian-to-human outbreak in 2013, and now face Covid-19.

The aim of the present analysis is to investigate the rate of hospital admissions for acute coronary syndrome (ACS) during the early days of the Covid-19 outbreak.\nIn this study, we performed a retrospective analysis of clinical and angiographic characteristics of consecutive patients who were admitted for ACS at 15 hospitals in northern Italy. All the hospitals were hubs of local networks for treatment involving primary percutaneous coronary intervention. The study period was defined as the time between the first confirmed case of Covid-19 in Italy (February 20, 2020) and March 31, 2020. We compared hospitalization rates between the study period and two control periods: a corresponding period during the previous year (February 20 to March 31, 2019) and an earlier period during the same year (January 1 to February 19, 2020). The primary outcome was the overall rate of hospital admissions for ACS. We calculated incidence rates for the primary outcome by dividing the number of cumulative admissions by the number of days for each time period. Incidence rate ratios comparing the study period with each of the control periods were calculated with the use of Poisson regression. (Details regarding the study methods are provided in the Supplementary Appendix, available with the full text of this letter at NEJM.org.)\nTable 1.\nComparison of Hospital Admissions for Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS) in Northern Italy between the Onset of the Covid-19 Outbreak and Two Control Periods.\nOf the 547 patients who were hospitalized for ACS during the study period, 420 (76.8%) were males; the mean (\u00b1SD) age was 68\u00b112 years. Of these patients, 248 (45.3%) presented with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). The mean admission rate for ACS during the study period was 13.3 admissions per day. This rate was significantly lower than either the rate during the earlier period in the same year (total number of admissions, 899; 18.0 admissions per day; incidence rate ratio, 0.74; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.66 to 0.82; P<0.001) or the rate during the previous year (total number of admissions, 756; 18.9 admissions per day; incidence rate ratio, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.63 to 0.78; P<0.001). The incidence rate ratios for individual ACS subtypes are presented in Table 1. After the national lockdown was implemented on March 8, 2020,4 a further reduction in ACS admissions was reported. (Details regarding the full secondary analyses are provided in the Supplementary Appendix.)\nThis report shows a significant decrease in ACS-related hospitalization rates across several cardiovascular centers in northern Italy during the early days of the Covid-19 outbreak. Recent data suggest a significant increase in mortality during this period that was not fully explained by Covid-19 cases alone.5 This observation and data from our study raise the question of whether some patients have died from ACS without seeking medical attention during the Covid-19 pandemic.\nOvidio De Filippo, M.D.\nFabrizio D\u2019Ascenzo, M.D., Ph.D.\nFilippo Angelini, M.D.\nPier Paolo Bocchino, M.D.\nFederico Conrotto, M.D.\nAndrea Saglietto, M.D.\nAzienda Ospedaliera Universitaria Citt\u00e0 della Salute e della Scienza di Torino, Turin, Italy\nfabrizio.dascenzo@unito.it\nGioel Gabrio Secco, M.D.\nAzienda Ospedaliera SS Antonio e Biagio e Cesare Arrigo, Alessandria, Italy\nGianluca Campo, M.D.\nAzienda Ospedaliera Universitaria di Ferrara, Ferrara, Italy\nGuglielmo Gallone, M.D.\nRoberto Verardi, M.D.\nAzienda Ospedaliera Universitaria Citt\u00e0 della Salute e della Scienza di Torino, Turin, Italy\nLuca Gaido, M.D.\nOspedale Maria Vittoria, Turin, Italy\nMario Iannaccone, M.D.\nOspedale San Giovanni Bosco, Turin, Italy\nMarcello Galvani, M.D.\nOspedale Morgagni, Forl\u00ec, Italy\nFabrizio Ugo, M.D.\nPresidio Ospedaliero Sant\u2019Andrea di Vercelli, Vercelli, Italy\nUmberto Barbero, M.D.\nOspedale Civile SS Annunziata, Savigliano, Italy\nVincenzo Infantino, M.D.\nOspedale di Ciri\u00e8, Ciri\u00e8, Italy\nLuca Olivotti, M.D.\nOspedale Santa Corona, Pietra Ligure, Italy\nMarco Mennuni, M.D.\nAzienda Ospedaliera Universitaria Maggiore della Carit\u00e0, Novara, Italy\nSebastiano Gili, M.D.\nIRCCS Centro Cardiologico Monzino, Milan, Italy\nFabio Infusino, M.D.\nSapienza University of Rome, Rome, Italy\nMatteo Vercellino, M.D.\nAzienda Ospedaliera SS Antonio e Biagio e Cesare Arrigo, Alessandria, Italy\nOttavio Zucchetti, M.D.\nAzienda Ospedaliera Universitaria di Ferrara, Ferrara, Italy\nGianni Casella, M.D.\nOspedale Maggiore Carlo Alberto Pizzardi, Bologna, Italy\nMassimo Giammaria, M.D.\nOspedale Maria Vittorial, Turin, Italy\nGiacomo Boccuzzi, M.D.\nOspedale San Giovanni Bosco, Turin, Italy\nPaolo Tolomeo, M.D.\nAzienda Ospedaliera Universitaria di Ferrara, Ferrara, Italy\nBaldassarre Doronzo, M.D.\nOspedale Civile SS Annunziata, Savigliano, Italy\nGaetano Senatore, M.D.\nOspedale di Ciri\u00e8, Ciri\u00e8, Italy\nWalter Grosso Marra, M.D.\nOspedale di Ivrea, Ivrea, Italy\nAndrea Rognoni, M.D.\nAzienda Ospedaliera Universitaria Maggiore della Carit\u00e0, Novara, Italy\nDaniela Trabattoni, M.D.\nIRCCS Centro Cardiologico Monzino, Milan, Italy\nLuca Franchin, M.D.\nAndrea Borin, M.D.\nFrancesco Bruno, M.D.\nAzienda Ospedaliera Universitaria Citt\u00e0 della Salute e della Scienza di Torino, Turin, Italy\nAlessandro Galluzzo, M.D.\nPresidio Ospedaliero Sant\u2019Andrea di Vercelli, Vercelli, Italy\nAlfonso Gambino, M.D.\nOspedale Santa Croce, Moncalieri, Italy\nAnnamaria Nicolino, M.D.\nOspedale Santa Corona, Pietra Ligure, Italy\nAlessandra Truffa Giachet, M.D.\nOspedale Cardinal Massaia, Asti, Italy\nGennaro Sardella, M.D.\nFrancesco Fedele, M.D.\nSapienza University of Rome, Rome, Italy\nSilvia Monticone, M.D., Ph.D.\nUniversity of Torino, Turin, Italy\nAntonio Montefusco, M.D.\nPierluigi Omed\u00e8, M.D.\nMauro Pennone, M.D.\nAzienda Ospedaliera Universitaria Citt\u00e0 della Salute e della Scienza di Torino, Turin, Italy\nGiuseppe Patti, M.D.\nUniversity of Eastern Piedmont, Novara, Italy\nMassimo Mancone, M.D.\nSapienza University of Rome, Rome, Italy\nGaetano M.

The case reports should be viewed as observations rather than as recommendations for evaluation or treatment. In the interest of timeliness, these reports are evaluated by in-house editors, with peer review reserved for key points as needed.\nWe describe a patient with Covid-19 and clinically significant coagulopathy, antiphospholipid antibodies, and multiple infarcts. He was one of three patients with these findings in an intensive care unit designated for patients with Covid-19. This unit, which was managed by a multidisciplinary team from Peking Union Medical College Hospital in the Sino\u2013French New City Branch of Tongji Hospital in Wuhan, China, was set up on an emergency basis to accept the most critically ill patients during the outbreak of Covid-19. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection was confirmed in all the patients by reverse-transcriptase\u2013polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR) assay or serologic testing.\nA 69-year-old man with a history of hypertension, diabetes, and stroke presented with fever, cough, dyspnea, diarrhea, and headache. Covid-19 was diagnosed in the patient on January 25, 2020, on the basis of RT-PCR testing that detected SARS-CoV-2. The initial treatment was supportive; however, the illness subsequently progressed to hypoxemic respiratory failure warranting the initiation of invasive mechanical ventilation.\nTable 1.\nDemographic and Clinical Characteristics and Laboratory Findings.\nOn examination, the patient had evidence of ischemia in the lower limbs bilaterally as well as in digits two and three of the left hand. Computed tomographic imaging of the brain showed bilateral cerebral infarcts in multiple vascular territories. Pertinent laboratory results on admission of the patient (Patient 1) to the intensive care unit are summarized in Table 1. They included leukocytosis, thrombocytopenia, an elevated prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time, and elevated levels of fibrinogen and d-dimer. Subsequent serologic testing showed the presence of anticardiolipin IgA antibodies as well as anti\u2013\u03b22-glycoprotein I IgA and IgG antibodies.\nTwo other patients with similar findings were seen at the specialized intensive care unit for patients with Covid-19 at Tongji Hospital. Serologic tests in these patients were positive for anticardiolipin IgA antibodies as well as anti\u2013\u03b22-glycoprotein I IgA and IgG antibodies. Further clinical details are summarized in Table 1. Lupus anticoagulant was not detected in any of the patients, although testing was performed while the patients were acutely ill.\nAntiphospholipid antibodies abnormally target phospholipid proteins, and the presence of these antibodies is central to the diagnosis of the antiphospholipid syndrome. However, these antibodies can also arise transiently in patients with critical illness and various infections.1 The presence of these antibodies may rarely lead to thrombotic events that are difficult to differentiate from other causes of multifocal thrombosis in critically patients, such as disseminated intravascular coagulation, heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, and thrombotic microangiopathy.\nYan Zhang, M.D.\nMeng Xiao, M.Sc.\nShulan Zhang, M.D.\nPeng Xia, M.D.\nWei Cao, M.D.\nWei Jiang, M.D.\nHuan Chen, M.D.\nXin Ding, M.D.\nHua Zhao, M.D.\nHongmin Zhang, M.D.\nChunyao Wang, M.D.\nJing Zhao, M.D.\nXuefeng Sun, M.D.\nRan Tian, M.D.\nWei Wu, M.D.\nDong Wu, M.D.\nJie Ma, M.D.\nYu Chen, B.S.\nDong Zhang, M.Sc.\nJing Xie, Ph.D.\nXiaowei Yan, M.D.\nXiang Zhou, M.D.\nZhengyin Liu, M.D.\nJinglan Wang, M.D.\nBin Du, M.D.\nYan Qin, M.D.\nPeng Gao, M.D.\nXuzhen Qin, M.D.\nYingchun Xu, M.D.\nWen Zhang, M.D.\nTaisheng Li, M.D.\nFengchun Zhang, M.D.\nYongqiang Zhao, M.D.\nYongzhe Li, M.D.\nShuyang Zhang, M.D.\nPeking Union Medical College Hospital, Beijing, China\nyongzhelipumch@126.com, shuyangzhang103@163.com\nSupported by grants to Dr. Yongzhe Li from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (81671618 and 81871302) and the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences Initiative for Innovative Medicine (2017-I2M-3-001 and 2017-I2M-B&R-01).\nDisclosure forms provided by the authors are available with the full text of this case at NEJM.org.\nThis case was published on April 8, 2020, at NEJM.org.\nDr. Yan Zhang, Mr. Meng Xiao, and Dr. Shulan Zhang and Drs.

Screening for body temperature was conducted at check-in and before boarding, and 3 febrile persons were prevented from boarding (Figure 1); no additional information regarding the status of these 3 febrile persons was available. Surgical masks were provided to passengers on board the plane. On arrival in Singapore, the passengers underwent repeat screening for body temperature (fever was defined as a body temperature \u226538\u00b0C), and 2 persons (a woman 48 years of age [Patient 1] and a woman 47 years of age [Patient 2]) had a fever. The 2 febrile women were transferred immediately to a hospital, and they tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 (their clinical course is described in the Supplementary Appendix, available with the full text of this letter at NEJM.org).\nThe remaining 92 afebrile passengers (age range, 2 to 82 years) were quarantined for 14 days at a government quarantine facility, where they were checked for symptoms and fever three times daily. Six persons reported symptoms (4 on quarantine day 2 and 2 on quarantine day 3) and were placed in isolation in a hospital and underwent polymerase-chain-reaction (PCR) testing; all 6 persons tested negative for SARS-CoV-2. On quarantine day 3, samples from 76 of the 86 asymptomatic persons (75 nasopharyngeal swab samples and 1 nasal swab sample) were obtained and tested by means of PCR assay. A 17-year-old boy (the son of Patient 1) tested positive for Covid-19 and continued to have PCR-positive status for 2 weeks, and a 41-year-old man had an inconclusive result (positive for N gene and negative for ORF1ab gene). On quarantine day 6, samples from all 87 quarantined asymptomatic persons (85 nasopharyngeal swab samples and 2 nasal swab samples [3 of the 6 persons who had been transferred to the hospital before February 2 had returned to the government quarantine facility]) were obtained and tested; all tested negative. All persons who were not isolated in the hospital were released from quarantine on day 14, and all remained uninfected with Covid-19. Understanding the implications of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 infection from persons with asymptomatic or very mild symptomatic cases of Covid-19 is vital for the formulation of containment strategies.\nOon-Tek Ng, M.P.H.\nKalisvar Marimuthu, M.B., B.S.\nPo-Ying Chia, M.B., B.S.\nVanessa Koh, Ph.D.\nNational Centre for Infectious Diseases, Singapore, Singapore\noon_tek_ng@ncid.sg\nkalisvar_marimuthu@ncid.sg\nCalvin J.

A total of 26 recipients (72%) were male, and the median age was 60 years (range, 32 to 77). Fourteen recipients (39%) were black, and 15 recipients (42%) were Hispanic. Twenty-seven recipients (75%) had received a deceased-donor kidney; 34 recipients (94%) had hypertension, 25 (69%) had diabetes mellitus, 13 (36%) had a history of smoking tobacco or were current smokers, and 6 (17%) had heart disease. Thirty-five of the patients (97%) were receiving tacrolimus, 34 (94%) were receiving prednisone, and 31 (86%) were receiving mycophenolate mofetil or mycophenolic acid.\nThe most common initial symptom was fever (in 21 patients [58%]), and diarrhea was observed in 8 patients (22%). Eight patients who were in stable condition without major respiratory symptoms (22%) were monitored at home, and 28 patients (78%) were admitted to the hospital. Twenty-seven of the hospitalized patients (96%) had radiographic findings that were consistent with viral pneumonia, and 11 (39%) received mechanical ventilation. Six patients (21%) received renal replacement therapy. At a median follow-up of 21 days (range, 14 to 28), 10 of the 36 kidney-transplant recipients (28%) and 7 of the 11 patients who were intubated (64%) had died. Two of the 8 patients who were monitored as outpatients died at home; both were recent kidney-transplant recipients who had received antithymocyte globulin within the previous 5 weeks (see the Supplementary Appendix, available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org).\nTable 1.\nClinical Features and Outcomes in the Kidney-Transplant Recipients.\nTable 1 summarizes the initial laboratory results in the 28 hospitalized patients. Twenty-two (79%) were lymphopenic, 12 (43%) had thrombocytopenia, 19 (68%) had low CD3 cell counts, 20 (71%) had low CD4 cell counts, and 8 (29%) had low CD8 cell counts. Inflammatory markers were measured, and 10 patients (36%) had ferritin levels higher than 900 ng per milliliter, 13 (46%) had C-reactive protein levels higher than 5 mg per deciliter, 12 (43%) had procalcitonin levels higher than 0.2 ng per milliliter, and 16 (57%) had d-dimer levels higher than 0.5 \u03bcg per milliliter.\nAlthough effective treatment of Covid-19 is currently unknown,2 immunosuppressive management included withdrawal of an antimetabolite in 24 of 28 patients (86%). In addition, tacrolimus was withheld in 6 of the 28 severely ill patients (21%). Hydroxychloroquine was administered to 24 of these 28 patients (86%). Apixaban was administered to patients with d-dimer levels higher than 3.0 \u03bcg per milliliter. Six severely ill patients received the CCR5 inhibitor leronlimab (PRO 140, CytoDyn) on a compassionate-use basis, and 2 received the interleukin-6 receptor antagonist tocilizumab. Interleukin-6 levels were very elevated (range, 83 to 8175 pg per milliliter) when leronlimab was initiated (on day 0) in the 5 patients with elevated interleukin-6 levels; these levels decreased markedly 3 days later (range, 37 to 2022 pg per milliliter) (see Table S2 in the Supplementary Appendix). However, only the 1 patient who had the lowest interleukin-6 level (at 83 pg per milliliter) remained in stable condition without intubation.\nIn conclusion, at our institution, kidney-transplant recipients with Covid-19 had less fever as an initial symptom,3 lower CD3, CD4, and CD8 cell counts,4 and more rapid clinical progression than persons with Covid-19 in the general population. The number of our patients with very low CD3, CD4, and CD8 cell counts indirectly supports the need to decrease doses of immunosuppressive agents in patients with Covid-19, especially in those who have recently received antithymocyte globulin, which decreases all T-cell subsets for many weeks. Our results show a very high early mortality among kidney-transplant recipients with Covid-19 \u2014 28% at 3 weeks as compared with the reported 1% to 5% mortality among patients with Covid-19 in the general population who have undergone testing in the United States and the reported 8 to 15% mortality among patients with Covid-19 who are older than 70 years of age.\nEnver Akalin, M.D.\nYorg Azzi, M.D.\nRachel Bartash, M.D.\nHarish Seethamraju, M.D.\nMichael Parides, Ph.D.\nVagish Hemmige, M.D.\nMichael Ross, M.D.\nStefanie Forest, M.D., Ph.D.\nYitz D.

Although the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention definition of persons under investigation for Covid-19 has evolved, it generally includes the presence of fever and signs and symptoms of respiratory illness. The first patient with suspected Covid-19 was seen in our emergency department (ED) on February 7, 2020. Since then, we have seen more than 3500 such patients.\nIn order to meet this growing demand, our hospital opened an incident command center. We created a 16-bed \u201cforward triage\u201d and treatment unit for ED patients in our ambulatory care center off site in order to establish a split-flow process to expedite the care of persons under investigation with less acute illness. This space was later needed to further increase the number of hospital beds, and we moved into a field ED tent where we saw more than 100 patients per shift while in full personal protective equipment (PPE), thereby allowing our main ED to function and respond to the needs of critically ill patients. Use of the field tent has required a structured and efficient approach, including front-door ED screening to direct patients to the tent, nurse-led triage, and evaluation of each patient by both a midlevel practitioner and an attending physician.\nThe most common symptoms we see include cough, fever, shortness of breath, myalgia, fatigue, and diarrhea. Contact with sick people (including those with Covid-19) has been reported by nearly half of patients. Of more than 2000 chest x-rays, half have shown opacities, in most cases in both lungs. Many patients are not tachypneic or hypoxic and are discharged; less than 5% have returned within several days after discharge.\nTo increase much-needed staff, physicians and nurses \u2014 including retired clinicians \u2014 have been rapidly retrained and reassigned according to need. Surgeons, dermatologists, and psychiatrists (as well as many other specialists) are caring for patients normally cared for by medical hospitalists and intensivists. Personnel from other hospitals are being added as needed (www.localsyr.com/health/coronavirus/suny-upstate-sends-nursing-staff-to-assist-stony-brook-hospital/\n. opens in new tab\n). We have also used social networks to learn from other providers in our area and throughout the world while sharing our own experience.\nIn order to be informed by our own data, we established a hospital-wide registry of persons under investigation for Covid-19. We learned that most (70%) of these patients who are seen in the ED can be sent home. Of the 30% of patients who are admitted, approximately 10% require immediate intensive care or mechanical ventilation, and another 15% require these scarce resources within approximately 2 days after admission. This information has helped us predict how many patients will require intensive care and ventilation at any given time, thus providing a window for us to prepare and proactively intervene. To minimize direct contact with patients and to conserve PPE, we rapidly deployed a telehealth solution that involves giving patients iPads to communicate with health care staff and consultants. Our engineers and chemists have been producing face shields, masks, a prototype ventilator, and hand sanitizer (https://news.stonybrook.edu/sb_medicine/stony-brook-ingenuity-takes-on-coronavirus/\n. opens in new tab\n). We have found a safe and effective way to sterilize used N95 respirators to further conserve PPE (www.battelle.org/newsroom/news-details/battelle-cleared-to-sterilize-n95-masks-at-max-capacity-operate-in-other-states-to-fight-coronavirus-ppe-shortage\n. opens in new tab\n). Our engineering and information-technology staff have greatly expanded our numbers of beds and negative-pressure rooms, intensive care unit capacity, and telehealth capabilities, which has been critical in handling the surge.\nFor clinicians in areas that have not yet been hard hit, the pandemic wave will surely come. Persons under investigation for Covid-19 should be treated as if they are infected. These patients often have a progression of disease severity, with approximately 15% of admitted patients requiring upgrades in care. We hope that lessons from our center will help prepare other physicians and hospitals for what is likely to come so they can stay ahead of the wave.\nAdam J. Singer, M.D.\nEric J.

Trials to assess the efficacy of antirheumatic therapies such as hydroxychloroquine1 and anticytokine therapies such as interleukin-6 inhibitors2 to improve outcomes in patients with Covid-19 are ongoing. The rationale for their use is that worse outcomes (i.e., hospitalization, ventilation, or death) may be related to a proinflammatory cytokine storm.3,4\nHere, we report a prospective case series involving patients with known immune-mediated inflammatory disease (rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, psoriasis, inflammatory bowel disease, or related conditions) who were receiving anticytokine biologics, other immunomodulatory therapies, or both when confirmed or highly suspected symptomatic Covid-19 developed. Established patients at New York University Langone Health in New York City who had immune-mediated inflammatory disease were assessed during the period from March 3 through April 3, 2020 (average follow-up, 16 days from symptom onset). We analyzed the demographic and clinical data on patients who had immune-mediated inflammatory disease with symptomatic Covid-19 and compared the patients for whom hospitalization was warranted (hospitalized patients) with those for whom it was not (ambulatory patients).\nTable 1.\nBaseline Characteristics of the Patients in Whom Covid-19 Was Confirmed or Highly Suspected.\nWe identified 86 patients with immune-mediated inflammatory disease who had either confirmed (59 patients) or highly suspected (27 patients) symptomatic Covid-19 infection (Table 1, and Table S1 in the Supplementary Appendix, available with the full text of this letter at NEJM.org). Of these patients, 62 of 86 (72%) were receiving biologics or Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors, and the overall incidence of hospitalization was 16% (14 of 86 patients). The hospitalized patients were older than the ambulatory patients. Although the distribution of diagnoses of immune-mediated inflammatory diseases was similar in the ambulatory group and the hospitalized group, a higher percentage of admitted patients had rheumatoid arthritis. As compared with the ambulatory patients, more of the patients for whom hospitalization was warranted had coexisting hypertension, diabetes, or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.\nThe percentage of patients who were receiving biologics or JAK inhibitors at baseline was higher among the ambulatory patients than among the hospitalized patients (55 of 72 patients [76%] and 7 of 14 patients [50%], respectively) (Table 1 and Table S2), and the overall incidence of hospitalization among patients who had received these medications on a long-term basis was 11% (7 of 62 patients). However, even after multivariate analysis, the use of oral glucocorticoids (in 4 of 14 hospitalized patients [29%] and in 4 of 72 ambulatory patients [6%]), hydroxychloroquine (in 3 of 14 patients [21%] and 5 of 72 patients [7%], respectively), and methotrexate (in 6 of 14 patients [43%] and 11 of 72 patients [15%], respectively) was higher among patients with immune-mediated inflammatory disease for whom hospitalization was warranted (Table S2). These observations were consistent when the analysis was restricted to patients with confirmed SARS-Cov-2 infection on polymerase-chain-reaction testing (Table S3).\nOf the 14 patients with immune-mediated inflammatory disease who were hospitalized, 79% (11 of 14) were discharged (mean stay, 5.6 days), and 2 remain hospitalized as of April 3. Of the 2 patients with more severe disease, 1 had elevated interleukin-6 levels and received mechanical ventilation for acute respiratory distress syndrome, and the other died in the emergency department; neither patient was receiving biologic therapies on a long-term basis (Table S4). Additional data are provided in Tables S5 through S8.\nA better understanding of the implications of Covid-19 in patients with immune-mediated inflammatory disease and the effects of anticytokine and other immunosuppressive therapies is urgently needed to guide clinicians in the care of patients with psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, and related conditions. Although our analysis was limited in sample size, our data reveal an incidence of hospitalization among patients with immune-mediated inflammatory disease that was consistent with that among patients with Covid-19 in the general population in New York City reported by the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene5 (35,746 of 134,874 patients [26%]) (Table S5). These findings suggest that the baseline use of biologics is not associated with worse Covid-19 outcomes.\nRebecca Haberman, M.D.\nJordan Axelrad, M.D., M.P.H.\nNew York University Langone Health, New York, NY\nAlan Chen, M.S.\nNew York University Grossman School of Medicine, New York, NY\nRochelle Castillo, M.D.\nDi Yan, M.D.\nPeter Izmirly, M.D.\nAndrea Neimann, M.D.\nNew York University Langone Health, New York, NY\nSamrachana Adhikari, Ph.D.\nNew York University Grossman School of Medicine, New York, NY\nDavid Hudesman, M.D.\nJose U.

The rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2, combined with an unprecedented, near-complete global lockdown, has laid bare the weaknesses in health systems. Lack of adequate health care infrastructure and human resources, serious supply-chain disruptions, and widespread fear among patients and health care workers have resulted in patient care and safety being compromised. Throughout the world, health systems have had to scramble together rapidly changing responses while relying on inadequate information and on models of disease spread that are based on multiple assumptions. The resulting rationing of care has left patients and physicians feeling frustrated and burned out. Several cancer centers drastically scaled back their services after preliminary reports from China showed that Covid-19 outcomes are significantly worse among patients with cancer.\nTable 1.\nSummary of Covid-19 Measures Taken at Tata Memorial Centre.\nAt Tata Memorial Centre (India\u2019s largest cancer center), despite having to scale back operations by about one third, we made the decision to continue providing cancer care using a proactive and multipronged approach (www.indianjcancer.com/preprintarticle.asp?id=281968\n. opens in new tab\n), the components of which are summarized in Table 1. Some degree of scaling back was required to allow for physical distancing in clinics and because India\u2019s lockdown prevented some patients and health care workers from being able to reach the hospital. We also established a staff-sparing strategy, which involved providing paid leave for at-risk employees and rotating remaining staff.\nOur de-escalation of services has been far less pronounced than the cuts made at similar cancer facilities globally. The decision not to cut routine services was based on two factors. First, because the government took early decisive action, SARS-CoV-2 has spread more slowly in India than in some other countries, and we are not yet seeing large numbers of hospitalizations for Covid-19 in Mumbai. More important, for a center that sees more than 70,000 new patients with cancer each year, even a slowdown in clinical services is likely to have a substantial impact on outcomes. Although cancer is often not immediately life threatening, treatment services are also not entirely elective, and delaying care can have serious adverse consequences.\nThe constraints created by the pandemic have required us to make some difficult choices, including those we made in drawing up prioritization criteria to guide treatment decisions. Patients with potentially curable disease who could substantially benefit from treatment are given high priority, whereas care for patients who were being treated with palliative intent, especially those for whom interventions are expected to have marginal benefit, is being deferred. Decisions about care for individual patients are made by balancing the risk that patients will contract Covid-19 because of exposures associated with cancer treatment \u2014 and their risk for complications if they do \u2014 with the benefits of receiving potentially lifesaving cancer treatment.\nWe have already learned a great deal from this pandemic. Being forced to quickly respond led to a radical overhauling of entrenched hospital systems and processes, which ultimately made our operations more efficient. The rapidly evolving nature of the pandemic meant that we needed the full and unconditional support of our large body of employees. We gained this support by establishing open electronic-communication channels and a process for shared decision making, despite circumstances that preclude face-to-face meetings. We were quick to share best practices and guidelines for cancer treatment during the pandemic with other hospitals in India by creating a series of webinars available through the National Cancer Grid, a network of cancer centers that includes our hospital (https://ncgeducation.in/course/view.php?id=37\n. opens in new tab\n).\nThe decisions we had to make regarding triaging of patients for cancer treatment will undoubtedly be helpful when we establish a robust health technology assessment program, an essential tool in a country where public health care expenditures are low. Our previous work on the \u201cChoosing Wisely India\u201d campaign to outline low-value or harmful practices in cancer care (https://www.thelancet.com/article/S1470-2045(19)30092-0/fulltext\n. opens in new tab\n) also facilitated our Covid-19 response. Countries that have not had high rates of death from Covid-19 could consider similar approaches that involve balancing pandemic control with providing continued cancer care.\nC.S.

(published March 17 at NEJM.org)1 provides important information on the viability of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19), and the implication that the virus remains viable in aerosols is likely to influence infection-control practices. The authors used a three-jet Collison nebulizer to generate artificial particles that, because of their small size (<5 \u03bcm), remained suspended in aerosols. However, the authors did not provide data to support the choice of particle size or viral inoculum.\nA closely related coronavirus, SARS-CoV-1, was not detected in air samples obtained from the rooms of patients with SARS-CoV-1 infection2,3 and, when detected by means of polymerase-chain-reaction assays, it was determined not to be viable in Vero E6 cell cultures.3 Similarly, recent, albeit small, studies show that despite extensive environmental contamination, SARS-CoV-2 is not present in air samples obtained from the rooms of hospitalized patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19),4 and it is not transmitted to exposed health care workers who are wearing surgical masks during aerosol-generating procedures.5 The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends the implementation of droplet and contact precautions by health care workers when they care for SARS-CoV-2\u2013infected patients who are not undergoing aerosol-generating procedures. Further studies are warranted to investigate the extent of aerosol transmission of SARS-CoV-2, since this has important implications for infection-control practices in the care of hospitalized patients.\nJessica H.

We would like to provide clarification regarding the implications of their findings for infection prevention and control.\nSome persons have incorrectly interpreted these findings as evidence of airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2. This experiment did not replicate a human cough.1 It was limited to small particles (<5 \u03bcm) and did not capture the broad distribution of typically much larger particles that are generated from coughing.2 The experiment does provide theoretical evidence that SARS-CoV-2 could survive as droplet nuclei after an aerosol-generating medical procedure. However, surgical masks may be as protective against Covid-19 as N95 respirators.3 The institution of airborne precautions for aerosol-generating medical procedures is a reasonable approach, given that fresh aerosols may contain viable virus. Current evidence provides support for direct contact and respiratory droplets as the predominant routes of transmission.4\nThis study highlights the importance of environmental cleaning and meticulous hand hygiene. However, it does not indicate that airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2 occurs.\nKevin L.

The findings in the letter by van Doremalen et al. must be interpreted cautiously. Their experimental conditions may not be generalizable to exposures that health care workers typically encounter.\nWith an average room volume of 25,000 liters, human tidal volumes of 400 to 1000 liters per hour, and an estimated exhaled viral concentration of 103 TCID50 (50% tissue-culture infectious dose) per liter from an infected patient, an unmasked health care worker would inhale approximately 900 infectious viral units in 15 minutes, if dilutional effects are taken into account. However, this calculation assumes that patients generate aerosols equivalent to those of the highly efficient three-jet Collison nebulizer, that there are no room air exchanges, and that surgical masks have no efficacy.\nIn an anecdotal case report, 35 health care workers who were wearing surgical masks and caring for a severely ill patient were not infected, even though they were performing aerosol-generating procedures.1 Surgical masks are not inferior to N95 respirators in preventing influenza infections in health care workers.2,3 Data from experimental and epidemiologic studies to determine the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 to health care workers are lacking.4\nEmil Lesho, D.O.\nMaryrose Laguio-Vila, M.D.\nRochester Regional Health, Rochester, NY\ncarolinelesho@yahoo.com\nEdward Walsh, M.D.\nUniversity of Rochester School of Medicine and Dentistry, Rochester, NY\nNo potential conflict of interest relevant to this letter was reported.\nThis letter was published on April 13, 2020, at NEJM.org.\n4 References\nTO THE EDITOR\nI have noted a troubling misinterpretation by media outlets of some of the findings of the experiments by van Doremalen et al. regarding the viability of SARS-CoV-2 on various materials and in aerosols. This study does not change the practice of most hospitals in caring for or preparing to care for patients with Covid-19. Rather, it provides support for a continued mandate for effective surface cleaning and hand hygiene.\nThe applicability of the aerosol experiments in this study to clinical practice is limited. The authors studied the survivability of aerosolized virus during an experiment in which they maintained the aerosols for a prolonged period in a Goldberg drum at 65% relative humidity. Noninvasive ventilation circuits have a relative humidity of 100% at expiration, and the relative humidity in the patient rooms in my hospital is closer to 30% than 65%. The aerosols that humans generate have a limited dispersion and are not maintained artificially for hours. On the basis of encouraging data from Hong Kong,1 for the time being, my colleagues and I will continue to use N95 respirator masks only during those procedures such as intubation and with therapies such as noninvasive ventilation that artificially generate aerosols.\nAndrew Helmers, M.D.\nHospital for Sick Children, Toronto, ON, Canada\nandrew.helmers@sickkids.ca\nNo potential conflict of interest relevant to this letter was reported.\nThis letter was published on April 13, 2020, at NEJM.org.\n1 Reference\nTO THE EDITOR\nThe letter by van Doremalen and colleagues reporting that aerosol transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is plausible has been criticized.1 In a situation report, the WHO maintained that there is available evidence that SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted during close contact through respiratory droplets and by fomites, whereas airborne transmission is limited to aerosol-generating procedures in the clinical care of patients with Covid-19.1 The WHO report included eight references to corroborate this statement. However, the cited studies and reports did not rule out the hypothesis of airborne transmission. Indeed, seven epidemiologic investigations cited in the report showed intrafamilial and community transmissions, and up to 73% of the patients with Covid-19 in one analysis2 reported having had no contact with a person with respiratory symptoms or exposure to relevant contaminated areas. Another analysis involving patients in airborne-infection isolation rooms3 showed that air outlet fans, located high on the wall behind the bed of one patient, were contaminated with SARS-CoV-2; this suggests that virus-laden aerosols, produced by the isolated patient, were displaced by airflow and deposited on the vents. These analyses and the letter by van Doremalen et al. suggest that airborne transmission cannot be categorically ruled out as an important route of community transmission of SARS-CoV-2.\nStefano Petti, Ph.D.\nSapienza University of Rome, Rome, Italy\nstefano.petti@uniroma1.it\nNo potential conflict of interest relevant to this letter was reported.\nThis letter was published on April 13, 2020, at NEJM.org.\n3 References\nRESPONSE\nThe authors and a colleague reply: As the pandemic of Covid-19 continues to grow, health care workers are facing shortages of PPE and hospitals are continuing to adapt protocols to balance the safety of health care workers with patient care. There have been numerous questions about our recent study on the surface stability of SARS-CoV-2, particularly regarding the implications of our findings for prevention of nosocomial transmission and infection. The WHO has recommended droplet and contact precautions (i.e., a surgical mask with eye protection, a gown, and gloves) for health care workers who are caring for patients with confirmed or suspected Covid-19.1 Meanwhile, airborne and contact precautions (which upgrade from a surgical mask to a respirator such as an N95 respirator or a powered air-purifying respirator) are reserved for health care workers who are performing aerosol-generating medical procedures.1\nThe authors of the letters about our study correctly acknowledge that the viability of SARS-CoV-2 in aerosols was investigated under experimental conditions and should not be used to draw conclusions about airborne transmission. What can be interpreted from the study is that when SARS-CoV-2 is aerosolized, its stability is similar to that of SARS-CoV-1. This finding is important in the context of medical procedures that can either mechanically generate infectious pathogen-laden aerosols or cause patients to generate them.2 Aerosol-generating medical procedures have been associated with nosocomial transmission of emerging viruses, including SARS-CoV-1 and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV).2 Currently, there are insufficient data regarding aerosol-generating medical procedures and SARS-CoV-2. However, data indicate that health care workers who work in settings where such procedures are performed may have an increased risk of Covid-19.3\nGiven that the stability of SARS-CoV-2 is similar to that of SARS-CoV-1, previous studies of SARS-CoV-1 and aerosol-generating medical procedures should be examined to infer possible risks associated with SARS-CoV-2.4 It is also important to recognize the wide range of activities that involve aerosol-generating medical procedures \u2014 such as cardiopulmonary resuscitation \u2014 but are often not considered.2 As PPE is depleted, it will be important to know which aerosol-generating medical procedures pose the greatest risks to health care workers. These procedures could then be risk-stratified to ensure that sufficient PPE is available for the most high-risk situations. This will require both experimental studies to understand the characteristics of aerosols generated during medical procedures as well as on-site sampling to detect SARS-CoV-2 in clinical settings.2\nFinally, there is an urgent need to evaluate decontamination techniques that would allow the reuse of crucial PPE such as respirators for aerosol-generating medical procedures. Our group and other groups are studying these techniques. Ultimately, vigilance, especially among health care workers, is needed to prevent nosocomial transmission of SARS-CoV-2.\nSeth D.

In one study group, persons enrolled online and were sent kits, by rapid-delivery services, for home collection of a midnasal swab; samples were returned by mail. After identification of the first case of Covid-19 in Washington State, the samples that were collected were also tested for SARS-CoV-2. After March 4, 2020, a human subjects institutional review board determined that results could be reported to public health authorities and to participants, who were notified under a public health surveillance exemption.\nFigure 1.\nCovid-19 Case Detection through the Seattle Flu Study.\nFrom January 1 through March 9, 2020, a total of 3524 participants provided specimens after online enrollment. Of these, 2353 (66.8%) completed all the study procedures, including testing; SARS-CoV-2 was detected in 25 (1.1%), of whom 2 were children (Figure 1A). Enrollment increased markedly in late February, most likely motivated by public concern about Covid-19 (Figure 1A). Some of the collection kits (1316 of 2353 [55.9%]) were sent to participants for same-day delivery, with a median delivery time of 2.3 hours (interquartile range, 1.7 to 3.1). The median number of days from swab collection to receipt of the specimen by the laboratory was 2 days (interquartile range, 2 to 4). Semiquantitative viral loads from home-collected midnasal swabs were stable over time for SARS-CoV-2, other respiratory viruses, and RNase P, a human cellular marker (Figure 1B).\nIn this early phase of the pandemic, only 7 of the 25 persons with Covid-19 (28%) reported seeking clinical care. The most common reported symptoms were fatigue, myalgia, fever, cough, and chills. The median duration of symptoms before swab collection was 4 days; 9 participants (36%) had had symptoms for less than 2 days at time of swab collection. Coinfection with another respiratory virus was present in 4 cases (16%).\nThe first Covid-19 case detected through the Seattle Flu Study, in a specimen collected on February 24, 2020, was the first documented U.S. case of community transmission at the time.3 These results initiated assessment of the spread of the virus in the Seattle region, which in turn accelerated public health efforts to mitigate the emerging pandemic.4 As the Covid-19 pandemic progresses, widespread implementation of simple methods that are scalable and require minimal interaction for collection of samples from persons who may not seek clinical care is critical for early detection of community cases. Looking beyond the current crisis, we envision ubiquitous, community-based sampling for respiratory illnesses as essential infrastructure for early detection and mitigation of future pandemics.\nHelen Y.

The case reports should be viewed as observations rather than as recommendations for evaluation or treatment. In the interest of timeliness, these reports are evaluated by in-house editors, with peer review reserved for key points as needed.\nA 65-year-old woman with hypertension, autoimmune hypothyroidism, and known Covid-19 exposure presented to the emergency department with a 4-day history of fatigue, fever, dry cough, and abdominal discomfort. She was afebrile and had a respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute and an oxygen saturation of 89% while she was breathing ambient air; breath sounds were diminished bilaterally with bibasilar rales. The abdominal examination was normal.\nLaboratory tests showed a normal white-cell count, hemoglobin level (14.2 g per deciliter), and platelet count (183,000 per cubic millimeter). The C-reactive protein level was elevated at 55 mg per liter, and liver-function tests showed cholestasis. An oropharyngeal swab for Covid-19 testing was positive. Chest computed tomography (CT) showed ground-glass opacities in the lower zones.\nFigure 1.\nPurpuric Lesions on the Patient\u2019s Lower Extremity.\nThe patient was admitted and began to receive treatment with intravenous amoxicillin\u2013clavulanic acid, low-molecular-weight heparin, and oxygen. On day 4, lower-extremity purpura (Figure 1) appeared and epistaxis occurred. Isolated thrombocytopenia (platelet count, 66,000 per cubic millimeter) was noted; these findings prompted discontinuation of heparin and antibiotics. On day 5, the platelet count was 16,000 per cubic millimeter, and on day 7, it was 8000 per cubic millimeter.\nThe prothrombin and activated partial thromboplastin times were normal; the fibrinogen level was 5 g per liter (normal range, 2 to 4). A peripheral-blood smear showed less than 1% schistocytes. The level of thyroid peroxidase antibodies was 245 U per milliliter (normal value, <35); antiplatelet factor 4, antiplatelet antibodies, and antinuclear antibodies were not detected.\nIntravenous immune globulin was administered at a rate of 1 g per kilogram of body weight. After 48 hours, the platelet count decreased to 1000 per cubic millimeter and the purpuric lesions progressed; this prompted a second infusion of immune globulin at a dose of 1 g per kilogram.1,2\nBone marrow aspiration showed normal cellularity with an increase in pleomorphic megakaryocytes. Erythroblast and granulocyte cell lines were normal, without evidence of hemophagocytosis.\nOn day 9, a right frontal headache developed in the patient, without fever, vomiting, or focal neurologic deficit. CT of the head showed a subarachnoid microhemorrhage in the right frontal lobe. The platelet count was 2000 per cubic millimeter, and a platelet transfusion was administered with 100 mg of prednisolone; eltrombopag (75 mg per day) was initiated.1,2\nOn day 10, the headache had resolved, there were no new neurologic findings, and the platelet count had increased to 10,000 per cubic millimeter. All the other laboratory tests had normalized except for the fibrinogen level, which remained elevated (3.5 g per liter). On day 13, the platelet count was 139,000 per cubic millimeter, and the purpura had disappeared.\nThe temporal sequence in this case suggests,3 but does not prove, that Covid-19 was a causal factor in immune thrombocytopenia in this patient. Fortunately, she had a response to treatment, albeit in a delayed fashion.

In late March, demand for intensive care unit (ICU) beds and mechanical ventilation exceeded baseline capacity at New York\u2013Presbyterian Weill Cornell Medical Center. At the same time, many of our operating rooms (ORs) and postanesthesia care units (PACUs) were not in use because elective procedures had been postponed.\nTo increase our critical care capacity, we rapidly converted ORs and PACUs to ICUs wherever feasible. This process involved repurposing every available anesthesia machine, given the shortage of traditional ventilators. As a result of these efforts, we were able to configure an additional 60 beds for critically ill ventilator-dependent patients, thereby increasing our hospital\u2019s critical care capacity by 52% from baseline. The first beds were ready for use within 3 days after we initiated this process.\nWe selected ORs and PACUs best suited for conversion to ICUs on the basis of their size, location, and available infrastructure, while preserving some ORs for emergency surgeries. The capacity of pressurized medical gas lines and power supplies were limiting factors. In one perioperative area, for example, the power infrastructure was not sufficient to reliably run all the necessary critical care equipment.\nTo reduce exposure risks for staff and conserve personal protective equipment (PPE), we converted ORs to negative-pressure environments by reversing the airflow in certain ventilation systems and installing high-efficiency particulate air filters over former exhaust vents. In PACUs, where \u201copen\u201d beds surrounded a central nursing station, we built walls to create distinct negative-pressure areas for groups of two to six individually ventilated patients and installed plexiglass windows to allow clinicians to maintain a direct view of patients. We reconfigured data ports to connect anesthesia machines to central monitors in all the new nursing stations. Although most OR equipment was cleared and stored, we repurposed some items (such as suction canisters, mayo stands, and storage carts) to serve critical care needs, and we used our institution\u2019s existing medical ICU inventory lists to fill shelves and medication-dispensing systems with the necessary supplies and medications. These changes required rapid work by pharmacists, facilities staff, biomedical engineers, information-technology teams, and countless others.\nIn most of our new \u201cOR-ICUs,\u201d a clean-core area serves as both a workspace and a place to store supplies. Providers don PPE in this area before entering an OR-ICU to care for a patient. Later, they doff their PPE and exit through the main OR doors, where scrub sinks for performing hand hygiene are located. In the PACU-ICUs, clinician workflows are similar to those used in standard ICUs.\nWe have not been immune to staffing shortages. We retrained all available perioperative staff and redeployed them to these newly configured areas, and we have adapted staffing ratios to optimize care, imitating our current ICU models when possible. Certified registered nurse anesthetists, who are familiar with anesthesia machines, now serve as respiratory therapists, and anesthesia intensivists supervise these units.\nThis transformation of ORs and PACUs to ICUs has allowed us to support the needs of our surrounding community while also permitting an influx of patients from other hospitals in New York City that were operating over capacity. For hospitals anticipating surges of patients with Covid-19, clear plans for expanding critical care capacity are essential and must include multidisciplinary support.

Lupus anticoagulant can affect in vitro tests of blood coagulation but typically is not associated with bleeding. As part of the antiphospholipid syndrome, lupus anticoagulant is associated with a thrombotic risk. We investigated the cause of prolonged aPTT in patients with Covid-19.\nBlood specimens obtained from 216 patients who were positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) were received for coagulation screening, and 44 (20%) were found to have a prolonged aPTT. The specimens from 9 patients were excluded, and those from 35 patients were investigated further. (Details of the methods are provided in the Supplementary Appendix, available with the full text of this letter at NEJM.org.)\nTable 1.\nDemographic and Clinical Characteristics and Laboratory Findings in 35 Patients with Covid-19 and a Prolonged aPTT.\nA summary of the results is provided in Table 1. The median age was 57 years, and 24 patients were male. Pulmonary embolism was confirmed in 1 patient, and clinically suspected thrombosis was present in 1 patient. No clinically significant bleeding or arterial thromboses were reported.\nNo patients were found to have deficiencies in factor VIII or factor IX. In 5 patients, marginal reductions in factor XI were found that were unlikely to be of clinical significance. The factor XII level was 50 IU per deciliter or lower in 16 patients. Lupus anticoagulant assays were performed in 34 patients, and 31 (91%) were positive. The presence of lupus anticoagulant was indicated by two assays (dilute Russell\u2019s viper-venom time [DRVVT] and lupus anticoagulant\u2013sensitive aPTT) in 18 of 34 patients (53%), by DRVVT alone in 7 (21%), and by lupus anticoagulant\u2013sensitive aPTT alone in 6 (18%). All lupus anticoagulant\u2013positive specimens had a prolonged aPTT with a 50:50 mix (i.e., in a sample made up of 50% patient plasma and 50% normal plasma).\nIn a historical control cohort of 540 specimens received for lupus anticoagulant testing, 43 (8%) had an aPTT of 30 seconds or longer, and 11 of the 43 (26%) were positive for lupus anticoagulant. The percentage of specimens that were positive for lupus anticoagulant was significantly higher among the patients with Covid-19 than in the control cohort (P<0.001) (see the Supplementary Appendix).\nIn our study, most patients with Covid-19 who were admitted to the hospital with a prolonged aPTT were positive for lupus anticoagulant (91%) and often had an associated factor XII deficiency. It is important to note that neither observation is associated with a bleeding tendency; factor XII is not required for hemostasis, and the presence of lupus anticoagulant, if persistent, can be associated with a thrombotic tendency within the antiphospholipid syndrome. Further study is required to determine the role, if any, of lupus anticoagulant in the pathogenesis of Covid-19 thrombosis.\nAlthough we detected heparin in 28 of the 35 specimens, the DRVVT assay contains heparinase, which neutralizes any heparin effect that might lead to false positive detection of lupus anticoagulant. An association between lupus anticoagulants and acquired factor XII deficiency secondary to factor XII antibodies has been described previously. It is notable that the aPTT prolongation in the patients in our study was present despite substantial elevations in factor VIII, which shortens the aPTT.\nWe suggest that a prolonged aPTT should not be a barrier to the use of anticoagulation therapies in the prevention and treatment of venous thrombosis in patients with Covid-19. In our opinion, clinicians should not withhold use of anticoagulants for thrombosis while awaiting further investigation of a prolonged aPTT, nor should they withhold thrombolytic therapy in the face of a high-risk pulmonary embolism on the basis of a prolonged aPTT alone.\nLouise Bowles, M.B., B.S.\nSean Platton, M.Sc.\nNada Yartey, M.Sc.\nMinal Dave, M.Sc.\nKurtis Lee, M.Sc.\nDaniel P.

By March 25, Italy had the second highest number of Covid-19 infections worldwide and the greatest number of deaths.1 Children younger than 18 years of age who had Covid-19 composed only 1% of the total number of patients; 11% of these children were hospitalized, and none died.2 The Coronavirus Infection in Pediatric Emergency Departments (CONFIDENCE) study involved a cohort of 100 Italian children younger than 18 years of age with Covid-19 confirmed by reverse-transcriptase\u2013polymerase-chain-reaction testing of nasal or nasopharyngeal swabs who were assessed between March 3 and March 27 in 17 pediatric emergency departments. Here, we describe the results of the CONFIDENCE study and compare them with those from three cohorts in previously published analyses.3-5\nTable 1.\nEpidemiologic Characteristics, Clinical Features, and Outcomes in the Italian CONFIDENCE Cohort as Compared with Other Cohorts.\nThe median age of the children was 3.3 years (Table 1). Exposure to SARS-CoV-2 from an unknown source or from a source outside the child\u2019s family accounted for 55% of the cases of infection. A total of 12% of the children appeared ill, and 54% had a temperature of at least 37.6\u00b0C. Common symptoms were cough (in 44% of the patients) and no feeding or difficulty feeding (in 23%); the latter symptom occurred more often in children younger than 21 months of age. Fever, cough, or shortness of breath occurred in 28 of 54 of febrile patients (52%) (Table S1 in the Supplementary Appendix, available with the full text of this letter at NEJM.org). A total of 4% of the children had oxygen saturation values (as measured by pulse oximetry) of less than 95%; all these patients also had imaging evidence of lung involvement. Of the 9 patients who received respiratory support (Table S2), 6 had coexisting conditions. Laboratory and imaging findings are provided in Tables S3 and S4.\nAccording to the categories described by Dong et al.,4 21% of the patients were asymptomatic, 58% had mild disease, 19% had moderate disease, 1% had severe disease, and 1% were in critical condition (Table S5). Most of the infants presented with mild disease. Severe and critical cases were diagnosed in patients with coexisting conditions. No deaths were reported. A total of 38% of the patients were admitted to the hospital because of symptoms, irrespective of the severity of disease (Table 1).4\nAmong our patients, the incidence of transmission through apparent exposure to a family cluster was lower than that in other cohorts, possibly because of the late lockdown in Italy. As compared with the other cohorts, fewer patients in our cohort had moderate-to-severe disease, possibly because chest radiography was predominantly used and chest computed tomography was rarely used. Thus, fewer cases of diagnosed (subclinical) pneumonia may have been identified. Bedside lung ultrasonography by experienced sonographers was performed in only 10% of the patients, 90% of whom received a diagnosis of lung interstitial syndrome without further radiographic imaging.\nNiccol\u00f2 Parri, M.D.\nMatteo Lenge, Ph.D.\nMeyer University Children\u2019s Hospital, Florence, Italy\nniccolo.parri@meyer.it\nDanilo Buonsenso, M.D.\nFondazione Policlinico Universitario A.

The case reports should be viewed as observations rather than as recommendations for evaluation or treatment. In the interest of timeliness, these reports are evaluated by in-house editors, with peer review reserved for key points as needed.\nA 3-week-old boy presented with a 2-day history of nasal congestion, tachypnea, and reduced feeding. He was born at 36 weeks of gestation to a 21-year-old woman (gravida 3, para 1) who had received antenatal treatment for carriage of group B streptococci. He had previously received a 48-hour course of antibiotics for suspected neonatal sepsis because of a fever (temperature, 38.5\u00b0C), but the workup for sepsis was negative, and he was discharged home.\nFigure 1.\nChest Radiographs.\nOn admission of the patient to the emergency department, the temperature was 36.1\u00b0C, the pulse 166 beats per minute, the blood pressure 89/63 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 40 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 87% while the patient was breathing ambient air. Chest radiography showed bilateral linear opacities and consolidation in the right upper lobe (Figure 1A). Oxygen and empirical antibiotics (ampicillin and gentamicin) were administered, and the patient was transferred to a pediatric hospital.\nOn transfer, the patient had hypotension, tachycardia, hypothermia, and tachypnea. Droplet and contact precautions were initiated, and he was transferred to a negative-pressure room in the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU), where he was intubated and received crystalloid solution at a dose of 60 ml per kilogram of body weight, followed by vasopressors. Nasal swabs were obtained for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) testing and a respiratory viral panel. Chest radiography performed after intubation showed bilateral infiltrates and partial collapse of the right upper lobe (Figure 1B). Transthoracic echocardiography showed normal cardiac anatomy and function. The white-cell count was 4000 per cubic millimeter with 55% lymphocytes; levels of inflammatory markers were elevated (full laboratory results are provided in the Supplementary Appendix, available with the full text of this case at NEJM.org).\nMechanical ventilation was initiated with a positive end-expiratory pressure of 7 cm of water, a fraction of inspired oxygen of 0.6, and a mean airway pressure of 22 cm of water, resulting in a partial pressure of arterial oxygen of 49 mm Hg and a partial pressure of arterial carbon dioxide of 80 mm Hg. Treatment was switched to vancomycin, cefepime, and ampicillin and was discontinued after 48 hours when the cultures were negative. Hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin were initiated for presumed Covid-19.\nOn day 2 after admission, the hypotension resolved. A pneumothorax that developed on the right side (Figure 1C) was successfully treated by tube thoracostomy. The patient was extubated on day 5 and was transferred out of the PICU. The results of reverse-transcriptase\u2013polymerase-chain-reaction testing to detect SARS-CoV-2 on admission were positive on day 7; he completed the 5-day course of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin. The patient was discharged on day 9 without supplemental oxygen. One of eight household contacts of the patient, a 49-year-old woman, was symptomatic; however, none of the contacts were tested for SARS-CoV-2.\nAlthough children are less likely than adults to have severe Covid-19, this case illustrates that it can occur and can be successfully managed with standard PICU protocols.1 The one exception to the standard protocol was that noninvasive mechanical ventilation was not attempted, since Covid-19 was suspected.\nAlvaro Coronado Munoz, M.D.\nUpulie Nawaratne, M.D.\nDavid McMann, M.D.\nMisti Ellsworth, M.D.\nJon Meliones, M.D.\nKonstantinos Boukas, M.D.\nUniversity of Texas Health Science Center at Houston, Houston, TX\nalvaro.j.coronadomunoz@uth.tmc.edu\nDisclosure forms provided by the authors are available with the full text of this case at NEJM.org.\nThis case was published on April 22, 2020, at NEJM.org.\n1 Reference\nSupplementary Material\nSupplementary Appendix PDF 138KB\nDisclosure Forms PDF 199KB\nComments (14)", "10.1056/NEJMc2009191": "TO THE EDITOR:\nFrom February 28 through March 21, 2020, in three hospitals in northern Italy, we examined five patients who had Guillain\u2013Barr\u00e9 syndrome after the onset of coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19), the disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). During that period, an estimated 1000 to 1200 patients with Covid-19 were admitted to these hospitals. Four of the patients in this series had a positive nasopharyngeal swab for SARS-CoV-2 at the onset of the neurologic syndrome, and one had a negative nasopharyngeal swab and negative bronchoalveolar lavage but subsequently had a positive serologic test for the virus. Detailed case reports are provided in the Supplementary Appendix, available with the full text of this letter at NEJM.org.\nTable 1.\nCharacteristics of Five Patients with Guillain\u2013Barr\u00e9 Syndrome after the Onset of Covid-19.\nThe first symptoms of Guillain\u2013Barr\u00e9 syndrome were lower-limb weakness and paresthesia in four patients and facial diplegia followed by ataxia and paresthesia in one patient (Table 1). Generalized, flaccid tetraparesis or tetraplegia evolved over a period of 36 hours to 4 days in four patients; three received mechanical ventilation. The interval between the onset of symptoms of Covid-19 and the first symptoms of Guillain\u2013Barr\u00e9 syndrome ranged from 5 to 10 days (Table 1 and Fig. S1 in the Supplementary Appendix). None of the patients had dysautonomic features.\nOn analysis of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), two patients had a normal protein level and all the patients had a white-cell count of less than 5 per cubic millimeter. Antiganglioside antibodies were absent in the three patients who were tested. In all the patients, a real-time polymerase-chain-reaction assay of the CSF was negative for SARS-CoV-2. Results of electrophysiological studies are shown in Table S1. Compound muscle action potential amplitudes were low but could be obtained; two patients had prolonged motor distal latencies. On electromyography, fibrillation potentials were present in three patients initially; in another patient, they were absent initially but were present at 12 days. The findings were generally consistent with an axonal variant of Guillain\u2013Barr\u00e9 syndrome in three patients and with a demyelinating process in two patients.1 Magnetic resonance imaging, performed with the administration of gadolinium, showed enhancement of the caudal nerve roots in two patients, enhancement of the facial nerve in one patient, and no signal changes in nerves in two patients. Additional laboratory findings are shown in Table S2.\nAll the patients were treated with intravenous immune globulin (IVIG); two received a second course of IVIG and one started plasma exchange. At 4 weeks after treatment, two patients remained in the intensive care unit and were receiving mechanical ventilation, two were undergoing physical therapy because of flaccid paraplegia and had minimal upper-limb movement, and one had been discharged and was able to walk independently.\nThe interval of 5 to 10 days between the onset of viral illness and the first symptoms of Guillain\u2013Barr\u00e9 syndrome is similar to the interval seen with Guillain\u2013Barr\u00e9 syndrome that occurs during or after other infections.2 Although many infectious agents have been associated with Guillain\u2013Barr\u00e9 syndrome, there may be a propensity for preceding infection with Campylobacter jejuni, Epstein\u2013Barr virus, cytomegalovirus, and Zika virus. There have been reports of an association between Guillain\u2013Barr\u00e9 syndrome and coronavirus infections.3,4\nOn the basis of this observational series involving five patients, it is not possible to determine whether severe deficits and axonal involvement are typical features of Covid-19\u2013associated Guillain\u2013Barr\u00e9 syndrome. We could not determine the effect of reduced vital capacity due to neuromuscular failure from Guillain\u2013Barr\u00e9 syndrome in these patients, but such an effect might be considered if findings on chest imaging are not commensurate with the severity of respiratory insufficiency. Guillain\u2013Barr\u00e9 syndrome with Covid-19 should be distinguished from critical illness neuropathy and myopathy, which tend to appear later in the course of critical illness than Guillain\u2013Barr\u00e9 syndrome.\nGianpaolo Toscano, M.D.\nIRCCS C.

Here, we characterize the first 393 consecutive patients with Covid-19 who were admitted to two hospitals in New York City.\nThis retrospective case series includes adults 18 years of age or older with confirmed Covid-19 who were consecutively admitted between March 3 (date of the first positive case) and March 27, 2020, at an 862-bed quaternary referral center and an affiliated 180-bed nonteaching community hospital in Manhattan. Both hospitals adopted an early-intubation strategy with limited use of high-flow nasal cannulae during this period. Cases were confirmed through reverse-transcriptase\u2013polymerase-chain-reaction assays performed on nasopharyngeal swab specimens. Data were manually abstracted from electronic health records with the use of a quality-controlled protocol and structured abstraction tool (details are provided in the Methods section in the Supplementary Appendix, available with the full text of this letter at NEJM.org).\nTable 1.\nCharacteristics of the Patients.\nAmong the 393 patients, the median age was 62.2 years, 60.6% were male, and 35.8% had obesity (Table 1). The most common presenting symptoms were cough (79.4%), fever (77.1%), dyspnea (56.5%), myalgias (23.8%), diarrhea (23.7%), and nausea and vomiting (19.1%) (Table S1 in the Supplementary Appendix). Most of the patients (90.0%) had lymphopenia, 27% had thrombocytopenia, and many had elevated liver-function values and inflammatory markers. Between March 3 and April 10, respiratory failure leading to invasive mechanical ventilation developed in 130 patients (33.1%); to date, only 43 of these patients (33.1%) have been extubated. In total, 40 of the patients (10.2%) have died, and 260 (66.2%) have been discharged from the hospital; outcome data are incomplete for the remaining 93 patients (23.7%).\nPatients who received invasive mechanical ventilation were more likely to be male, to have obesity, and to have elevated liver-function values and inflammatory markers (ferritin, d-dimer, C-reactive protein, and procalcitonin) than were patients who did not receive invasive mechanical ventilation. Of the patients who received invasive mechanical ventilation, 40 (30.8%) did not need supplemental oxygen during the first 3 hours after presenting to the emergency department. Patients who received invasive mechanical ventilation were more likely to need vasopressor support (95.4% vs. 1.5%) and to have other complications, including atrial arrhythmias (17.7% vs. 1.9%) and new renal replacement therapy (13.3% vs. 0.4%).\nAmong these 393 patients with Covid-19 who were hospitalized in two New York City hospitals, the manifestations of the disease at presentation were generally similar to those in a large case series from China1; however, gastrointestinal symptoms appeared to be more common than in China (where these symptoms occurred in 4 to 5% of patients). This difference could reflect geographic variation or differential reporting. Obesity was common and may be a risk factor for respiratory failure leading to invasive mechanical ventilation.3 The percentage of patients in our case series who received invasive mechanical ventilation was more than 10 times as high as that in China; potential contributors include the more severe disease in our cohort (since testing and hospitalization in the United States is largely limited to patients with more severe disease) and the early-intubation strategy used in our hospitals. Regardless, the high demand for invasive mechanical ventilation has the potential to overwhelm hospital resources. Deterioration occurred in many patients whose condition had previously been stable; almost a third of patients who received invasive mechanical ventilation did not need supplemental oxygen at presentation. The observations that the patients who received invasive mechanical ventilation almost universally received vasopressor support and that many also received new renal replacement therapy suggest that there is also a need to strengthen stockpiles and supply chains for these resources.\nParag Goyal, M.D.\nJustin J.

The only certainty is that the wave is coming,\u201d Jean-Paul Fontaine says. He is the head of the emergency department (ED) at H\u00f4pital Saint Louis in Paris. In November 2015, the hospital\u2019s ED and intensive care unit (ICU) were inundated with victims of the terrorist attack that happened here (www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp1515229\n. opens in new tab\n). Now, they are inundated with patients attacked by a different kind of enemy: SARS-CoV-2.\nFontaine\u2019s role is to prepare for the arrival of patients with Covid-19 while overseeing care for the ED\u2019s other patients. This task has required making architectural modifications, training personnel in procedures to prevent disease transmission, and establishing new roles and workflows. Crisis meetings take place daily at several levels \u2014 including meetings at the hospital and for the entire APHP (Assistance Publique\u2013H\u00f4pitaux de Paris, the network of 39 public hospitals in Paris). \u201cAn important task was to respond to requests for tripling of intensive care beds, but also relocation of several services,\u201d Fontaine says.\nCarl Ogereau was in charge of the ED on November 13, 2015, and managed care for the flood of severely wounded patients that arrived that Friday night. His current role is to quickly assess patients with Covid-19 and determine whether they need to be admitted to the ICU, while also overseeing the usual stream of referrals to the ED. During the early stage of the pandemic, everything in the ED was slowed down by the complexity of the necessary procedures and by the staff\u2019s lack of experience with them. \u201cAt the same time, we were facing the unknown, about the disease, but also about the impact this unprecedented outbreak would have on any of us, including our colleagues, and the health care system at large,\u201d Ogereau says. \u201cFor most of us, this has led to an unforeseen amount of stress, anxiety, and fear.\u201d In 2015, the hospital was fully staffed within hours of the attack. Doctors on call and department heads had to come up with immediate solutions. The guiding principle was resilience. In 2020, the key word is creativity. \u201cWe literally had to create new departments, new roles, and new workflows. Although we had more time than in 2015, the changes had to happen at a much larger scale,\u201d Ogereau says.\nThe number of surgical beds at H\u00f4pital Saint Louis has been dramatically reduced, and the postoperative care room has been transformed into an ICU for patients with Covid-19. A surgical committee has to assess each procedure\u2019s degree of urgency because only 2 of 14 operating rooms are available. All operations that are considered nonurgent are postponed indefinitely. Surgeon Paul Meria worries about the waiting list. \u201cIt is dramatically increasing and will cause problems after the pandemic,\u201d he says.\nNevertheless, Meria is struck by a similarity between the events of 2015 and 2020: the outstanding solidarity of hospital employees. \u201cAll members of medical and nonmedical teams were involved in the management of the patients in 2015, and all of them are currently present to fight the epidemic,\u201d he says.\nOgereau agrees. \u201cFormer trainees and colleagues are volunteering to help in our department,\u201d he says. \u201cClinicians from all medical specialties are taking night shifts in the ED. Everybody wants to be a part of this, because it reminds us that we are a piece of something bigger than our department, bigger than our hospital: the health care of all.\u201d\nOgereau is encouraged to see France\u2019s shelter-in-place order starting to flatten the curve of new infections, and he hopes the burden will soon be bearable for the health care system. \u201cHowever,\u201d he says, \u201cI am still very fearful about the coming weeks and months. This state of chronic anxiety is very different from what we experienced back in 2015. In 2015, there was stupefaction but no fear.\u201d After the terrorist attack, he explains, the motto in Paris was \u201cTous en terrasse!\u201d Social gatherings, including those in caf\u00e9s and bars, helped people move forward after the crisis. Nowadays, the motto is \u201cStay home!\u201d That is a much more depressing way to fight.\nCharlotte Haug, M.D., Ph.D.\nOslo, Norway\nDisclosure forms provided by the author are available with the full text of this note at NEJM.org.\nThis note was published on April 22, 2020, at NEJM.org.\nDr. Haug is an international correspondent for the Journal.\nSupplementary Material\nDisclosure Forms PDF 148KB\nComments (2)", "10.1056/NEJMc2001621": "13 Citing Articles\nTO THE EDITOR:\nThe potential human-to-human transmission of the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has been shown in multiple reports, including data from 425 patients in Wuhan, China.1 Local transmission from a Chinese business partner to a German businessman who attended the same meeting has been reported in Munich, Germany.2 We describe a taxi driver infected with SARS-CoV-2 in Thailand, potentially from Chinese tourists; the infection appears not to have spread to others.\nOn January 20, 2020, a 51-year-old male taxi driver had fever, cough, and myalgia and went to a local pharmacy to get unspecified over-the-counter medications. At the time, he was not aware of the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 or the illness it causes (Covid-19). As the symptoms persisted, he decided to visit a private primary care clinic in Bangkok on January 23. The body temperature was 36.8\u00b0C (98\u00b0F). The clinic physician ordered a throat swab for influenza A and B; the swab was negative for both strains. Additional medications were prescribed for treatment of the patient\u2019s symptoms.\nFrom January 24 through 27, the patient was unable to drive the taxi because he felt ill, and he rested at home.

He was classified as a patient under investigation for Covid-19, isolated, and referred to the Bamrasnaradura Infectious Diseases Institute, the national authority responsible for the management of emerging infectious diseases.\nOn arrival at the institute, the patient had a fever and mild dyspnea. He was admitted to the airborne infection isolation room. Chest radiography showed reticular, patchy infiltration of the left lower lung. Throat and nasopharyngeal swabs that were obtained from the patient tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 on real-time reverse-transcriptase\u2013polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR) assay performed at two laboratories: the Thai Red Cross Emerging Infectious Diseases Health Sciences Center, Faculty of Medicine, Chulalongkorn University, and the Department of Medical Sciences, Ministry of Public Health.\nThe patient initially reported that he had no underlying conditions, but hypertension and type 2 diabetes were discovered during the admission. He reported contact with Chinese tourist passengers in his taxi who had had frequent coughing but who wore masks. He had no history of travel to China.\nThe patient had been in clinically stable condition and was discharged on February 5. His wife, son, and nephew \u2014 all of whom lived in the same house as the patient \u2014 were asymptomatic and tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 on RT-PCR assay.

The Covid-19 pandemic has changed that. Protecting our caregivers is essential so that these talented professionals can safely provide compassionate care to our patients. Yet we continue to be stymied by a lack of personal protective equipment (PPE), and the cavalry does not appear to be coming.\nOur supply-chain group has worked around the clock to secure gowns, gloves, face masks, goggles, face shields, and N95 respirators. These employees have adapted to a new normal, exploring every lead, no matter how unusual. Deals, some bizarre and convoluted, and many involving large sums of money, have dissolved at the last minute when we were outbid or outmuscled, sometimes by the federal government. Then we got lucky, but getting the supplies was not easy.\nA lead came from an acquaintance of a friend of a team member. After several hours of vetting, we grew confident of the broker\u2019s professional pedigree and the potential to secure a large shipment of three-ply face masks and N95 respirators. The latter were KN95 respirators, N95s that were made in China. We received samples to confirm that they could be successfully fit-tested. Despite having cleared this hurdle, we remained concerned that the samples might not be representative of the bulk of the products that we would be buying. Having acquired the requisite funds \u2014 more than five times the amount we would normally pay for a similar shipment, but still less than what was being requested by other brokers \u2014 we set the plan in motion. Three members of the supply-chain team and a fit tester were flown to a small airport near an industrial warehouse in the mid-Atlantic region. I arrived by car to make the final call on whether to execute the deal. Two semi-trailer trucks, cleverly marked as food-service vehicles, met us at the warehouse. When fully loaded, the trucks would take two distinct routes back to Massachusetts to minimize the chances that their contents would be detained or redirected.\nHours before our planned departure, we were told to expect only a quarter of our original order. We went anyway, since we desperately needed any supplies we could get. Upon arrival, we were jubilant to see pallets of KN95 respirators and face masks being unloaded. We opened several boxes, examined their contents, and hoped that this random sample would be representative of the entire shipment. Before we could send the funds by wire transfer, two Federal Bureau of Investigation agents arrived, showed their badges, and started questioning me. No, this shipment was not headed for resale or the black market. The agents checked my credentials, and I tried to convince them that the shipment of PPE was bound for hospitals. After receiving my assurances and hearing about our health system\u2019s urgent needs, the agents let the boxes of equipment be released and loaded into the trucks. But I was soon shocked to learn that the Department of Homeland Security was still considering redirecting our PPE. Only some quick calls leading to intervention by our congressional representative prevented its seizure. I remained nervous and worried on the long drive back, feelings that did not abate until midnight, when I received the call that the PPE shipment was secured at our warehouse.\nThis experience might have made for an entertaining tale at a cocktail party, had the success of our mission not been so critical. Did I foresee, as a health-system leader working in a rich, highly developed country with state-of-the-art science and technology and incredible talent, that my organization would ever be faced with such a set of circumstances? Of course not. Yet when encountering the severe constraints that attend this pandemic, we must leave no stone unturned to give our health care teams and our patients a fighting chance. This is the unfortunate reality we face in the time of Covid-19.\nAndrew W.

(now published in the Journal) is much needed.1 However, their failure to discuss bias, discrimination, or disability is a glaring omission. Their primary recommendation is to maximize benefits by shifting resources to patients with a better prognosis and to focus on life-years saved \u2014 a recommendation that builds on earlier arguments for prioritizing the life of a younger patient over that of an older patient with a similar prognosis, since this benefits the person with the most to lose.2 But maximizing longevity, as opposed to merely maximizing lives saved, demands judgment calls that are subject to discriminatory, often implicit, social biases to which health care providers are not immune.3 This could result in morally and legally unacceptable discrimination against disabled, poor, and minority patients.4 Therefore, these recommendations must be supplemented with explicit guidance against such discrimination. This guidance should be realized in antidiscriminatory criteria that limit the factors that can be considered or by development of triage committees5 that are focused on antidiscrimination, to whom factors such as disability (unrelated to prognosis), socioeconomic status, race, and insurance status are not disclosed. Alternatively, these criteria or committees might explicitly attempt to balance the concern for maximizing prognosis with concerns about social justice.\nMatthew J.

The authors recommend that health care workers in ICUs act in a way that strives to save the most life-years. To meet the requirements of the law, the principles must also uphold the protected rights of all persons. These rights include those of weak, old, and disabled persons.\nEthical recommendations translate poorly into practical policy advice, unless legal rights are considered. For example, Emanuel et al. advise health care workers to remove patients from ICU beds and ventilators (without their consent) to give the resources to other patients who have a better chance of surviving for more life-years. This practice is unlawful in the United Kingdom and in various other European countries. It is a criminal offense and a civil wrong (battery or assault) to physically remove intubation, unless the patient or a legal representative consents or unless ventilation is not clinically indicated. It could also be a breach of Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights, which protects patients from inhuman and degrading treatment. The life-years approach could also be considered unlawful discrimination.\nKathleen Liddell, D.Phil., LL.B.\nStevie Martin, Ph.D., LL.M.\nStephanie Palmer, S.J.D., LL.M.\nUniversity of Cambridge, Cambridge, United Kingdom\nk.liddell@law.cam.ac.uk\nDr. Liddell reports receiving a grant (NNF17SA0027784) from the Novo Nordisk Foundation for the scientifically independent Collaborative Research Program for Biomedical Innovation Law. No other potential conflict of interest relevant to this letter was reported.\nThis letter was published on April 28, 2020, at NEJM.org.\nTO THE EDITOR\nTwo articles in the Journal (by Emanuel et al. and by Truog et al.) concur that withdrawal of life support could be justified during the acute shortages resulting from the Covid-19 crisis. But Emanuel et al. seem to support this practice whenever a candidate for life support would have even slightly better benefit than a patient who is already receiving life support. That much is suggested by their highest priority of maximizing benefits over other guiding principles and their complete rejection of first-come, first-served allocation of resources.\nThe experience of withdrawal of care after the earthquake in Haiti in 2010 was morally distressing to clinicians.1 Analysis of this experience uncovered reasons to give limited priority to existing patients over new candidates. The most obvious reason is that introduction and removal of life support are burdensome, costly, and pose a risk of infection. Withdrawal of care from a patient may also harm staff morale and public trust, which are essential resources during times of emergency. For these and for additional reasons, withdrawal of care should be pursued only when the gap in prospects for patients is large.1\nPaul Firth, M.B., Ch.B.\nMassachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA\npfirth@partners.org\nNir Eyal, D.Phil.\nRutgers University, New Brunswick, NJ\nNo potential conflict of interest relevant to this letter was reported.\nThis letter was published on April 28, 2020, at NEJM.org.\n1 Reference\nTO THE EDITOR\nEmanuel et al. discuss allocation of scarce medical resources in the context of expected overwhelming of the health care system during the Covid-19 pandemic. The four values outlined by the authors \u2014 maximizing benefits, equal treatment, instrumental value, and giving priority to patients who are worst off \u2014 frame their recommendations for resource allocation nicely. However, putting these suggestions into practice requires four additional considerations. First, ethical analysis cannot be devoid of contextual influences, especially in a pandemic: the governance scenarios under which Covid-19 is being handled appear to be chaotic, based on weak evidence, and politically motivated.1 Second, ethical analysis needs to account for relational effects, such as family responsibilities. For example, a middle-aged person may be the caretaker of children and elderly parents and would represent a different value for decisions.2 Third, \u201crandom allocation\u201d for patients with a similar prognosis is challenging because it assumes consensus among clinicians of prognostic indicators and an understanding of randomness, a potentially difficult concept for laypersons to grasp.3 Fourth, preventing abuse of any resource allocation process is of critical importance, especially during a pandemic, and currently the level of social trust in any central process appears to be low.\nAdnan A. Hyder, M.D., Ph.D.\nGeorge Washington University Milken Institute School of Public Health, Washington, DC\nNo potential conflict of interest relevant to this letter was reported.\nThis letter was published on April 28, 2020, at NEJM.org.\n3 References\nRESPONSE\nThe authors reply: We absolutely agree with Brown and Goodwin that discrimination on the basis of race, wealth, disability, and other factors such as those they mention is wrong and should be prohibited in rationing decisions. We also agree that disabilities and illnesses that affect prognosis are different from those that do not affect prognosis. Any measure of prognosis must be based on empirical evidence rather than subjective intuition and quality-of-life judgments. We recommend the use of guidelines and triage committees to preclude the arbitrariness and bias endemic to improvised, bedside rationing.\nLegitimate consideration of prognosis does not constitute age discrimination, even if it may disadvantage some older patients \u2014 or younger ones, as is likely to be the case with Covid-19 vaccines.1 Because our approach extends across multiple interventions, we do not propose a uniform view with respect to age. One prominent proposal for ventilator allocation does incorporate age: the approach rejects discriminatory stereotypes and endorses the compelling view that each year of life is valuable and that priority should go to those who have had fewer life-years.2 Such a priority would also help counteract the life-shortening social inequalities that Brown and Goodwin identify.3\nAlthough reallocating lifesaving treatment is tragic, the tragedy stems from scarcity, not triage. Contrary to the statements of Liddell et al., reallocating ventilators from patients who are unlikely to benefit to those who are is consistent with human rights. U.S. pandemic guidelines recommend such reallocation.4 In addition, there is little U.K. precedent for the prohibition of reallocation. Prohibiting reallocation would be a Pyrrhic victory \u2014 it would avoid the tragedy of ventilator removal only by proliferating tragic situations in which people with good prognoses die for want of a ventilator. Reallocating ventilators to save more lives will also save more people with disabilities because most disabilities do not affect prognosis.\nFirth and Eyal conflate withdrawal of interventions with withdrawal of care. No patient should be refused care, but that differs from entitlement to scarce interventions.\nHyder\u2019s suggestion recalls previous proposals in global health to \u201cweight\u201d life-years toward middle-aged persons who have dependents. Protecting dependents from the loss of a caregiver is important, but a person\u2019s relationship to dependents is hard to assess in a crisis, and the assessment risks becoming a judgment of social worth. In contrast, priority for health care workers and first responders is justified because they undertake risks to save others in a pandemic.5\nGovind Persad, J.D., Ph.D.\nUniversity of Denver Sturm College of Law, Denver, CO\nJames Phillips, M.D.\nGeorge Washington University School of Medicine, Washington, DC\nEzekiel J.

As of January 29, there were 7 confirmed imported cases of infection with SARS-CoV-2 to Taiwan. We identified a case of locally transmitted infection in Taiwan from a wife to her husband.\nOn January 25, 2020, a 52-year-old woman with a history of type 2 diabetes presented with fever to an emergency department in central Taiwan. She was admitted to the hospital because of suspicion of pneumonia associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. She had lived in Wuhan from October 21, 2019, to January 20, 2020. She returned to Taiwan from Wuhan on January 20 on an airplane. On the same day, a throat swab was obtained from another passenger on that flight; that passenger was confirmed to have the first known imported case of SARS-CoV-2 infection in Taiwan when the swab was found to be positive for the virus on January 21.\nFigure 1.\nImaging of the Wife\u2019s Chest.\nFever and myalgia developed in the woman on January 25, a total of 5 days after she returned to Taiwan from Wuhan. She reported that she did not have cough, dyspnea, chest pain, or diarrhea. Chest radiography showed diffuse infiltrates in the bilateral lower lungs (Figure 1A). Assays to detect influenza viruses and a respiratory panel to detect adenovirus, human rhinovirus, parainfluenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus, Bordetella pertussis, Chlamydia pneumoniae, and Mycoplasma pneumoniae were all negative. A throat swab was positive for SARS-CoV-2 on real-time reverse-transcription\u2013polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR) assays on January 273,4; this was the fifth confirmed imported case of Covid-19 (the illness caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection) in Taiwan.\nOn day 1 of hospitalization, the patient received supportive therapies, and oseltamivir and levofloxacin were added as empirical therapy on day 3 of hospitalization after SARS-CoV-2 was detected on RT-PCR. Cough, rhinorrhea, and sore throat developed on day 5, and chest radiography revealed progressive diffuse interstitial opacities and consolidation in the bilateral parahilar areas and lower lung fields (Figure 1B). She continued to receive supportive therapy with oseltamivir and levofloxacin, but she did not receive oxygen therapy. As of February 11, she remained hospitalized, but her vital signs were stable and she was not receiving oxygen therapy.\nThe patient\u2019s 50-year-old husband is a music producer who works primarily at home in Taiwan. He reported that he had not traveled to any region where SARS-CoV-2 transmission was known to be occurring and that he had no known contacts with any person returning from such a region; this was confirmed by an investigation by the government health care unit in Taiwan. On January 21, he met his wife when she returned to Taiwan. They shared a bedroom and meals at home.\nOn January 25, the husband sought medical treatment at the same time as his wife. He presented only with rhinorrhea; he did not have fever, cough, dyspnea, chest pain, or diarrhea. He was admitted to the hospital because of concern regarding Covid-19, given his close contact with his wife. A complete blood count and chest radiography did not show any abnormalities. Assays for influenza viruses and a respiratory panel were negative, but SARS-CoV-2 was detected on RT-PCR on January 28.\nThe husband\u2019s symptoms developed on the same day as those of his wife, January 25. This suggests transmission shortly after his wife returned to Taiwan. During the hospital stay, he had rhinorrhea, and myalgia developed on January 27, but he did not have fever (see Fig. S1 in the Supplementary Appendix, available with the full text of this letter at NEJM.org). He received supportive therapy without any antiviral agents or antibiotics. As of February 11, he remained hospitalized, but his vital signs were stable and he was not receiving oxygen therapy.\nLocal transmission of SARS-CoV-2 infection occurred in this couple in Taiwan.

The patients received similar evaluations by intensivists in two intensive care units (ICUs) in Strasbourg, France, between March 3 and April 3, 2020.\nSix patients were excluded because of paralytic neuromuscular blockade when neurologic data were collected or because they had died without a neurologic examination having been performed. In all 58 patients, reverse-transcriptase\u2013polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR) assays of nasopharyngeal samples were positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The median age of the patients was 63 years, and the median Simplified Acute Physiology Score II at the time of neurologic examination was 52 (interquartile range, 37 to 65, on a scale ranging from 0 to 163, with higher scores indicating greater severity of illness). Seven patients had had previous neurologic disorders, including transient ischemic attack, partial epilepsy, and mild cognitive impairment.\nTable 1.\nCharacteristics of the Patients with Covid-19 and ARDS.\nThe neurologic findings were recorded in 8 of the 58 patients (14%) on admission to the ICU (before treatment) and in 39 patients (67%) when sedation and a neuromuscular blocker were withheld. Agitation was present in 40 patients (69%) when neuromuscular blockade was discontinued (Table 1). A total of 26 of 40 patients were noted to have confusion according to the Confusion Assessment Method for the ICU; those patients could be evaluated when they were responsive (i.e., they had a score of \u22121 to 1 on the Richmond Agitation and Sedation Scale, on a scale of \u22125 [unresponsive] to +4 [combative]). Diffuse corticospinal tract signs with enhanced tendon reflexes, ankle clonus, and bilateral extensor plantar reflexes were present in 39 patients (67%). Of the patients who had been discharged at the time of this writing, 15 of 45 (33%) had had a dysexecutive syndrome consisting of inattention, disorientation, or poorly organized movements in response to command.\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain was performed in 13 patients (Figs. S1 through S3 in the Supplementary Appendix, available with the full text of this letter at NEJM.org). Although these patients did not have focal signs that suggested stroke, they underwent MRI because of unexplained encephalopathic features. Enhancement in leptomeningeal spaces was noted in 8 patients, and bilateral frontotemporal hypoperfusion was noted in all 11 patients who underwent perfusion imaging. Two asymptomatic patients each had a small acute ischemic stroke with focal hyperintensity on diffusion-weighted imaging and an overlapping decreased apparent diffusion coefficient, and 1 patient had a subacute ischemic stroke with superimposed increased diffusion-weighted imaging and apparent diffusion coefficient signals.\nIn the 8 patients who underwent electroencephalography, only nonspecific changes were detected; 1 of the 8 patients had diffuse bifrontal slowing consistent with encephalopathy. Examination of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples obtained from 7 patients showed no cells; in 2 patients, oligoclonal bands were present with an identical electrophoretic pattern in serum, and protein and IgG levels were elevated in 1 patient. RT-PCR assays of the CSF samples were negative for SARS-CoV-2 in all 7 patients.\nIn this consecutive series of patients, ARDS due to SARS-CoV-2 infection was associated with encephalopathy, prominent agitation and confusion, and corticospinal tract signs. Two of 13 patients who underwent brain MRI had single acute ischemic strokes.

(00:42)\nAerosols and droplets generated during speech have been implicated in the person-to-person transmission of viruses,1,2 and there is current interest in understanding the mechanisms responsible for the spread of Covid-19 by these means. The act of speaking generates oral fluid droplets that vary widely in size,1 and these droplets can harbor infectious virus particles. Whereas large droplets fall quickly to the ground, small droplets can dehydrate and linger as \u201cdroplet nuclei\u201d in the air, where they behave like an aerosol and thereby expand the spatial extent of emitted infectious particles.2 We report the results of a laser light-scattering experiment in which speech-generated droplets and their trajectories were visualized.\nThe output from a 532-nm green laser operating at 2.5-W optical power was transformed into a light sheet that was approximately 1 mm thick and 150 mm tall. We directed this light sheet through slits on the sides of a cardboard box measuring 53\u00d746\u00d762 cm. The interior of the box was painted black. The enclosure was positioned under a high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter to eliminate dust.\nWhen a person spoke through the open end of the box, droplets generated during speech traversed approximately 50 to 75 mm before they encountered the light sheet. An iPhone 11 Pro video camera aimed at the light sheet through a hole (7 cm in diameter) on the opposite side of the box recorded sound and video of the light-scattering events at a rate of 60 frames per second. The size of the droplets was estimated from ultrahigh-resolution recordings. Video clips of the events while the person was speaking, with and without a face mask, are available with the full text of this letter at NEJM.org.\nFigure 1.\nEmission of Droplets While a Person Said \u201cStay Healthy.\u201d\nWe found that when the person said \u201cstay healthy,\u201d numerous droplets ranging from 20 to 500 \u03bcm were generated. These droplets produced flashes as they passed through the light sheet (Figure 1). The brightness of the flashes reflected the size of the particles and the fraction of time they were present in a single 16.7-msec frame of the video. The number of flashes in a single frame of the video was highest when the \u201cth\u201d sound in the word \u201chealthy\u201d was pronounced (Figure 1A). Repetition of the same phrase three times, with short pauses in between the phrases, produced a similar pattern of generated particles, with peak numbers of flashes as high as 347 with the loudest speech and as low as 227 when the loudness was slightly decreased over the three trials (see the top trace in Figure 1A). When the same phrase was uttered three times through a slightly damp washcloth over the speaker\u2019s mouth, the flash count remained close to the background level (mean, 0.1 flashes); this showed a decrease in the number of forward-moving droplets (see the bottom trace in Figure 1A).\nWe found that the number of flashes increased with the loudness of speech; this finding was consistent with previous observations by other investigators.3 In one study, droplets emitted during speech were smaller than those emitted during coughing or sneezing. Some studies have shown that the number of droplets produced by speaking is similar to the number produced by coughing.4\nWe did not assess the relative roles of droplets generated during speech, droplet nuclei,2 and aerosols in the transmission of viruses. Our aim was to provide visual evidence of speech-generated droplets and to qualitatively describe the effect of a damp cloth cover over the mouth to curb the emission of droplets.\nPhilip Anfinrud, Ph.D.\nValentyn Stadnytskyi, Ph.D.\nNational Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD\nChristina E.

This process is complicated by epidemiologic uncertainty regarding possible transmission of the virus by asymptomatically or subclinically symptomatic infected persons. It is unclear whether persons who show no signs or symptoms of respiratory infection shed SARS-CoV-2.\nFigure 1.\nEvaluation and Testing of Passengers.\nIn this context, a group of predominantly German nationals who had stayed in Hubei Province was evacuated to Frankfurt, Germany, on February 1, 2020. They were to be transferred to Germersheim, Germany, and quarantined for 14 days, since this period is thought to be the upper limit of the incubation period of SARS-CoV-2. Screening for symptoms and clinical signs of infection was performed before their departure from China. A total of 126 travelers were allowed to board an aircraft operated by the German air force (Figure 1).\nDuring the flight, 10 passengers were isolated. Two passengers had had contact with 1 person who had a confirmed case of SARS-CoV-2 infection, 6 had reported symptoms, were deemed to be clinically symptomatic, or both, and 2 passengers had accompanied family members who had been isolated on the flight because of suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection or because of other symptoms (i.e., symptoms related to pregnancy). These 10 passengers were transferred to University Hospital Frankfurt immediately after arrival. All 10 tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 by real-time reverse-transcription\u2013polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR) assays4 of throat swabs and sputum.\nThe remaining 116 passengers (5 months to 68 years of age), including 23 children, were sent to the medical assessment center at Frankfurt Airport, where each was evaluated by a medical team of physicians. Each passenger was asked to report current symptoms of fever, fatigue, sore throat, cough, runny nose, muscle aches, and diarrhea, and each one was screened for signs of infection in the nose and throat. The temperature of all passengers was taken. All were afebrile except for 1 passenger who had a temperature of 38.4\u00b0C and reported dyspnea and cough. He was transferred to University Hospital Frankfurt for evaluation. However, testing to detect SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR of a throat swab and sputum was negative.\nIn addition to the preplanned multistep process of screening for signs and symptoms of infection and observing the asymptomatic cohort in quarantine, we decided to offer a throat swab to test for SARS-CoV-2 in each of the 115 travelers who had passed triage. A total of 114 passengers consented to the test.\nTwo of the 114 persons (1.8%) in this cohort of travelers who had passed the symptoms-based screening tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR (cycle threshold value in the two samples, 24.39 and 30.25, respectively). Testing with a second protocol consisting of two commercial sets (LightMix Modular SARS and Wuhan CoV E-gene, and LightMix Modular Wuhan CoV RdRP-gene, both produced by TIB MOLBIOL) and retesting of the positive samples at the Institute of Virology, Philipps University Marburg, in Marburg, Germany, confirmed the results. In addition, the isolation of SARS-CoV-2 from both samples in cell culture of Caco-2 cells indicated potential infectivity (see the Supplementary Appendix, available with the full text of this letter at NEJM.org).\nThese two persons were subsequently isolated from the cohort and transferred to the Infectious Disease Unit at University Hospital Frankfurt for further evaluation and observation on the following day. After a thorough evaluation in the hospital ward, a faint rash and minimal pharyngitis were observed in one patient. Both patients remained well and afebrile 7 days after admission.\nIn this effort to evacuate 126 people from Wuhan to Frankfurt, a symptom-based screening process was ineffective in detecting SARS-CoV-2 infection in 2 persons who later were found to have evidence of SARS-CoV-2 in a throat swab. We discovered that shedding of potentially infectious virus may occur in persons who have no fever and no signs or only minor signs of infection.\nSebastian Hoehl, M.D.\nHolger Rabenau, Ph.D.\nAnnemarie Berger, Ph.D.\nMarhild Kortenbusch\nJindrich Cinatl, Ph.D.\nDenisa Bojkova, M.Sc.\nUniversity Hospital Frankfurt, Frankfurt am Main, Germany\nPia Behrens, M.D.\nBoris B\u00f6ddinghaus, M.D.\nUdo G\u00f6tsch, M.D.\nFrank Naujoks, M.D.\nPeter Neumann, M.D.\nJoscha Schork, M.D.\nPetra Tiarks-Jungk, M.D.\nAntoni Walczok, M.D.\nHealth Protection Authority, City of Frankfurt, Frankfurt am Main, Germany\nMarkus Eickmann, Ph.D.\nPhilipps University Marburg, Marburg, Germany\nMaria J.G.T.

SARS-CoV-2 is genetically related to SARS-CoV, which caused a global epidemic with 8096 confirmed cases in more than 25 countries in 2002\u20132003.1 The epidemic of SARS-CoV was successfully contained through public health interventions, including case detection and isolation. Transmission of SARS-CoV occurred mainly after days of illness2 and was associated with modest viral loads in the respiratory tract early in the illness, with viral loads peaking approximately 10 days after symptom onset.3 We monitored SARS-CoV-2 viral loads in upper respiratory specimens obtained from 18 patients (9 men and 9 women; median age, 59 years; range, 26 to 76) in Zhuhai, Guangdong, China, including 4 patients with secondary infections (1 of whom never had symptoms) within two family clusters (Table S1 in the Supplementary Appendix, available with the full text of this letter at NEJM.org). The patient who never had symptoms was a close contact of a patient with a known case and was therefore monitored. A total of 72 nasal swabs (sampled from the mid-turbinate and nasopharynx) (Figure 1A) and 72 throat swabs (Figure 1B) were analyzed, with 1 to 9 sequential samples obtained from each patient. Polyester flock swabs were used for all the patients.\nFrom January 7 through January 26, 2020, a total of 14 patients who had recently returned from Wuhan and had fever (\u226537.3\u00b0C) received a diagnosis of Covid-19 (the illness caused by SARS-CoV-2) by means of reverse-transcriptase\u2013polymerase-chain-reaction assay with primers and probes targeting the N and Orf1b genes of SARS-CoV-2; the assay was developed by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention. Samples were tested at the Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention. Thirteen of 14 patients with imported cases had evidence of pneumonia on computed tomography (CT). None of them had visited the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market in Wuhan within 14 days before symptom onset. Patients E, I, and P required admission to intensive care units, whereas the others had mild-to-moderate illness. Secondary infections were detected in close contacts of Patients E, I, and P. Patient E worked in Wuhan and visited his wife (Patient L), mother (Patient D), and a friend (Patient Z) in Zhuhai on January 17. Symptoms developed in Patients L and D on January 20 and January 22, respectively, with viral RNA detected in their nasal and throat swabs soon after symptom onset. Patient Z reported no clinical symptoms, but his nasal swabs (cycle threshold [Ct] values, 22 to 28) and throat swabs (Ct values, 30 to 32) tested positive on days 7, 10, and 11 after contact. A CT scan of Patient Z that was obtained on February 6 was unremarkable. Patients I and P lived in Wuhan and visited their daughter (Patient H) in Zhuhai on January 11 when their symptoms first developed. Fever developed in Patient H on January 17, with viral RNA detected in nasal and throat swabs on day 1 after symptom onset.\nWe analyzed the viral load in nasal and throat swabs obtained from the 17 symptomatic patients in relation to day of onset of any symptoms (Figure 1C). Higher viral loads (inversely related to Ct value) were detected soon after symptom onset, with higher viral loads detected in the nose than in the throat. Our analysis suggests that the viral nucleic acid shedding pattern of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 resembles that of patients with influenza4 and appears different from that seen in patients infected with SARS-CoV.3 The viral load that was detected in the asymptomatic patient was similar to that in the symptomatic patients, which suggests the transmission potential of asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic patients. These findings are in concordance with reports that transmission may occur early in the course of infection5 and suggest that case detection and isolation may require strategies different from those required for the control of SARS-CoV. How SARS-CoV-2 viral load correlates with culturable virus needs to be determined. Identification of patients with few or no symptoms and with modest levels of detectable viral RNA in the oropharynx for at least 5 days suggests that we need better data to determine transmission dynamics and inform our screening practices.\nLirong Zou, M.Sc.\nGuangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Guangzhou, China\nFeng Ruan, M.Med.\nZhuhai Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Zhuhai, China\nMingxing Huang, Ph.D.\nFifth Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-Sen University, Zhuhai, China\nLijun Liang, Ph.D.\nGuangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Guangzhou, China\nHuitao Huang, B.Sc.\nZhuhai Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Zhuhai, China\nZhongsi Hong, M.D.\nFifth Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-Sen University, Zhuhai, China\nJianxiang Yu, B.Sc.\nMin Kang, M.Sc.\nYingchao Song, B.Sc.\nGuangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Guangzhou, China\nJinyu Xia, M.D.\nFifth Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-Sen University, Zhuhai, China\nQianfang Guo, M.Sc.\nTie Song, M.Sc.\nJianfeng He, B.Sc.\nGuangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Guangzhou, China\nHui-Ling Yen, Ph.D.\nMalik Peiris, Ph.D.\nUniversity of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China\nJie Wu, Ph.D.\nGuangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Guangzhou, China\n771276998@qq.com\nDisclosure forms provided by the authors are available with the full text of this letter at NEJM.org.\nThis letter was published on February 19, 2020, and updated on February 20, 2020, at NEJM.org.\nMs. Zou, Mr. Ruan, and Dr. Huang contributed equally to this letter.\n5 References\nSupplementary Material\nSupplementary Appendix PDF 110KB\nDisclosure Forms PDF 302KB\nCiting Articles (239)"}
