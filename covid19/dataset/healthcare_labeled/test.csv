"The influence of obesity on spine surgery outcomes is highly controversial with a current clinical equipoise. Several studies suggest higher perioperative morbidity with obesity while other studies suggest otherwise. To address this gap in the literature, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis in accordance with the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines with the objective of better defining the impact of obesity on outcomes following lumbar spine surgery. Risk of bias assessment was performed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. Strength of evidence was assessed using the Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) Working Group system. Surgical outcomes such as blood loss, operative time, length of stay, complication and reoperation rates and functional outcomes represented by the change in Oswestry Disability Index and Visual Analog Scale-Back Pain were compared between obese and non-obese patients. A total of 32 studies with 23,415 patients were analyzed. Obese patients had slightly higher surgical blood loss (Mean Difference [MD]: 46.15 ml, CI: 20.21-72, p-value< .001, I2 = 85%) and longer operative times (MD: 17.17 min, CI: 9.91-24.43, p-value< .001, I2 = 95%), but similar length of stay as compared to non-obese patients. Higher complication (OR = 1.34, C.I. = 1.13-1.58, p = 0.01, I2 = 45%) and reoperation rates (OR = 1.40, C.I. = 1.19-1.64, p < 0.001, I2 = 20) were observed in obese patients. The differences, however, were not significant for obese patients undergoing MIS surgery. Functional outcomes (change in ODI and VAS-BP) were similar between the two groups. Overall confidence in GRADE estimates was either low or very low for all outcomes. Obesity might be linked to higher adverse events following lumbar spine surgery. Minimally invasive spine surgery, however, might offer comparable outcomes between obese and non-obese patients. However, further studies are needed to evaluate whether these findings remain valid for morbidly obese (BMI > 40) patients as well.

"Abstract Background: It is still largely unknown whether physical activity (PA) during pregnancy may be useful to avert subsequent postpartum depression (PPD). We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to determine the preventive effects of PA during pregnancy on PPD. Methods: A systematic review of English and non-English articles was conducted using CINAHL, Cochrane Controlled Trials Register, PsycINFO, MEDLINE, SportDiscuss and Web of Science databases. Studies which tested the effect of any type of PA measured during pregnancy on depression or depressive symptoms in the first year postpartum were included. Relevant articles were extracted independently by 2 authors using predefined data fields, including study quality indicators. The protocol was registered on PROSPERO (CRD42018087086). Results: Twenty one studies, fit our selection criteria. Among them, seventeen studies were included in the meta-analysis, representing 93 676 women. Robust Variance Estimation random-effects meta-analysis indicated a significant reduction in postpartum depression scores (Overall SMD = -0.22 [95% CI -0.42 to -0.01], p = 0.04; I2 = 86.4%) for women physically active during pregnancy relative to those who were not active. This association was reinforced in intervention studies (SMD = -0.58 [9% CI -1.09 to -0.08]). Limitations: Overall meta-analysis showed important heterogeneity in PA assessment, suggesting the existence of potential moderators such as intensity, frequency, trimester of pregnancy or type of physical activity practiced. Conclusions: PA during pregnancy appears to reduce the risk of PPD symptoms. High quality studies addressing the role of PA in the perinatal period and its impact on new mother's mental health remain necessary.

"Abstract Background: Elevated blood pressure (hypertension) affects about one billion people worldwide. It is important as it is a major risk factor for stroke and myocardial infarction. However, it remains a challenge for the medical profession as many people with hypertension have blood pressure (BP) that is not well controlled. According to Traditional Chinese Medicine theory, acupuncture has the potential to lower BP. Objectives: To assess the effectiveness and safety of acupuncture for lowering blood pressure in adults with primary hypertension. Search methods: We searched the Hypertension Group Specialised Register (February 2017); the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) 2017, Issue 2; MEDLINE (February 2017); Embase (February 2017), China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) (January 2015), VIP Database (January 2015), the World Health Organisation Clinical Trials Registry Platform (February 2017)and ClinicalTrials.gov (February 2017). There were no language restrictions. Data collection and analysis: Two review authors independently selected studies according to inclusion and exclusion criteria. They extracted data and assessed the risk of bias of each trial, and telephoned or emailed the authors of the studies to ask for missing information. A third review author resolved disagreements. Outcomes included change in systolic blood pressure (SBP), change in diastolic blood pressure (DBP), withdrawal due to adverse effects, and any adverse events. We calculated pooled mean differences (MD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) for continuous outcomes using a fixed-effect or random-effects model where appropriate. Main results: Twenty-two RCTs (1744 people) met our inclusion criteria. The RCTs were of variable methodological quality (most at high risk of bias because of lack of blinding). There was no evidence for a sustained BP lowering effect of acupuncture; only one trial investigated a sustained effect and found no BP lowering effect at three and six months after acupuncture. Four sham acupuncture controlled trials provided very low quality evidence that acupuncture had a short-term (one to 24 hours) effect on SBP (change) -3.4 mmHg (-6.0 to -0.9) and DBP -1.9 mmHg (95% CI -3.6 to -0.3). Pooled analysis of eight trials comparing acupuncture with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and seven trials comparing acupuncture to calcium antagonists suggested that acupuncture lowered short-term BP better than the antihypertensive drugs. However, because of the very high risk of bias in these trials, we think that this is most likely a reflection of bias and not a true effect. As a result, we did not report these results in the 'Summary of findings' table. Safety of acupuncture could not be assessed as only eight trials reported adverse events. Authors' conclusions: At present, there is no evidence for the sustained BP lowering effect of acupuncture that is required for the management of chronically elevated BP. The short-term effects of acupuncture are uncertain due to the very low quality of evidence. The larger effect shown in non-sham acupuncture controlled trials most likely reflects bias and is not a true effect. Future RCTs must use sham acupuncture controls and assess whether there is a BP lowering effect of acupuncture that lasts at least seven days.", 0
"Abstract Objective: Vegetarian diets are consistently associated with improved health outcomes, and higher diet quality may contribute to improved health outcomes. This systematic review aims to qualitatively compare the a priori diet quality of vegetarian and nonvegetarian diets. Methods: Following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) protocol, 2 online databases (Web of Science and PubMed) were searched for English language studies comparing diet quality among vegetarian and nonvegetarian adults using an a priori diet quality index. Two reviewers assessed study eligibility. Comparisons were made between total and component (when available) diet quality scores among the 12 studies meeting inclusion criteria. Conclusions: Lacto-ovo vegetarians or vegans had higher overall diet quality (4.5-16.4 points higher on the Healthy Eating Index 2010 [HEI-2010]) compared with nonvegetarians in 9 of 12 studies. Higher HEI-2010 scores for vegetarians were driven by closer adherence to recommendations for total fruit, whole grains, seafood and plant protein, and sodium. However, nonvegetarians had closer adherence to recommendations for refined grains and total protein foods. Higher diet quality in vegetarian diets may partially explain improvements in health outcomes compared with nonvegetarians; however, more research controlling for known confounders like health consciousness is needed.", 0
"Abstract Background: Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is associated with hypertension, atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, and diabetes. These disorders are also risk factors for stroke. Objective: To determine whether OSA increases the risk of stroke independently of other cerebrovascular risk factors. Methods: The objective was addressed through the development of a structured critically appraised topic. This evidence-based methodology included a clinical scenario, structured question, search strategy, critical appraisal, results, evidence summary, commentary, and bottom line conclusions. Participants included consultant and resident neurologists, a medical librarian, clinical epidemiologists, and content experts in the field of sleep medicine and vascular neurology. Results: A large observational cohort study was selected and appraised to address this prognostic question. The unadjusted analysis revealed that OSA (apnea-hypopnea index >5) was associated with stroke or death from any cause (hazard ratio, 2.24; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.30–3.86; P = 0.004). The adjusted OSA analysis retained a statistically significant association with stroke or death (hazard ratio, 1.97; 95% CI, 1.12–3.48; P = 0.01). In separate unadjusted analyses, OSA was associated with death and stroke with relative risks of 1.68 (95% CI, 1.10–2.25) and 5.16 (95% CI, 3.72–6.60), respectively. Conclusions: OSA independently contributes to stroke risk.", 1
"Abstract Background: Psychogenic nonepileptic seizures (PNES) are often disabling and usually associated with psychiatric disorders and reduced quality of life. Although often suspected based on historical and clinical features, the gold standard for diagnosis of PNES is video electroencephalography. Identification of clinical features that reliably distinguish PNES from ES would be valuable in acute care settings, for patients that have coexisting disorders, and those with multiple event types. Objective: To determine the diagnostic value of putative clinical symptoms or signs of PNES against the gold standard of video electroencephalography. Methods: We addressed the objective through development of a structured critically appraised topic that included a clinical scenario, structured question, search strategy, critical appraisal, results, evidence summary, commentary, and bottom-line conclusions. Participants included consultant and resident neurologists, a medical librarian, clinical epidemiologists, and content experts in the field of epileptology. Results: There were wide variations in the rates of coexisting PNES and epilepsy and study methodology. Ictal stuttering and the “teddy bear” sign were associated with moderate specificity for PNES. However, the presence of pelvic thrusting or ictal eye closure did not accurately distinguish PNES from ES. Conclusions: The presence of either ictal stuttering or the teddy bear sign is moderately specific but poorly sensitive for PNES. Pelvic thrusting and ictal eye closure are not reliable indicators of PNES. Future studies should establish more precise and reliable definitions of clinical signs and evaluate combinations of such signs in a broad spectrum of patients with PNES and ES spell phenotypes that may be difficult to distinguish, such as spells of unresponsiveness with motor manifestations. Because PNES and ES may coexist, analysis of diagnostic accuracy of clinical features should be performed for individual spells.", 1
"Abstract Background: Chronic subdural hematomas (CSDH) occur most commonly in the elderly population. When CSDH patients present with a moderate or severe neurologic deficit and are good surgical candidates, surgery is regarded as the ideal option. However, CSDH patients often have only mild neurologic deficits or are not optimal candidates for surgery. Corticosteroids are often used on these subgroups, but the benefit of this intervention is unknown. Optimal treatment for these patients is not well established. Objective: Critically evaluate the role of corticosteroids in the management of CSDH. Methods: The objective was addressed through the development of a structured critically appraised topic. This included a clinical scenario with a structured question, search strategy, critical appraisal, results, evidence summary, commentary, and bottom line conclusions. Participants included consultant and resident neurologists, a medical librarian, clinical epidemiologists, and clinical content experts in the fields of vascular neurology and neurosurgery. Results: No randomized controlled trials on the topic were discovered. A prospective cohort study was selected as the best currently available evidence. Conclusion: The role of corticosteroids in the management of CSDH is not well defined. Current evidence neither supports nor refutes the use of corticosteroids. A randomized controlled trial is warranted.", 1
"Abstract Background: Despite a large body of resuscitation research, the optimal timing and approach to prognosticating futility after nontraumatic cardiac arrest remains controversial. Postresuscitation anoxic-ischemic encephalopathy may leave patients cognitively disabled and dependent, minimally conscious, or in a persistent vegetative state. Neurologists are frequently called upon to assess comatose postcardiac arrest patients to communicate accurate prognostic information and to assist in planning the most appropriate level of care. Serum neuron specific enolase (NSE), when used in conjunction with other available prognostic tools, may be a useful tool for predicting clinical outcome in this patient population. Objective: Determine the clinical utility of a serum NSE measurement for predicting the neurologic outcome of a survivor after resuscitation from a nontraumatic cardiac arrest. Methods: We addressed the question through the development of a structured, critically appraised topic. Participants included consultant and resident neurologists, clinical epidemiologists, medical librarian, and clinical content experts in the fields of emergency medicine, cardiac resuscitation, and critical care neurology. Participants started with a clinical scenario and a structured question, devised search strategies, located and compiled the best evidence, performed a critical appraisal, synthesized the results, summarized the evidence, provided commentary, and declared bottom-line conclusions. Results: A single recent prospective cohort study, which assessed the predictive value of serum NSE was selected and appraised. A level of 80 ng/mL was determined to predict persistent coma with a sensitivity of 63% (95% CI, 49%–75%), and a specificity of 100% (95% CI, 97%–100%), positive predictive value (PPV) of 100%, negative predictive value (NPV) of 84%, and a negative LR of 0.37. Conclusions: The specificity of serum NSE levels >80 ng/mL is sufficiently high that, when it is used with other clinical and electrophysiological data, it could be useful as a prognostic indicator of neurologic outcome after cardiac arrest. Although serum NSE is an appealing, simple, readily available test, prediction of neurologic outcome after resuscitation from cardiac arrest must not rely solely on a serum biomarker, but must be determined in the context of other patient characteristics and neurologic examination findings.", 1
"Abstract The dominant instructional model within special education, Differential Diagnosis-Prescriptive Teaching, involves the assessment of psycholinguistic and perceptual motor abilities that are presumed necessary for learning basic academic skills. Based on the differential pattern of ability strengths and weaknesses resulting from this assessment, individual remedial prescriptions are prescribed. In this article six assumptions underlying this model are identified. Also presented is a comprehensive review of research related to each assumption. The findings seriously challenge the model’s validity and suggest that continued advocacy of the model cannot be justified. Children do not appear to profit from current applications of Differential Diagnosis-Prescriptive Teaching.", 2
"Abstract To determine the efficacy of continuing medical education (CME), we collected 248 original articles describing studies of CME interventions. These articles were reviewed for applicability and scientific credibility by applying preset methodological criteria. Thirteen percent of articles described randomized trials, but only 7% of all articles and 20% of randomized trials assessed the impact of CME on patient outcomes. Seven articles met all our criteria and were reviewed in detail. These studies provide convincing evidence that CME can improve physician behaviors. However, only three of these methodologically sound studies assessed patient outcomes and only one demonstrated any improvement in outcomes.", 2
"Abstract Propensity‐score methods are increasingly being used to reduce the impact of treatment‐selection bias in the estimation of treatment effects using observational data. Commonly used propensity‐score methods include covariate adjustment using the propensity score, stratification on the propensity score, and propensity‐score matching. Empirical and theoretical research has demonstrated that matching on the propensity score eliminates a greater proportion of baseline differences between treated and untreated subjects than does stratification on the propensity score. However, the analysis of propensity‐score‐matched samples requires statistical methods appropriate for matched‐pairs data. We critically evaluated 47 articles that were published between 1996 and 2003 in the medical literature and that employed propensity‐score matching. We found that only two of the articles reported the balance of baseline characteristics between treated and untreated subjects in the matched sample and used correct statistical methods to assess the degree of imbalance. Thirteen (28 per cent) of the articles explicitly used statistical methods appropriate for the analysis of matched data when estimating the treatment effect and its statistical significance. Common errors included using the log‐rank test to compare Kaplan–Meier survival curves in the matched sample, using Cox regression, logistic regression, chi‐squared tests, t‐tests, and Wilcoxon rank sum tests in the matched sample, thereby failing to account for the matched nature of the data. We provide guidelines for the analysis and reporting of studies that employ propensity‐score matching. Copyright © 2007 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.", 2
"Abstract Severe asthma (SA) is a clinically and etiologically heterogeneous respiratory disease which affects among 5–10 % of asthmatic patients. Despite high-dose therapy, a large patients percentage is not fully controlled and has a poor quality of life. In this review, we describe the biomarkers actually known in scientific literature and used in clinical practice for SA assessment and management: neutrophils, eosinophils, periostin, fractional exhaled nitric oxide, exhaled breath condensate and galectins. Moreover, we give an overview on clinical and biological features characterizing severe asthma, paying special attention to the potential use of these ones as reliable markers. We finally underline the need to define different biomarkers panels to select patients affected by severe asthma for specific and personalized therapeutic approach.", 2
"Abstract Background: Hamstring injuries are the most common muscle injuries in soccer, and they have a high rate of recurrence. Eccentric hamstrings strength is recognized as an important modifiable risk factor. This led to the development of prevention exercises such as the nordic hamstring exercise (NHE). The effectiveness of the NHE on hamstring injury prevention has never been investigated in amateur soccer. Purpose: To investigate the preventive effect of the NHE on the incidence and severity of hamstring injuries in male amateur soccer players. Study design: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 1. Methods: Male amateur soccer players (age, mean ± SD, 24.5 ± 3.8 years) from 40 teams were randomly allocated to an intervention (n = 20 teams, 292 players) or control group (n = 20 teams, 287 players). The intervention group was instructed to perform 25 sessions of NHE in a 13-week period. Both the intervention and control groups performed regular soccer training and were followed for hamstring injury incidence and severity during the 2013 calendar year. At baseline, personal characteristics (eg, age, injury history, field position) were gathered from all participants via a questionnaire. Primary outcome was injury incidence. Secondary outcomes were injury severity and compliance with the intervention protocol. Results: A total of 38 hamstring injuries were recorded, affecting 36 of 579 players (6.2%). The overall injury incidence rate was 0.7 (95% CI, 0.6-0.8) per 1000 player hours, 0.33 (95% CI, 0.25-0.46) in training, and 1.2 (95% CI, 0.82-1.94) in matches. Injury incidence rates were significantly different between the intervention (0.25; 95% CI, 0.19-0.35) and control groups (0.8; 95% CI, 0.61-1.15), χ(2)(1, n = 579) = 7.865; P = .005. The risk for hamstring injuries was reduced in the intervention group compared with the control group (odds ratio, 0.282; 95% CI, 0.110-0.721) and was statistically significant (P = .005). No statistically significant differences were identified between the intervention and control groups regarding injury severity. Compliance with the intervention protocol was 91%. Conclusion: Incorporating the NHE protocol in regular amateur training significantly reduces hamstring injury incidence, but it does not reduce hamstring injury severity. Compliance with the intervention was excellent. Keywords: eccentric strengthening; hamstring injuries; injury prevention; nordic curl; nordic hamstring exercise; soccer.", 3
"Abstract Objective: To assess the effectiveness of pilates method on patients with chronic non-specific low back pain (LBP). Method: A randomized controlled trial was carried out in sixty patients with a diagnosis of chronic non-specific LBP. Patients were randomly assigned to one of two groups: Experimental Group (EG) that maintained medication treatment with use of NSAID and underwent treatment with the pilates method and Control Group (CG) that continue medication treatment with use of NSAID and did not undergo any other intervention. A blinded assessor performed all evaluations at baseline (T0), after 45, 90, and 180 days (T45, T90 and T180) for: pain (VAS), function (Roland Morris questionnaire), quality of life (SF-36), satisfaction with treatment (Likert scale), flexibility (sit and reach test) and NSAID intake. Results: The groups were homogeneous at baseline. Statistical differences favoring the EG were found with regard to pain (P < 0.001), function (P < 0.001) and the quality of life domains of functional capacity (P < 0.046), pain (P < 0.010) and vitality (P < 0.029). Statistical differences were also found between groups regarding the use of pain medication at T45, T90 and T180 (P < 0.010), with the EG taking fewer NSAIDs than the CG. Conclusions: The pilates method can be used by patients with LBP to improve pain, function and aspects related to quality of life (functional capacity, pain and vitality). Moreover, this method has no harmful effects on such patients. Keywords: Low back pain; exercise; pain rehabilitation.", 3
"Abstract Background: Central pain in multiple sclerosis (MS) is common and often refractory to treatment. Methods: We conducted a single-center, 5-week (1-week run-in, 4-week treatment), randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group trial in 66 patients with MS and central pain states (59 dysesthetic, seven painful spasms) of a whole-plant cannabis-based medicine (CBM), containing delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol:cannabidiol (THC:CBD) delivered via an oromucosal spray, as adjunctive analgesic treatment. Each spray delivered 2.7 mg of THC and 2.5 of CBD, and patients could gradually self-titrate to a maximum of 48 sprays in 24 hours. Results: Sixty-four patients (97%) completed the trial, 34 received CBM. In week 4, the mean number of daily sprays taken of CBM (n = 32) was 9.6 (range 2 to 25, SD = 6.0) and of placebo (n = 31) was 19.1 (range 1 to 47, SD = 12.9). Pain and sleep disturbance were recorded daily on an 11-point numerical rating scale. CBM was superior to placebo in reducing the mean intensity of pain (CBM mean change −2.7, 95% CI: −3.4 to −2.0, placebo –1.4 95% CI: −2.0 to −0.8, comparison between groups, p = 0.005) and sleep disturbance (CBM mean change –2.5, 95% CI: −3.4 to −1.7, placebo –0.8, 95% CI: −1.5 to −0.1, comparison between groups, p = 0.003). CBM was generally well tolerated, although more patients on CBM than placebo reported dizziness, dry mouth, and somnolence. Cognitive side effects were limited to long-term memory storage. Conclusions: Cannabis-based medicine is effective in reducing pain and sleep disturbance in patients with multiple sclerosis related central neuropathic pain and is mostly well tolerated.", 3
"Abstract Background  Adolescent girls in the United States and around the world are at a heightened risk for sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Objective  To determine the efficacy of a skill-based HIV/STD risk-reduction intervention in reducing self-reported unprotected sexual intercourse among African American and Latino adolescent girls. Design  Randomized controlled trial with 3-, 6-, and 12-month follow-ups. Setting and Participants  Sexually experienced African American and Latino adolescent girls recruited from the adolescent medicine clinic of a children's hospital serving a low-income inner-city community (N = 682, mean age, 15.5 years); 88.6% were retained at the 12-month follow-up. Interventions  Three 250-minute interventions based on cognitive-behavioral theories and elicitation research: an information-based HIV/STD intervention provided information necessary to practice safer sex; a skill-based HIV/STD intervention provided information and taught skills necessary to practice safer sex; or a health-promotion control intervention concerned with health issues unrelated to sexual behavior. Main Outcome Measures  Primary outcome measure was self-reported frequency of unprotected sexual intercourse; secondary outcomes included the frequency of sexual intercourse while intoxicated, the number of sexual partners, biologically confirmed STDs, and theoretical mediator variables, including the intention to use condoms, beliefs about using condoms, and condom-use knowledge. Results  No differences between the information intervention and the health control intervention were statistically significant. Skills-intervention participants (mean [SE], 2.27 [0.81]) reported less unprotected sexual intercourse at the 12-month follow-up than did information-intervention participants (mean [SE], 4.04 [0.80]; P = .03), or health control–intervention participants (mean [SE], 5.05 [0.81]; P = .002). At the 12-month follow-up, skills-intervention participants (mean [SE], 0.91 [0.05]) reported fewer sexual partners (P = .04) compared with health control–intervention participants (mean [SE], 1.04 [0.05]) and were less likely to test positive for STD (mean [SE], 10.5% [2.9%]) than were health control–intervention participants (mean [SE], 18.2% [2.8%]; P = .05). No differences in the frequency of unprotected sexual intercourse, the number of partners, or the rate of STD were observed at the 3- or 6-month follow-up between skill-intervention participants and information-intervention or health control–intervention participants. Conclusion  Skill-based HIV/STD interventions can reduce sexual risk behaviors and STD rate among African American and Latino adolescent girls in clinic settings.", 3
"Abstract Background: Early-life exposure to the endocrine disruptor bisphenol A (BPA) may contribute to the development of obesity. Prospective evidence in humans on this topic is limited. Objectives: We examined prenatal and early-childhood BPA exposures in relation to childhood measures of adiposity in the Columbia Center for Children's Environmental Health (CCCEH) New York City birth cohort. Methods: BPA concentrations were measured in prenatal (n = 375) and child ages 3 (n = 408) and 5 years (n = 518) spot urine samples. Childhood anthropometric and bioelectrical impedance outcomes included body mass index z-scores (BMIZ) at 5 and 7 years, and fat mass index (FMI), percent body fat (%BF), and waist circumference (WC) at 7 years. Associations were evaluated using multiple linear regression with continuous and tertile BPA concentrations. Results: Prenatal urinary BPA concentrations were positively associated with child age 7 FMI (β = 0.31 kg/m2; 95% CI: 0.01, 0.60, p = 0.04), %BF (β = 0.79; 95% CI: 0.03, 1.55, p = 0.04), and WC (β = 1.29 cm; 95% CI: 0.29, 2.30, p = 0.01), but not BMIZ, or change in BMIZ between ages 5 and 7 years (all p-values > 0.1). FMI results were sex-specific. Child urinary BPA concentrations were not associated with child anthropometric outcomes (all p-values > 0.05). Conclusions: Analyses of the CCCEH longitudinal birth cohort found associations between prenatal urinary BPA concentrations and FMI, %BF, and WC. Our results suggest that prenatal BPA exposure may contribute to developmental origins of adiposity. These findings are consistent with several prior studies, raising concern about the pervasiveness of BPA.

"Abstract Study objectives: There is limited information on the relationship between risk of cardiovascular disease and the joint effects of sleep quality and sleep duration, especially from large, prospective, cohort studies. This study is to prospectively investigate the joint effects of sleep quality and sleep duration on the development of coronary heart disease. Methods: This study examined 60,586 adults aged 40 years or older. A self-administered questionnaire was used to collect information on sleep quality and sleep duration as well as a wide range of potential confounders. Events of coronary heart disease were self-reported in subsequent medical examinations. Two types of Sleep Score (multiplicative and additive) were constructed to reflect the participants' sleep profiles, considering both sleep quality and sleep duration. The Cox regression model was used to estimate the hazard ratio (HR) and the 95% confidence interval (CI). Results: A total of 2,740 participants (4.5%) reported new events of coronary heart disease at follow-up. For sleep duration, participants in the group of < 6 h/d was significantly associated with an increased risk of coronary heart disease (HR: 1.13, 95% CI: 1.04-1.23). However, the association in the participants with long sleep duration (> 8 h/d) did not reach statistical significance (HR: 1.11, 95% CI: 0.98-1.26). For sleep quality, both dreamy sleep (HR: 1.21, 95% CI: 1.10-1.32) and difficult to fall asleep/use of sleeping pills or drugs (HR: 1.40, 95% CI: 1.25-1.56) were associated with an increased risk of the disease. Participants in the lowest quartile of multiplicative Sleep Score (HR: 1.31, 95% CI: 1.16-1.47) and of additive sleep score (HR: 1.31, 95% CI: 1.16-1.47) were associated with increased risk of coronary heart disease compared with those in the highest quartile. Conclusions: Both short sleep duration and poor sleep quality are associated with the risk of coronary heart disease. The association for long sleep duration does not reach statistical significance. Lower Sleep Score (poorer sleep profile) increases the risk of coronary heart disease, suggesting the importance of considering sleep duration and sleep quality together when developing strategies to improve sleep for cardiovascular disease prevention.

"Abstract Background Attitudes influence behaviour. Developing and maintaining proper attitudes by medical students can impact on the quality of health care delivered to their patients as they assume the role of doctors. There is a paucity of longitudinal research reports on the extent to which students' attitude scores shift as they progress through medical school. Objective This study examined the change in attitude scores of a large student cohort as they progressed through medical school. Whether student gender is related to attitude change was also investigated. Method Medical students from 3 consecutive classes (1999–2001) participated in this study. Students completed 2 instruments that included the Attitudes Toward Social Issues in Medicine and an in‐house tool referred to as the Medical Skills Questionnaire. The instruments were administered at 3 milestones during the course of medical school training (entry, end of preclinical training and end of clerkship). Results Reliability estimates for total (0.82–0.91) and subscale (0.41–0.81) attitudinal scores were in the acceptable range. Multivariate analyses of variance of mean attitudinal scores indicated a persistent decline in several attitude scores as students progressed through the medical educational programme. Females demonstrated higher attitude scores than males. Conclusions As students progress through medical school their attitude scores decline. The reasons for the shift in attitude scores are not clear but they may relate to a ceiling of high attitude scores at entry, loss of idealism and the impact of the unintended curriculum. Further study of the impact of medical education on student attitudes is warranted.", 4
"Abstract Introduction: The requirements of professionalism and the expected qualities of medical staff, including high moral character, motivate institutions to care about the ethical development of students during their medical education. We assessed progress in moral reasoning in a cohort of medical students over the first 3 years of their education. Methods: We invited all 92 medical students enrolled at the University of Sherbrooke, Que., to complete a questionnaire on moral reasoning at the start of their first year of medical school and at the end of their third year. We used the French version of Kohlberg's Moral Judgment Interview. Responses to the questionnaire were coded by stage of moral development, and weighted average scores were assigned according to frequency of use of each stage. Results: Of the 92 medical students, 54 completed the questionnaire in the fall of the first year and again at the end of their third year. The average age of the students at the end of the third year was 21 years, and 79% of the students included in the study were women. Over the 3-year period, the stage of moral development did not change substantially (i.e., by more than half a stage) for 39 (72%) of the students, shifted to a lower stage for 7 (13%) and shifted to a higher stage for 8 (15%). The overall mean change in stage was not significant (from mean 3.46 in year 1 to 3.48 in year 3, p = 0.86); however, the overall mean change in weighted average scores showed a significant decline in moral development (p = 0.028). Interpretation: Temporal variations in students' scores show a levelling process of their moral reasoning. This finding prompts us to ask whether a hidden curriculum exists in the structure of medical education that inhibits rather than facilitates the development of moral reasoning.", 4
"Abstract Study objective: This research examined the impact of daylight exposure on the health of office workers from the perspective of subjective well-being and sleep quality as well as actigraphy measures of light exposure, activity, and sleep-wake patterns. Methods: Participants (N = 49) included 27 workers working in windowless environments and 22 comparable workers in workplaces with significantly more daylight. Windowless environment is defined as one without any windows or one where workstations were far away from windows and without any exposure to daylight. Well-being of the office workers was measured by Short Form-36 (SF-36), while sleep quality was measured by Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). In addition, a subset of participants (N = 21; 10 workers in windowless environments and 11 workers in workplaces with windows) had actigraphy recordings to measure light exposure, activity, and sleep-wake patterns. Results: Workers in windowless environments reported poorer scores than their counterparts on two SF-36 dimensions--role limitation due to physical problems and vitality--as well as poorer overall sleep quality from the global PSQI score and the sleep disturbances component of the PSQI. Compared to the group without windows, workers with windows at the workplace had more light exposure during the workweek, a trend toward more physical activity, and longer sleep duration as measured by actigraphy. Conclusions: We suggest that architectural design of office environments should place more emphasis on sufficient daylight exposure of the workers in order to promote office workers' health and well-being. Keywords: architectural design; light exposure; office environment; quality of life; sleep quality.", 5
"Abstract Objective: The association between serum vitamin D and migraine is investigated in this research.s BACKGROUND: Although the pathogenesis of migraine headache is not fully understood, the possible role of inflammation and disturbed immune system has been proposed; thus, higher levels of vitamin D might reduce the risk of migraine. However, the results of related studies have been inconclusive. Methods: Seventy healthy individuals and 70 age- and sex-matched migraineurs (34 chronic and 36 episodic migraineurs), diagnosed according to the International Headache Society criteria (ICHD-IIIβ), were recruited. After obtaining baseline data and assessing migraine disability, a 30-day headache diary was given to the participants. Blood samples were obtained and 25(OH)D serum concentrations were determined using ELISA techniques. Serum 25(OH)D under 20, 20-29, and 30-100 ng/mL were considered deficient, insufficient, and sufficient, respectively. The applied statistical tests for between-group comparisons include independent-sample t-test, chi-square, and analysis of variance. Multiple regression analysis was also performed to identify the possible risk factors of migraine headache. Results: Migraine patients had significantly lower mean (SD) of serum VitD (30 (16) ng/mL) than healthy subjects (43 (19) ng/mL) (P < .001). The number (%) of subjects with VitD deficiency and insufficiency was significantly higher among the migraineurs (36 (53.7%)) than the controls (18 (26.1%)) (P < .0001). A significant negative association between migraine headache and serum VitD was detected in the fully adjusted multiple regression models when comparing the third and the highest serum 25(OH)D quartiles with the lowest (OR = 0.20; 95% CI = 0.05-0.77; OR = 0.17; 95% CI = 0.04-0.64, respectively, P for trend = .009). For each 5 ng/mL increase in serum 25(OH)D, there was a 22% odds decrease in the odds of migraine (OR = 0.78; 95% CI = 0.68-0.90; P = .001). Conclusion: We have found that a higher level of serum VitD (between 50 to less than 100 ng/mL) among a sample of the Iranian population is associated with 80-83% lower odds of migraine headache than those with serum 25(OH)D levels below 20 ng/mL. However, there is a need for well-designed clinical trials to investigate beneficial effects of increased serum 25(OH)D on lower risk of migraine. Keywords: migraine; vitamin D deficiency; vitamin D insufficiency.", 5
"Abstract The clinical findings in eight young homosexual men in New York with Kaposi's sarcoma showed some unusual features. Unlike the form usually seen in North America and Europe, it affected younger men (4th decade rather than 7th decade); the skin lesions wee generalised rather than being predominantly in the lower limbs, and the disease was more aggressive (survival of less than 20 months rather 8-13 years). All eight had had a variety of sexually transmitted diseases. All those tested for cytomegalovirus antibodies and hepatitis B surface antigen of anti-hepatitis B antibody gave positive results. This unusual occurrence of Kaposi's sarcoma in a population much exposed to sexually transmissible diseases suggests that such exposure may play a role in its pathogenesis.", 5
"Abstract A 33-year-old doctor contracted severe acute respiratory syndrome presenting with features of disseminated intravascular coagulopathy without changes in the chest radiograph initially. A CT scan of his chest showed marked lung changes. His condition improved with intravenous methylprednisolone 500 mg daily and ribavirin 1.2 g orally thrice daily. The case illustrates the importance of a break in fever between the viraemic and lung inflammatory phases of the illness that occurs before radiographic changes and which may obscure diagnosis. Careful quarantine and follow-up of these patients are necessary. Coagulopathy is usually uncomplicated and early CT of the chest may elucidate hidden lung changes and facilitate a rapid diagnosis.", 5

Currently, the research on SARS-CoV-2 is in its primary stages. Based on current published evidence, this review systematically summarizes the epidemiology, clinical characteristics, diagnosis, treatment and prevention of COVID-19. It is hoped that this review will help the public to recognize and deal with SARS-CoV-2, and provide a reference for future studies.", 6
"Abstract The pandemic outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is rapidly spreading all over the world. Reports from China showed that about 20% of patients developed severe disease, resulting in a fatality of 4%. In the past two months, we clinical immunologists participated in multi-rounds of MDT (multidiscipline team) discussion on the anti-inflammation management of critical COVID-19 patients, with our colleagues dispatched from Chinese leading PUMC Hospital to Wuhan to admit and treat the most severe patients. Here, from the perspective of clinical immunologists, we will discuss the clinical and immunological characteristics of severe patients, and summarize the current evidence and share our experience in anti-inflammation treatment, including glucocorticoids, IL-6 antagonist, JAK inhibitors and choloroquine/hydrocholoroquine, of patients with severe COVID-19 that may have an impaired immune system.cases and over 3,000 deaths worldwide. In response to this global outbreak, we summarise the current state of knowledge surrounding COVID-19.", 6
"Abstract An unprecedented outbreak of pneumonia of unknown aetiology in Wuhan City, Hubei province in China emerged in December 2019. A novel coronavirus was identified as the causative agent and was subsequently termed COVID-19 by the World Health Organization (WHO). Considered a relative of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), COVID-19 is caused by a betacoronavirus named SARS-CoV-2 that affects the lower respiratory tract and manifests as pneumonia in humans. Despite rigorous global containment and quarantine efforts, the incidence of COVID-19 continues to rise, with 90,870 laboratory-confirmed cases and over 3,000 deaths worldwide. In response to this global outbreak, we summarise the current state of knowledge surrounding COVID-19.", 6
"Abstract The COVID-19 pandemic is a major health crisis affecting several nations, with over 720,000 cases and 33,000 confirmed deaths reported to date. Such widespread outbreaks are associated with adverse mental health consequences. Keeping this in mind, existing literature on the COVID-19 outbreak pertinent to mental health was retrieved via a literature search of the PubMed database. Published articles were classified according to their overall themes and summarized. Preliminary evidence suggests that symptoms of anxiety and depression (16–28%) and self-reported stress (8%) are common psychological reactions to the COVID-19 pandemic, and may be associated with disturbed sleep. A number of individual and structural variables moderate this risk. In planning services for such populations, both the needs of the concerned people and the necessary preventive guidelines must be taken into account. The available literature has emerged from only a few of the affected countries, and may not reflect the experience of persons living in other parts of the world. In conclusion, subsyndromal mental health problems are a common response to the COVID-19 pandemic. There is a need for more representative research from other affected countries, particularly in vulnerable populations.", 6
