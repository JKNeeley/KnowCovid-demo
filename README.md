# Covid19-website

This is the Java11 version of the KnowCovid-19 application. 

The entire repo is ready to deploy into docker-compose services

The only place need to modify is the mainService.js file - replace the IP with the public IP.

Change: 'var serverURL = "http://Your_Server_IP:9090/Covid-19/";'
